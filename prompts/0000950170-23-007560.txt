Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a wearable medical robotics company that offers functional improvement for those with neuromuscular disorders and upper limb paralysis. We develop and market the MyoPro product line. A MyoPro is a myoelectric-controlled upper limb brace, or orthosis. The orthosis is a rigid brace used for the purpose of supporting a patient’s weak or paralyzed arm to enable and help improve functional activities of daily living, or ADLs, in the home and community. It is custom-fabricated by trained professionals during a custom fabrication process for each individual user to meet their specific needs. Our products are designed to help improve function in adults and adolescents with neuromuscular conditions due to brachial plexus injury, stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury and other neurological disorders. We primarily provide devices directly to patients and bill their insurance companies directly, a sales channel we refer to as direct billing. Under direct billing, we may evaluate, measure and fit the MyoPro devices using our own clinical staff or utilize the clinical consulting services of orthotics and prosthetics, or O&P, professionals, for which they are paid a fee. We also sell our products through various other sales channels, including through O&P providers, the Veterans Administration, or VA, and to our distributors in certain accounts and geographic markets outside the United States.

Our goal is to address the need to help regain function to individuals who have suffered partial paralysis and can no longer support or move their arm or hand despite the best efforts of surgeons and rehabilitation therapists.
Our solution, the MyoPro custom fabricated limb orthosis, is for the upper limbs. The concept was originally pioneered in the 1960s, refined in the labs of MIT, and made commercially feasible through our efforts. Partial paralysis is severe muscle weakness or loss of voluntary movement in one or more parts of the body. The MyoPro is listed in the United States with the FDA as a Class II (510(k)-exempt) device (Biofeedback Device). We believe it is the only current device able to help neuromuscular-impaired people regain function in weak arms and hands using their own muscle signals. The device consists of a portable arm brace made of a lightweight metal and includes advanced signal processing software, non-invasive sensors, small motors, and a lightweight battery unit. The product is worn to support the dysfunctional joint and as a functional aid for reaching and grasping and has also been shown to have therapeutic benefits for some users to increase motor control.

The MyoPro’s control technology utilizes an advanced non-invasive human-machine interface based on non-invasive, patented electromyography, or EMG, control technology that continuously monitors and senses, but does not stimulate, the affected muscles. The patient self-initiates movement through his or her weakened muscle signals that indicate the intention to move. In addition to supporting the weakened limb, the MyoPro functions as a neuro-muscular orthotic by helping regain function to the impaired limb similarly to a myoelectric prosthetic for an amputee. It is prescribed by physicians and provided by trained clinical professionals as a custom-fabricated myoelectric elbow-wrist-hand orthosis.

In addition to stroke patients, we believe our technology may be used on medically appropriate patients to improve upper extremity movement in patients with peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, and other neurological disorders, depending on the individual patient’s condition.

Our strategy is to establish ourselves as the market leader in myoelectric limb orthotics, and to build a set of products, software applications, and value-added services based upon our patented technology platform, sized for adults, adolescents and children. We expect to introduce our MyoPal device for pediatric use during calendar year 2024.
The addressable market in the United States for products directed at all individuals with upper extremity paralysis, such as our MyoPro, is substantial, based on an estimated prevalence population of 3 million existing cases of upper extremity paralysis and our estimate that up to 10% of such individuals may be medically qualified candidates for a MyoPro whose insurance may reimburse for the device. In addition, approximately 250,000 new patients are added to the prevalence population each year in the United States as a result of strokes, brachial plexus injuries and other afflictions, although not all of these new chronic patients are suitable for a MyoPro.
 
To assess whether an individual is a medically-qualified candidate for a MyoPro, we and our distribution partners utilize a variety of techniques to evaluate patients, including tele-health video conference sessions, in-person screening days at various locations, and evaluations at clinical facilities where therapists and physicians refer patients for a

MyoPro, which requires a physician’s prescription to be reimbursed by insurance. We use various media to educate individuals about the MyoPro solution for their impaired limbs, and receive referrals from O&P providers and hospitals such as the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and VA Medical Centers.

In most cases, private health insurance companies pay for the MyoPro device, either to us directly or to an O&P provider depending on the patient’s insurance plan. If we are serving the patient directly, then we bill the payer, and if an O&P provider is responsible for working with and delivering the MyoPro to the patient, then we sell the custom-fabricated MyoPro device to the O&P provider at a wholesale price, to which they add their clinical services. In November 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued two codes for the MyoPro, L8701 and L8702. We continue to be in discussions with CMS regarding reimbursement for the MyoPro, with those discussions centering on the appropriate benefit category for the device. We believe the MyoPro should be covered as a custom-fabricated orthosis, or brace, while CMS is currently listing the device as durable medical equipment, or DME. This distinction is relevant for how the device would be reimbursed. It is reimbursed on a lump sum basis if the benefit category is an orthosis, or as a rental over thirteen months under a capped rental program if it is determined that DME is the appropriate benefit category. The current determination of CMS differs from the lump-sum reimbursement currently received from commercial payers, VA hospitals, worker’s compensation, and state Medicaid plans. A new rule has been published by CMS covering the process to request a benefit category change. In conjunction with the publication of this new rule, CMS invited us to present our request to change the benefit category for our MyoPro device to a brace at its public meeting in June 2022. In September 2022, CMS published its determination, deferring its decision on our request, and further stating that coverage and payment for the MyoPro would be at the discretion of its regional Medicare billing contractors, known as the DME MAC’s. We intend to submit additional research for publication before the end of the first quarter of 2023, that is expected to add to existing evidence that the MyoPro is effective, reasonable, necessary and appropriate for Medicare beneficiaries. Once submitted for publication, we intend to meet with the medical directors of the DME MAC’s to discuss coverage and payment for the MyoPro and begin submitting claims for Medicare Part B beneficiaries. In January 2023, CMS published a notice stating that it intends to publish a proposed rule in the coming months regarding the scope of the Medicare Part B benefit for leg, arm, back and neck braces and newer technology devices. We expect this rule to clarify whether CMS considers the MyoPro to be a brace or DME. There is no timetable for CMS to make any coverage or payment decisions, nor is there any guarantee that any such decisions will actually increase access to the MyoPro or result in reimbursement from payers, including Medicare. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of any such decision on the amounts that we may be reimbursed by private insurance companies, if any.

We are the exclusive licensee of 2 U.S. patents for the myoelectric limb orthosis device based on technology originally developed at MIT in collaboration with medical experts affiliated with Harvard Medical School, which will expire by December 2023. We also hold 20 issued patents in the U.S. and various countries and have multiple pending patent applications in the US and international markets. These patents expand upon the MIT patents and extend the life of our patent portfolio to the year 2039. Our intellectual property also consists of trade secrets related to myoelectric control software and mechanical designs from over ten years of R&D and product development activity.

We are headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.

Market Opportunity: Common Causes of Arm Paralysis

Stroke
 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, stroke is one of the leading causes of disability in the U.S. affecting approximately 800,000 people per year. We have working relationships with rehabilitation facilities in the U.S., including the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Kennedy Krieger Institute, and numerous VA Medical Centers, and we have developed an appropriate set of inclusion criteria to determine which persons that are affected by stroke would be medically qualified for the intervention.

Many stroke survivors are left with hemi-paresis, a partial paralysis of one side of the body, which impacts the ability to use their arm and/or hand. Occupational therapy is the common treatment recommended to regain native function for these individuals, and some do recover some movement of the upper limb. However, after 6-12 months of therapy, many patients plateau and continued therapy will not likely result in further improvement. These chronic patients then

enter the prevalence population and become potential candidates for the MyoPro, which we believe is the most cost-effective alternative for regaining function for these individuals.
 
Vehicular and Workplace Accidents

One of the most straightforward applications for the MyoPro is to support the weak arm and help regain arm function to individuals who have suffered peripheral nerve injuries. A common outcome of vehicular and workplace accidents is damage to the nerves in the shoulder known as the brachial plexus. Many individuals recover from their related trauma with the exception of the ability to control their elbow and in some cases their hand. Nerve transfer surgery is often a solution; however, these procedures are not always restorative. In some cases, patients undergo amputation and receive myoelectric prosthetics rather than deal with a paralyzed arm. One of the leading medical facilities in the U.S. for treating brachial plexus injuries is the Mayo Clinic. We have been working with surgeons at the Mayo Clinic who have incorporated the MyoPro into their surgical post-operative treatment protocol to help improve function in upper limbs.
Spinal Cord Injuries

According to the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, spinal cord injuries are second only to strokes as a cause of paralysis, resulting in 27% of cases of paralysis. The level of paralysis depends on where the injury occurs. Currently, medically qualified individuals for a MyoPro include those with incomplete spinal cord injuries having sufficient remaining EMG signal strength to initiate movement of the devices, as determined by the clinician using a MyoPro demonstration unit.
Cerebral Palsy

Based on data provided by the CDC, the prevalence of cerebral palsy, or CP, in the United States is approximately 73,000 for children ages 6-11 years old. CP is caused by brain injury or brain malformation that occurs before, during, or immediately after birth while the infant’s brain is under development.
Birth Brachial Plexus Injuries

During birth, some newborns suffer an injury to the brachial plexus nerve, which can result in arm paralysis. According to Boston Children’s Hospital, one to three births out of 1,000 involve a brachial plexus injury, with roughly 20-30% resulting in arm paralysis. We have been testing our planned pediatric device on children who have suffered this nerve damage to assess its ability to improve function in upper limbs, and this new version of the MyoPro, which we refer to as MyoPal, is expected to be available to these patients during calendar year 2024.
Progressive Conditions

The MyoPro has been prescribed in a few cases for individuals with progressive conditions such as multiple sclerosis and ALS. For individuals with these conditions, the MyoPro is used for functional improvement that may help provide strength conservation and help to extend the time they can maintain independence. As users continue to progress with their condition, settings can be adjusted to provide increasing amounts of assistance.
Arm Paralysis Solutions & Treatments

The standard of care for treating paralysis varies by diagnosis. In the case of neurological injuries such as stroke, occupational / physical therapy is the standard of care. Each year, stroke and other survivors undergo months of rehabilitation. Unfortunately, many are left with long term hemiparesis, which is weakness on one side of the body. Interventions such as electrical stimulation, static braces, and continued therapy are available, and yet the prevalence of chronic upper limb paralysis is in the millions.
Our Solutions

Although commercial products for powered prosthetics have been available since the 1970s, we believe that powered orthotics have been held back by issues related to weight, comfort, and the technological capability of microprocessors and software. The MyoPro is known in the medical community as a custom fabricated limb orthosis. It is created

individually for each patient from a cast, just like a prosthetic, except the MyoPro is appropriate for someone who still has a limb that is non-functional. Beginning in 2022, we enabled the use of remote measurement and 3D printing techniques in order to create the orthotic parts for the device, which has reduced the number of in-person visits by our clinical field staff.

Orthotic devices are provided by clinical professionals who custom fabricate and fit these devices. According to the American Orthotics and Prosthetics Association, there are more than 2,000 member O&P facilities located in the U.S. Additionally, the VA has been a pioneer in O&P. In fact, the design of the MyoPro Motion G powered grasp product is rooted in research conducted at the Boston-area VA in the 1990s. This research demonstrated that it is technically feasible to design a myoelectric elbow-hand orthosis; however, we believe that the product was not commercially practical until we were able to incorporate recent technological developments such as improved microprocessors and software, lightweight materials and motors, and smaller batteries to create an acceptable orthosis for users.
The MyoPro can enable individuals to self-initiate and control movements of a partially paralyzed or weakened limb using their own muscle signals. When the user tries to move, our patented EMG control system uses sensors to detect the weak muscle signal and to activate a motor to move the limb in the desired direction. The user is in control of their own limb; the brace amplifies their weak muscle signal to regain function to the affected joint. Importantly, the EMG-driven device requires that users are actively engaged throughout the movement; if they stop trying to move, the device stops. With our product, a paralyzed individual, such as one who has suffered a brachial plexus injury, stroke or other neuromuscular disorder can experience improved function in performing ADLs including feeding, reaching and lifting.

Each MyoPro brace is custom fabricated for each patient for optimum mobility and performance. To qualify for a MyoPro, candidates must meet a comprehensive set of requirements determined by a trained clinical professional during an evaluation. These criteria include long term partial paralysis, detection of a muscle signal sufficient to control the device, demonstrated cognitive abilities, and lack of other conditions that might limit the effectiveness or safety of the device such as use of certain pharmaceuticals, high levels of pain, or limits to range of motion, as well as falling within measurement limitations for the arm and hand to be able to fit into the device. Finally, candidates must have meaningful and achievable functional goals that can realistically be accomplished with the device that cannot otherwise be achieved with other interventions.

Should the individual qualify, we (in the case of direct billing) or the O&P provider will determine whether the device may be covered by the individual’s health insurance. If reimbursement is approved and the individual is a suitable candidate for a MyoPro, then the fabrication and fitting process is undertaken:
•First, we capture the shape of the patient’s arm, either through in-person measurement or utilizing telehealth and remote measurement equipment in order to obtain the patient’s measurements. Once the patient’s arm measurements are captured, the orthotic parts are 3D printed based on these measurements. The fabrication of the brace is completed in-house. 
 •Fabrication typically takes approximately 2 weeks. Once the brace is fabricated, it is delivered to the patient either by us or by an O&P practice, who will fit the device on the patient. During this fitting, the device will be calibrated to the user’s individual muscle signal profile using our proprietary software, and minor adjustments to the brace can be made to optimize comfort. 
 •The patient will be provided with initial training and a set of take-home tasks to practice with the brace donned. We now also provide a video game platform called MyoGames, which offers the patient an additional means to master the device. We or the O&P provider will then refer the MyoPro user to a local therapist for continued training and practice with their new device, and we have a staff of occupational therapists and other qualified clinicians who train and support these therapists. Finally, under our MyoCare program, a coach is assigned to each patient and follows and guides the patient for the first year of the patient’s journey with the MyoPro in order to maximize each patient’s outcomes with the device.
 
In a cost-conscious healthcare environment, we believe that the use of the MyoPro is compelling since it enables functional improvement that can help users improve their ability to perform ADL’s, which may allow them to return to work or improve their ability to be independent and remain at home. In the U.S., 7% of adults aged 65 and over require daily help with ADLs, with such long term support services consuming almost 10% of all healthcare spending. We believe that helping regain upper limb function to these individuals may result in fewer emergency room visits

related to falls, increase their level of activity, and avoid the need for institutionalization. With approximately 70 million baby boomers headed into their retirement years, we believe that it is vital to keep beneficiaries in the lowest cost of care setting — the home.

Research and Development

We are committed to investing in a robust product development program and to supporting a variety of clinical research studies to enhance our products, increase the body of evidence to support prescribing and reimbursing our devices, and to grow our range of product offerings. Our R&D team is comprised of engineers with a mix of BS and MS degrees in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, robotics engineering and computer science and augmented by outside resources as needed. The R&D team seeks to combine innovative research conducted over the last 50 years with cutting edge innovations in robotics, machine learning, and material science to continue to enhance our products and product offerings. Our regulatory, clinical, and customer service personnel work closely with our suppliers and providers to promote compliance with quality standards and good manufacturing processes, which we believe result in a high-quality product and limited customer issues.

We have continually enhanced our product offerings by increasing functionality for users by the addition of a multi-articulated wrist and introducing a powered grasp for the hand. Our flagship product is the MyoPro 2, introduced in June 2017, which features improvements in control technology, new configuration software and user interface, and a longer-lasting, pop-out battery for extended use of the brace and convenient replacement. In January 2022, we introduced the MyoPro2+, which is a lighter and more advanced version of the device, which includes 3D printed orthotics, software enhancements and a new design that facilitates easier donning and doffing of the device.
 
We plan, depending on available resources, to continually improve our system architecture and develop new product innovations that increase the value and breadth of our product offerings. During calendar year 2024, we expect to launch MyoPal, a pediatric version of the MyoPro which is designed to meet the needs of younger patients suffering from arm and hand paralysis.

Clinical Research Studies

Evidence of effectiveness involving myoelectric orthotics dates back to 1967. We have partnered with leading researchers to study the impact of the technology to regain function to a paralyzed joint as well as the real-world benefit that comes from being able to independently perform ADLs in the home, vocational tasks at work, and community activities such as shopping. A study was published in January 2017 that demonstrated the instantaneous reduction in upper limb impairment and increase in ability to complete functional tasks for chronic stroke patients. In addition to the previous published research, several institutions have active funded research programs. In February 2022, researchers with the Cleveland VA published a study showing clinically significant gains in motor function in individuals with chronic moderate-to-sever arm weakness. Currently funded studies include a recently funded study of the device for patients with spinal cord injury, or SCI at Kessler Rehabilitation Center in New Jersey. These studies focused on the ability of MyoPro users to initiate movement of their affected limbs and perform ADLs such as picking up objects so that they may feed themselves and live more independently. In 2021, we launched an internal outcomes patient registry to collect data on a number of patient outcomes from use of the MyoPro in their homes. This is an ongoing study that will provide valuable insight into long term outcomes and will also drive future development of the MyoPro. Before the end of the first quarter of 2023, we expect to submit research for publication regarding the ability of MyoPro users to perform activities of daily living from data obtained from our outcomes registry. In addition to the studies Myomo is directly involved in, various clinical facilities are undertaking their own research projects on the outcomes of MyoPro users, including a recent publication detailing outcomes for patients with brachial plexus injuries, or BPI, by the Mayo Clinic. In non-clinical based research, the University of Utah has been awarded grant funding to study and improve the control systems that communicate muscle intention for better control of the motors on the MyoPro brace. This could lead to future collaboration between Myomo and the University of Utah if new intellectual property is developed.
Sales and Marketing

Our strategic goal is to develop and commercialize products that become the standard of care for individuals with paralysis who cannot be successfully treated with conventional interventions such as rehabilitation therapy. Our strategy is to establish ourselves as a market leader in myoelectric-controlled orthotics by building a set of products, software applications, and value-added services based upon our patented technology platform. In addition to our recent

geographic expansion to serve more areas in the United States, we are entering international markets via local partnerships and distribution arrangements to meet the large global need that we believe exists for individuals with upper limb paralysis.

We utilize digital ads on various platforms as well as television ads to educate and inform patients who are potential candidates for our product. Once the prospective patient contacts us or is referred to us, either our trained clinical staff or a trained O&P provider will evaluate the patient for their suitability as a candidate. In instances where we are the provider, the initial evaluation is typically conducted using a telehealth platform. Prior to obtaining authorizations from commercial insurance companies, the patient’s medical records are collected and reviewed to make sure the device is appropriate for their condition and a prescription and letter of medical necessity are typically obtained from the patient’s physician. Once these documents are obtained, our patient advocacy team submits a pre-authorization request to the patient’s insurer. If we receive a pre-authorization, we will proceed to measure the patient’s arm and hand, print orthotic parts using 3D printing techniques, then fabricate the MyoPro and deliver it to the patient. This process is what we refer to as direct billing. We also call on hospitals and O&P practices that provide our products to their patients as well as indirect sales through distributors in Europe and Australia. The MyoPro product line has been approved by the VA system for impaired veterans, and approximately 70 VA facilities have already ordered devices for their patients.

Since we began marketing our products directly to patients in 2019, our business development efforts have focused on developing a pipeline of patients in our reimbursement process and expanding the number of payers reimbursing for our products. As of December 31, 2022, 1,153 patients were in our reimbursement pipeline, a 43% increase compared to 808 patients in the pipeline at December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, 164 MyoPro units were in backlog, which we define as patients for whom we received insurance authorization, but revenue has not been recognized, with an estimated revenue value of $7.6 million, which is a 9% increase over 154 patients in backlog at December 31, 2021. As a cost savings measure, during 2023 we intend to focus our efforts only on those patients in our pipeline with payers who have reimbursed for our products. We have suspended activities and reduced expenditures directed to growing the number of payers reimbursing for our product until CMS begins to reimburse or states that it intends to reimburse for the MyoPro. Excluding patients with payers who have not previously reimbursed for our products, our patient pipeline was 794 patients as of December 31, 2022, a 50% increase over the comparable pipeline of 528 patients as of December 31, 2021. We refer to this measure of the pipeline as our Adjusted Pipeline. In conjunction with our intention to only focus on those patients in our Adjusted Pipeline, we reduced our workforce by 12% in January 2023. This action and other intended costs reductions are expected to save approximately $2 million in 2023. While we intend to focus only on patients in our Adjusted Pipeline in 2023, the impact on backlog and revenues is expected to be deminimus, as approximately 98% of our direct billing revenues in 2022 came from patients with payers that comprise our Adjusted Pipeline.
 
To bring the MyoPro to what we believe is the large number of potential patients outside of the U.S., in July 2017 we met the criteria to apply the CE Mark, which is a manufacturer’s declaration that the product complies with the essential requirements of the relevant European Union health, safety and environmental protection legislation for the MyoPro so that it can be marketed in Europe. In October 2017 we obtained our medical device license for Canada, enabling us to provide the MyoPro to patients in that country. We have entered into distribution agreements with O&P providers in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, Italy and Australia, and have received a number of MyoPro orders from providers outside the United States in 2022.

Competition

An individual with difficulty walking has a wide range of technology alternatives from canes and crutches to powered wheelchairs and exoskeleton suits. However, those with paralysis of the arm, wrist, and hand, whose physical challenges that we seek to address, have few options to regain function.
Rehabilitation Therapy

Rehabilitation therapy is the standard of care for upper extremity paralysis and a prerequisite to qualifying for a myoelectric orthosis such as the MyoPro. After a stroke or other traumatic injury, a large portion of survivors regain

much or all of their function. However, every year there are many survivors whose upper extremities remain paralyzed despite best efforts of rehabilitation therapists.

Non-Powered Braces

Some individuals are able to accomplish their functional goals with braces that are non-powered or use springs to offset forces of gravity or muscle tightness, referred to as spasticity. Medical professionals who evaluate patients for myoelectric orthotics screen out individuals who could accomplish their goals with a simpler, less costly intervention such as these braces.

Experimental Surgery: Battelle and Thomas Jefferson University — Brain Implants

An array of experimental interventions currently is being researched at universities and non-profit research facilities around the world. One such innovation recently announced by Battelle Memorial Institute in Ohio and Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia involves a craniotomy, which is a surgical opening into the skull performed to implant a sensor chip in the brain. An electrical cable is connected to the top of the head connecting to a system that sends pulses of electrical stimulation to activate muscles in the forearm or to control the MyoPro brace. The procedure is experimental, invasive, and costly, but may be offered as an alternative to a myoelectric orthosis.
Exoskeleton Suits

During the last few years, a number of companies have emerged to provide exoskeleton suits that enable those with lower extremity paralysis to stand and walk again. Companies in this space include ReWalk, Ekso Bionics, and Cyberdyne. It is possible that companies may begin to compete with solutions such as ours for the upper extremity. Ekso Bionics has recently announced a product to be used only for rehab therapy at a hospital, and we can provide no assurance that these or other companies are not currently developing competing products for the home market.
Potential New Products from O&P Manufacturers

If our business grows, interest may develop among new or existing manufacturers of other O&P devices that compete with the MyoPro, which may or may not challenge the validity of our intellectual property. Some new products have been introduced that compete with the MyoPro from companies such as Vincent Systems and HKK in Germany.
Intellectual Property

The MyoPro is protected by two core patents exclusively licensed from MIT for the life of the patents. The first patent (U.S. Pat. No. 7,396,337) covers a powered orthotic device, worn over a patient’s elbow or other joint that senses relatively low-level muscle signals in the vicinity of the joint generated by a patient. In response to the relatively low-level signals, the powered orthotic device moves, causing the patient’s body part to move about the joint accordingly with adjustable force and assistance settings. The patent expires on December 1, 2023. The second patent (U.S. Pat. No. 7,367,958) covers a method of providing rehabilitation movement training for a person suffering from nerve damage, stroke, spinal cord injury, neurological trauma or neuromuscular disorder by moving a body part about a joint using a powered orthotic device. The patent claims methods that include moving the body part about the joint in two directions based on an EMG signal from a muscle associated with that body part or moving the body part about the joint in one direction based on the EMG signal and in another direction based on a return force in the absence of a sensed EMG signal. This patent expires on November 21, 2023, which represents the earliest patent expiration among Myomo’s intellectual property portfolio.

The two patent licenses discussed above were granted pursuant to the MIT License. Under the MIT License, we have been granted access to those certain patent rights in exchange for the payment of royalties, which vary based on the level of our net sales. As part of the MIT License, we must pay a nonrefundable annual license maintenance fee which may be credited to any royalty amounts due in that same year. The license agreement can be terminated if certain sales

targets are not achieved. The future minimum amounts due under this agreement is $25,000 for the final year of the agreement in 2023.

Under the MIT License, we issued 6,172 shares of our common stock to MIT. They have the right to purchase additional shares of our common stock to maintain their pro rata ownership.

Myomo has 20 of its own issued patents as well. These additional patents cover our MyoPro Motion G product. The Motion G product, which allows for the movement of multiple joints as compared to a single joint, which is the technology that underlies the patents licensed from MIT. The Motion G generated 97% of our product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. In January 2013, Myomo’s patent entitled Powered Orthotic Device was granted in Europe (European Patent No. 2079361), which is validated (currently in force) in six European countries. In June 2014, a substantially similar patent was granted in Japan (Japanese Patent No. 5557529). In November 2013 and January 2015, Myomo’s two U.S. patents issued entitled Powered Orthotic Device and Method of Using Same (U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,585,620 and 8,926,534, respectively). On July 26, 2016, Myomo’s third U.S. patent was issued (U.S. Pat. No. 9,398,994). In September 2020, Myomo’s fourth U.S. patent was issued entitled Powered Orthotic Device and Method of Using the Same (U.S. Pat No. 10758394B2). Similar patents have been issued in China, Hong Kong, and Japan and is validated (currently in force) in six European countries (European Patent No. 3307225). We also have 4 pending U.S. patent applications and 11 foreign applications under examination. We plan to continue to file additional patent applications over time. The longest term of our patents extends intellectual property rights until 2039.

In terms of trademarks, the terms Myomo, MyoPro, MyoPal and MyoCare are registered as trademarks with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. Our trademarks were initially registered in 2013 and 2014. Within the first ten years from the registration dates shown above, we will be required to complete two (2) “maintenance” filings, one between the 5th and 6th years and the second between the 9th and 10th years. Each successive 10-year period thereafter we will be required to complete a “maintenance” filing between every 9th and 10th year.

Government Regulation

The MyoPro device and our operations including our supply chain and distribution channels are subject to regulation by the FDA and various other U.S. federal and state agencies. Under the FFDCA, medical devices are classified as Class I, Class II or Class III, depending on the degree of risk associated with the device, what is known about the type of device, and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Classification of a device is important because the class to which a device is assigned determines, among other things, the necessity and type of FDA premarket review. We have elected to list the MyoPro Family of products under a Class II device classification regulation for biofeedback devices. Under the classification regulation, we believe our device remains 510(k)-exempt as a battery powered, external limb orthosis device that is indicated for muscle relaxation or muscle re-education are generally 510(k)-exempt under the classification regulation. While we believe our device to be exempt from FDA premarket review, our device is subject to FDA’s post-market requirements, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and
promotional materials.

We are also subject to regulation by foreign governmental agencies in connection with international sales. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of our medical device products. In the European Union, or EU, medical devices are regulated under the European Medical Devices Regulation, or the EU MDR, which was effective in May 2020. An authorized third-party, also called a Notified Body, must approve products for CE marking and conducts periodic inspections to ensure applicable regulatory requirements are met. The CE mark is contingent upon continued compliance to the applicable regulations and the quality system requirements of the ISO 13485 standard.

Under the new EU MDR requirements, CE certificates issued under the previous directives prior to May 2020 will remain valid in accordance with their term, beyond the expiration of the transition period, however certain limitations set forth in the EU MDR, such as the need to use classifications that are different from the previous directives, would apply.


We, together with Cogmedix, our primary contract manufacturer, actively maintain FDA 21 CFR Part 820 QSR and ISO 13485 Quality Management Systems for product design and development, manufacturing, distribution, and customer feedback processes. Following the introduction of a product, the FDA and comparable foreign agencies may engage in periodic audits of our quality management system, the product performance, and our advertising and promotional materials. These regulatory controls, as well as any changes in the policies of the FDA or comparable foreign agencies, can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction and continued availability of new products. We work to anticipate these factors in our product development processes.

We have declared conformity to European Directives and apply the CE Mark for distribution of the MyoPro product line in Europe, and we have a Medical Device License for Canada. In addition, Myomo has recently obtained certification of our Quality System, or QS, to the Medical-Device-Single-Audit-Program, or MDSAP. This certifies compliance of the QS for sales in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia, and Japan. If we enter into other jurisdictions with additional international partners, we will need to seek the appropriate government approval to supply the devices in these countries. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to various administrative and legal actions against us, such as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions.
 
Healthcare and Privacy Laws and Regulation
 
As an accredited Medicare provider, we are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, CMS, the Office of Inspector General and Office for Civil Rights, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.

Additionally, healthcare providers and third-party payers play a primary role in the recommendation of medical devices and other medical items and services. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payers and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals, patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare and privacy laws and regulations, include the following:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a medical device manufacturer and DME suppliers (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, or in return for, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order of a medical device or DME for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus imprisonment and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act, or FCA. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution; 
 •the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the FCA, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. DME companies that submit claims directly to payers may also be liable under the FCA for the direct submission of such claims. The 


FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs;
•the federal civil monetary penalties laws, which impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer or remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; 
 •the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it; 
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions; 
 •the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to HHS, under the Open Payments Program, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; 
 •federal price reporting laws, which require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on approved products; and 
 •analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers or patients; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state and local laws that require the licensure of sales representatives; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions that may be more stringent than those in the United States (such as the European Union, which adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018); state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the 


same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers.

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities, including compensation of physicians with stock or stock options to serve on our Scientific Advisory Board could, despite efforts to comply, be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Moreover, efforts to ensure that our business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, integrity and oversight agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the commercialization of any of our products outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.

Health Insurance Reimbursement

In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed medical devices for their conditions and providers delivering the prescribed devices generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. MyoPro devices are typically reimbursed by the patient’s health insurance plan, which include government health programs in the United States such Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. To obtain approval for reimbursement, payers require various items which may include a physician’s written order, a history of the patient’s medical condition and past treatment, and demonstration of medical necessity. Factors payers consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is: a covered benefit under its health plan; safe, effective, and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost effective, and neither experimental nor investigational.
 
Our Patient Advocacy Team assists patients and O&P providers in developing and submitting this documentation for coverage of the prescribed MyoPro. Since the MyoPro is a relatively new device, payers may not be familiar with the device, and in some cases, payers may deem it to be experimental or investigational and establish non-coverage policies for the device. National and regional commercial plans, worker’s compensation programs, auto insurance carriers, Medicare Advantage plans, and some state Medicaid plans have paid for the MyoPro orthosis. The process usually requires obtaining a pre-authorization of the MyoPro for the patient, and if the authorization request is initially denied by the payer, we support the patient, or the O&P provider as the case may be, in appealing the decision. We have been successful in obtaining coverage for the MyoPro on a case by case basis and we continue to follow up on other cases in our reimbursement pipeline which are pending an insurance decision.

As of January 1, 2019, two HCPCS codes for the MyoPro, L8701 and L8702, issued by CMS, went into effect. CMS elected to classify the MyoPro for Medicare beneficiaries as DME to be provided to patients under a capped rental payment system, where we believe providers are typically paid monthly over a period of thirteen months. We are continuing to work with CMS on publishing reimbursement guidelines for our product. . In June 2022, we presented our request to CMS to change our benefit category to a brace. In September 2022, CMS published its determination that it needed more time to determine how to proceed to resolve what it referred to as a “complex issue”, further stating that coverage and payment for the MyoPro would be at the discretion of the DME MAC’s. We intend to meet with the medical directors of the DME MAC’s to discuss coverage and payment for the MyoPro and begin submitting claims for Medicare Part B beneficiaries in early 2023.

There is no guarantee that the future level of reimbursement payments for the MyoPro directly to us or to our O&P distributors will be sufficient to cover the cost of the MyoPro device, the clinical services to evaluate and fit patients, and the other support services associated with provisioning of products to patients. Further, reimbursement levels may

affect the number of O&P providers who wish to supply the MyoPro and may limit patient access to the technology depending on the policies of their health insurance plans.

Current and Future Legislation
 
The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could affect our ability to profitably sell MyoPro. Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.

In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives and legal challenges to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the United States medical device industry to which we sell our products. Among other things, the ACA:
•established a 2.3% excise tax on sales of medical devices with respect to any entity that manufactures or imports specified medical devices offered for sale in the United States, although this provision was subsequently repealed in December 2019; 
 •established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research; 
 •implemented payment system reforms, including a national pilot program to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain health care services through bundled payment models; and 
 •created an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate. 
 
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures in Congress or through executive orders, if any, to challenge repeal or replace the ACA, will impact our business.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, resulted in aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

In response to perceived increases in healthcare costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the Presidential administrations, members of Congress, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the United States healthcare system, including by repealing or replacing the ACA. Many elements of health care reform such as comparative effectiveness research, payment system reforms including shared savings pilots and other provisions could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and may materially adversely impact numerous aspects of our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Manufacturing

Myomo’s custom fabricated orthosis is comprised of two elements. The first is the electromechanical kit. The kit consists of the motor units, processor, sensors, and battery. Manufacturing for the electromechanical kit is provided by

our supplier Cogmedix, a wholly owned subsidiary of Coughlin Companies in Worcester, MA. The second element is the custom fabrication of the orthosis itself from measurements obtained either in person or remotely. A third-party vendor creates the orthotic parts from these measurements and the fabrication of the device is done in our facility in Boston, MA.

If the volume and geographic reach of our sales expand, we may seek additional sources for manufacturing and custom fabrication of the devices as our needs may require.

Employees and Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed a total of 100 full time employees and 6 part time employees. In January 2023 we reduced our headcount by 12%. All employees are subject to contractual agreements that specify requirements for confidentiality, ownership of newly developed intellectual property and restrictions on working for competitors as well as other matters. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees and personnel. Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, support for programs that enable continued learning and growth and an employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. We value diversity at all levels and seek to make our workforce as diverse and inclusive as we can and offer advancement opportunities based on merit and performance.
