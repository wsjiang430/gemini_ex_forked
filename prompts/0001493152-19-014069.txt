Business Overview
 
Agape ATP Corporation is a company which provides health solution advisory services to our clients. We are focusing our efforts on attracting customers in Malaysia. Our advisory services center on the “ATP Zeta Health Program”, which is a health program designed to effectively prevent diseases caused by polluted environments, unhealthy dietary intake and unhealthy lifestyles, and promotion of health. The program aims to promote improved health and longevity in our clients through a combination of modern medicine, proper nutrition and advice from skilled nutritionists and/or dieticians.
 
At its core, the ATP Zeta Super Health Program is focused upon biological energy, Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), at the cellular level. The stimulation of ATP production at the cellular level can increase the metabolism and service to promote and maintain normal and healthy functioning of the body’s systems. As a strong advocator of “beauty from within”, our program shall emphasize nutrient absorption through the membrane ion channel to provide complete and balanced nutrients to improve cell health. Thus, ATP Zeta Super Health Program provides ionized and high zeta potential (high bioavailability) nutrients to enhance the absorption at the cellular level.

The ATP Zeta Super Health Program consists of ten products. None of these products are owned or produced by Agape ATP Corporation. In the event that any of these products are no longer produced, or are otherwise unavailable, we may have to devote significant effort to identifying and obtaining comparable replacement products. The ten products that comprise the ATP Zeta Super Health Program are ATP1s Survivor Select, ATP2 Energized Mineral Concentrate, ATP3 Ionized Cal-Mag, ATP4 Omega Blend, ATP5 BetaMaxx, AGN-Vege Fruit Fiber, AGP1-Iron, YFA-Young Formula, Mitogize and ORYC-Organic Youth Care Cleansing Bar.
 
At present, our products are primarily sold in Malaysia, and due to the contents and combination of the main ingredients in the products they are categorized as health food rather than medicines or drugs. As such, all products require authorization from the Food and Quality Division of Ministry of Health according to the Food Act of 1983 and Food Regulation 1985 in order to be sold in the country. All of the products in the ATP Zeta Super Health Program have obtained the appropriate authorizations.
 
As part of a continuous effort to increase market share of the health and wellness industry that is growing at an exponential rate, we will also evaluate adding additional products to the ATP Zeta Super Health Program; and considering the potential of the synergies between the health and beauty sectors, we will further involve ourselves in the topical approach of skin and hair regime.
 
Currently, all our products are acquired from unrelated third parties and rebranded by the Company. We have no expenditures or expenses relating to research and development of our products for our last two fiscal years. We leverage on t smart partnerships models that we have formed, collaborating with our customers and clients to understand the health and wellness market via a process of consultative review. We then communicate our findings and proposals to third-party suppliers to improve formulations, to bring about new products for customers who are ready to market to end-users. We refer to our approach as “the Power of 3”, which we take great pride in. In the future, we will explore sourcing from third party manufacturers located in Australia, the United States, Germany and Malaysia.

Future Plans
 
In the future, we plan to hire at least five to ten salespeople for every country in which we operate. At present, we do not have any salesforce. It will also be necessary for us to acquire office space from to conduct operations, have meetings with potential clients, and store acquired inventory. We anticipate operating primarily in Malaysia and expanding into the Asian markets in the future, with a particular focus, at least initially, on expanding into Thailand, Indonesia and Taiwan. At present, we do not have any distinct timeline in place for expansion into these countries.
 
We plan to hire more employees to support our operations in different countries. We believe that hiring fifteen to twenty employees will be sufficient in order to support our operations. We also plan to allocate funds to research new products for the ATP Zeta Super Health Program. However, such development will require intensive research, development and testing. We cannot accurately determine a definitive timeline at present nor have we determined an appropriate budget for these future activities. We may also evaluate potential acquisitions in the future which we feel may have some synergy with our current operations.
 
Marketing
 
Agape ATP Corporation plans to penetrate the marketplace and attract customers by building our brand image through print ads, and possibly online paid advertisements, in order to create brand awareness. We are developing a corporate website which will introduce the ATP Zeta Super Health Program. We will market our advisory services through this corporate website and utilize marketing related search engines to attract potential clients to our website. Additionally, we will further our marketing activities through social networking websites.
Competition
 
The health and wellness industry, with a focus on health supplements in particular in Malaysia, where Agape ATP Corporation plans to operate, is rather competitive. Our focus is on the mature group of customers, i.e. adults ranging in age from 18-65 years old. We face competition from various retail health supplement providers, pharmacies, and Multi-Level Marketing Companies which supply health supplement products, such as Bio-Life Marketing Sdn Bhd, Elken Group, Usana Group, BMS Organics, NHF Group and their respective affiliates. These competitors are generating significant traffic to their marketing websites; and have established brand recognition and financial resources.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our type of market include the quality of health supplements, the efficacies of the health supplements, strength and depth of relationships with clients, the ability to identify the changing needs and requirements of prospective clients, and the scope of services. Through utilizing our competitive strengths we believe that we have a competitive edge over other competitors due to the breadth of our product offerings, one stop convenience, pricing, our services, our reputation and product safety. We are confident we can develop and enlarge our market share in the Malaysian market and potentially further into the overseas market.
 
Customers
 
For the year ended June 30, 2019, revenue of the Company from the sale of healthy food products from its existing sales channel increased approximately three times from $487,005 to $1,546,057, as compared to the same period last year.
