Overview

DMC Global Inc. operates two technical product and process business segments, DynaEnergetics and NobelClad, which collectively serve the energy, industrial and infrastructure markets. DynaEnergetics designs, manufactures and distributes products utilized by the global oil and gas industry principally for the perforation of oil and gas wells. NobelClad is a global leader in the production of explosion-welded clad metal plates for use in the construction of corrosion resistant industrial processing equipment and specialized transition joints. Both DynaEnergetics and NobelClad operate globally through an international network of manufacturing, distribution and sales facilities. See Note 6 within Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for net sales, operating income, and total assets for each of our segments. 
Our Strategy
Our diversified segments each provide a suite of unique technical products to niche sectors of the global energy, industrial and infrastructure markets, and each has established a strong position in the markets in which it participates. With an underlying focus on generating free cash flow, our objective is to sustain and grow the market share of our businesses through increased market penetration, development of new applications, and research and development of new and adjacent products that can be sold across our global sales and distribution network. We routinely explore acquisitions of related businesses that could strengthen or add to our existing product portfolios, or expand our geographic footprint and market presence. We also seek acquisition opportunities outside our current markets that would complement our existing businesses, diversify our end markets and revenue streams, and enable us to build a stronger company. 
Business Segments
DynaEnergetics
DynaEnergetics designs, manufactures, markets and sells perforating systems and associated hardware for the international oil and gas industry. The oil and gas industry uses perforating products to punch holes in the casing or liner of wells and create a flow path in the formation, thereby connecting the well to the surrounding reservoir. During the drilling process, steel casing and cement are inserted into the well to isolate and support the wellbore. As part of the well completion process, the perforating guns, which contain a series of specialized shaped charges, are lowered into the well to the desired area of the targeted formation. When initiated, the shaped charges shoot a plasma jet through the casing and cement and into the formation. The resulting channels in the formation allow hydrocarbons to flow into the wellbore.

DynaEnergetics designs, manufactures and sells all five primary components of a perforating system, which are: 1) carrier tubes and charge tubes, 2) shaped charges, 3) detonating cord, 4) detonators and initiating systems, and 5) control panels. In addition, DynaEnergetics has leveraged its broad product portfolio and detonator technology to create a unique factory-assembled, performance-assured well perforating system known as DynaStage® The DynaStage system arrives fully assembled at the well, thereby reducing the customers’ need for field assembly crews and associated infrastructure. 
PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF A PERFORATING SYSTEM
The types of perforating products manufactured by DynaEnergetics are essential to oil and gas recovery. These products are sold to oilfield service companies around the world. DynaEnergetics also promotes its technologies and systems directly with end-user exploration and production companies. The level of market activity for perforating products, which are used during the well completion process, generally corresponds with the level of oil and gas exploration and production ("E&P") activity. Modern E&P activity has led to increasingly complex well completion operations, which in turn have increased the demand for high quality and technically advanced perforating products.
Operations
The DynaEnergetics segment seeks to build on its products and technologies, as well as its sales, supply chain and distribution network. During the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the DynaEnergetics segment represented approximately 73%, 63% and 42% of our consolidated net sales, respectively.
DynaEnergetics has been producing detonating cord and detonators and selling these along with seismic explosives systems for decades. Since 1994, the business has placed significant emphasis on enhancing its offering by improving existing products and adding new products through research and development as well as acquisitions. Today, DynaEnergetics offers a comprehensive portfolio of detonating cord, detonators, bi-directional boosters, shaped charges, and corresponding gun systems.
In recent years, DynaEnergetics has increased its development efforts and introduced several new products specifically designed for safe and selective perforating, particularly in North America’s growing onshore, unconventional oil and gas industry. Included among these products is the DynaSelectTM family of "intrinsically safe," integrated switch-detonators. DynaSelect detonators require a specific electronic code for firing and are immune from induced currents and voltages, static electricity and high-frequency irradiation. These safety features substantially reduce the risk of unintentional detonation and 
2

enable concurrent perforating and hydraulic fracturing operations at drilling sites with multiple wellbores, improving operating efficiencies for customers.
Our DynaSelect products integrate our earlier Selectronic Switches with our "intrinsically safe" detonator technologies in a unique one-piece system for improved well site efficiency, reliability, simplicity and service quality. The fully integrated design incorporates advanced software controls and reduces the size of the detonator and switch assembly. DynaSelect reduces by 40% the number of electrical connections required within each perforating gun versus traditional selective initiation systems. This reduces set-up times and significantly increases reliability. The DynaSelect detonator is controlled by our Multitronic IV and V Firing Panels. These systems enable safe and reliable firing of up to 20 guns and setting a plug in a single run and incorporates a shot detection function resulting in significant time and cost savings.
Our DynaStage factory-assembled perforating system combines all our advanced technologies into a preassembled perforating gun that can be armed at the well site with the wireless DynaStage detonator, which incorporates all of the features of the intrinsically safe DynaSelect detonator. The DynaStage system is operated using Multitronic IV and our latest Multitronic V Firing Panel, and can be tested before going down hole using our Surface Tester, reducing the risk of lost time, mishaps, misruns and misfires due to a system fault. The Multitronic V Firing Panel is highly intuitive and allows the gun string to be safely tested and monitored throughout the pump-down operation. The Multitronic V panel introduces several new features designed to ease the use and the reliability of the system, including “shoot-on-the-fly” operation through an instant-fire capability. The patented plug-n-go design of the DynaStage wireless detonator reduces the potential for errors by eliminating the need for wiring and crimping. 
Our DynaSlotTM perforating system is designed for well abandonment operations. During abandonment, the wellbore is encased and permanently sealed so that layers of sedimentary rock, and in particular freshwater aquifers, are pressure isolated from each other and the wellbore. The DynaSlot perforating system facilitates this process by creating access to a full 360-degree area between the rock formations and the tubing and casing. Customers use the unique, helical perforation pattern created by DynaSlot to perform cement squeeze operations that seal off the wellbore.
DynaEnergetics develops and sells a wide range of shaped charges for use in its perforating systems. These include the family of HaloFrac™ charges, which incorporate advancements in liner materials and shaped charge geometry designed to improve hydraulic fracturing performance through lower and more consistent breakdown pressures, uniform proppant placement, uniform frac clusters and higher well productivity ratios. Another line, FracTune™, delivers uniform hole diameter in the well casing independent of shot phasing and gun positioning within the well bore. DynaEnergetics also sells the DPEX™ family of charges, which feature energetic liners. All three lines can be used with the DynaStage perforating system as well as conventional perforating gun systems across a range of gun diameters.
DynaEnergetics Tubing Conveyed Perforating ("TCP") systems are customized for individual customer needs and well applications. TCP enables perforating of more complex highly deviated and horizontal wells. These types of wells are increasingly being drilled by the off-shore industry. TCP tools also perforate long intervals in a single trip, which significantly improves rig efficiency. Our TCP tool range includes mechanical and hydraulic firing systems, gun releases, redundant firing heads, under-balancing devices and auxiliary components. Our tools are designed to withstand downhole temperatures of up to 260 degrees Celsius (500 degrees Fahrenheit), for safe and quick assembly at the well site, and to allow unrestricted total system length. 
DynaEnergetics’ manufacturing facilities are located in Germany, the United States and Russia. During the first half of 2018, DynaEnergetics added a second automated DynaSelect detonator line at its facility in Troisdorf, Germany, and plans to add two additional detonator lines there by the end of the second quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2018, DynaEnergetics completed construction of 74,000 square feet of new manufacturing, assembly and administrative space on its existing site in Blum, Texas, which substantially increased DynaEnergetics' component manufacturing and DynaStage assembly capacity. In early 2019, the business commissioned a second automated shaped charge manufacturing line at Blum and plans to finish the installation of an additional automated shaped-charge line there in the second quarter of 2019, which will more than triple its shaped charge production capacity in the U.S. We refer to the new construction and manufacturing lines collectively as the “Blum expansion”. These investments expanded our global capacity for shaped charge and perforating gun production and improved our delivery and customer service capabilities in our key markets. 

Suppliers and Raw Materials
DynaEnergetics' product offering consists of complex components that require numerous high-end inputs. DynaEnergetics utilizes a variety of raw materials for the production of oilfield perforating and seismic products, including high-quality steel tubes, steel and copper, explosives, granulates, plastics and ancillary plastic product 
3

components. DynaEnergetics obtains its raw materials primarily from a number of different producers in Germany, other European countries, and the U.S. but also purchases materials from other international suppliers.
Competition
DynaEnergetics faces competition from independent manufacturers of perforating products and from the industry's three largest oil and gas service companies, which produce most of their own shaped charges but also buy other perforating components and specialty products from independent suppliers such as DynaEnergetics. DynaEnergetics competes for sales primarily on customer service, product quality, reliability, safety, performance, price and, in North America, its ability to provide customers with a factory-assembled perforating system, versus a series of components that must be assembled at a well site or nearby staging facility.
Customer Profile
DynaEnergetics' perforating and seismic products are purchased by international and regional oilfield service companies of all sizes working in both onshore and offshore oil and gas fields. Our customers select perforating products based on their leading performance, system compatibility and ability to address a broad spectrum of factors, including pressures and temperatures in the borehole and geological characteristics of the targeted formation.

The customers for our oilfield products can be divided into five broad categories: purchasing centers of large service companies, international service companies, independent international and North America-based service companies (often referred to as “wireline” companies), oil companies with and without their own service companies, and local resellers.  
Marketing, Sales, Distribution
DynaEnergetics’ worldwide marketing and sales efforts for its oilfield and seismic products are located in Troisdorf, Germany; Houston, Texas; and Tyumen, Siberia. DynaEnergetics’ sales strategy focuses on direct selling, distribution through licensed distributors and independent sales representatives, educating current and prospective service-company customers about our products and technologies, and educating E&Ps about the benefits of our products and technologies in an effort to generate pull-through demand. Currently, DynaEnergetics sells its oilfield and seismic products through wholly-owned affiliates in Germany, the U.S., Canada, and Russia and through independent sales agents in other parts of the world. DynaEnergetics serves the Americas region through its network of sales and distributions centers in the United States and Canada. 
DynaEnergetics also designs and manufactures customized perforating products for third-party customers according to their designs and requirements.
Research and Development
DynaEnergetics devotes substantial resources to its research and development (R&D) programs. Based predominantly in Troisdorf, Germany, the R&D team works closely with sales, product management, and operations management teams to establish priorities and effectively manage individual projects. Through its ongoing involvement in oil and gas industry trade shows and conferences, DynaEnergetics has increased its profile in the oil and gas industry. In addition to its existing shaped charge test facility, which can simulate downhole, wellbore, and reservoir pressure conditions to develop and test high performance perforating charges for both oil companies and service providers, the R&D group has a purpose-built pressure vessel which can reach 30,000 psi test pressures and be heated to up to 200 degrees Celsius (392 degrees F). This enables the R&D group to support the oil and gas industry with test methods for new products that realistically simulate potentially difficult downhole conditions. An R&D plan, which focuses on new technology, products, process support and contracted projects, is prepared and reviewed at least quarterly. R&D costs are included in our cost of products sold and were $5,932, $4,335, and $3,990 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
NobelClad
Clad metal plates are typically used in the construction of heavy, corrosion resistant pressure vessels and heat exchangers. Clad metal plates consist of a thin layer of an expensive, corrosion-resistant cladder metal, such as titanium or nickel alloy, which is metallurgically welded to a less expensive structural backing metal, such as carbon steel. For heavy equipment, clad plates generally provide an economical alternative to building the equipment solely of a corrosion-resistant alloy. While a significant portion of the demand for our clad metal products is driven by maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing, petrochemical processing, oil refining, and aluminum smelting facilities, new plant construction 
4

and large plant expansion projects also account for a significant portion of total demand. These industries tend to be cyclical in nature, and timing of new order inflow remains difficult to predict. 

There are three major industrial clad plate manufacturing technologies: explosion welding, hot roll bonding and weld overlay. Detaclad®, NobelClad’s process-controlled explosion clad, uses explosion welding, the most versatile of the clad plate manufacturing methods. Created using a robust cold-welding technology, explosion-welded clad products exhibit high bond strength and combine the corrosion resistance of the cladder material with the mechanical properties and structural strength of the lower cost backer material. The explosion welding process is suitable for joining virtually any combination of common engineered metals. This represents a competitive advantage versus the hot roll bonding and weld overlay processes, which generally can only clad compatible metals such as nickel alloys and stainless steel.
Explosion-welded clad metal is produced as flat plates or concentric cylinders, which can be further formed and fabricated into a broad range of industrial processing equipment or specialized transition joints. When fabricated properly, the two metals will not come apart, as the bond zone is generally stronger than the parent metals. The dimensional capabilities of the process are broad: cladding metal layers can range from a few thousandths of an inch to several inches in thickness and base metal thickness and lateral dimensions are primarily limited only by the capabilities of the world’s metal production mills. Explosion welding is used to clad to steel to a broad range of metals, including aluminum, titanium, zirconium, nickel alloys and stainless steels.

Clad Metal End-Use Markets

Explosion-welded clad metal is primarily used in the construction of large industrial processing equipment that is subject to high pressures and temperatures and/or corrosive processes. Explosion-welded clad plates also can be cut into transition joints, which are used to facilitate conventional welding of dissimilar metals. The eight broad industrial sectors discussed below comprise the bulk of demand for NobelClad’s products, with oil and gas and chemical and petrochemical constituting approximately two-thirds of NobelClad sales in 2018. This demand is driven by the underlying need for both new equipment and facility maintenance in these primary market sectors. 
Oil and Gas: Oil and gas end use markets include both oil and gas production and petroleum refining. Oil and gas production covers a broad scope of operations related to recovering oil and/or gas for subsequent processing in refineries. Clad metal is used in separators, glycol contractors, pipelines, heat exchangers and other related equipment. Increased oil and gas production from deep, hot, and more corrosive fields also has increased the demand for clad equipment. The primary clad metals for the oil and gas production market are stainless steel and nickel alloys clad to steel, with some use of reactive metals, such as titanium.
Petroleum refining processes frequently are corrosive and operate at high temperatures and pressures. Clad metal is extensively used in a broad range of equipment including desulfurization hydrotreaters, coke drums, distillation columns, separators and heat exchangers. Reliance upon low-quality, high-sulfur crude drives additional demand for new corrosion resistant equipment. Worldwide trends in regulatory control of sulfur emissions in gas, diesel and jet fuel are also increasing the need for clad equipment. Like the upstream oil and gas sector, the clad metals are primarily stainless steel and nickel alloys.
Chemical and Petrochemical: Many common products, ranging from plastics to prescription drugs to electronic materials, are produced by chemical processes. Because the production of these items often involves corrosive agents and is conducted under high pressures or temperatures, corrosion resistant equipment is needed. One of the larger applications for clad equipment is in the manufacture of purified terephthalic acid (PTA), a precursor product for polyester, which is used in products as diverse as carpets and plastic bottles. The chemical market requires extensive use of stainless steel and nickel alloys, but also uses titanium, zirconium and tantalum.
Alternative Energy: Some alternative energy technologies involve conditions that necessitate clad metals. Solar panels predominantly incorporate high purity polysilicon. Processes for manufacturing high purity silicon utilize a broad range of highly corrosion-resistant clad alloys. Many geothermal fields are corrosive, requiring high alloy clad separators to handle the hot steam. Some ethanol technologies may require corrosion resistant metals at thicknesses where clad is an attractive alternative.
Hydrometallurgy: The processes for production of nickel, gold, and copper involve acids, high pressures, and high temperatures, and titanium-clad plates are used extensively for construction of associated leaching and peripheral equipment.
Aluminum Production: Aluminum is reduced from its oxide in large electric smelters called potlines. The electric current is carried via aluminum conductors. The electricity must be transmitted into steel components for the high temperature smelting 
5

operations. Aluminum cannot be welded to steel conventionally. Explosion-welded aluminum-steel transition joints provide an energy efficient and highly durable solution for making these connections. Modern potlines use a large number of transition joints, which are typically replaced after approximately five years in service. Although aluminum production is the major electrochemical application for NobelClad products, there are a number of other electrochemical applications including production of zinc, magnesium, chlorine and chlorate.
Shipbuilding: The combined problems of corrosion and top-side weight drive demand for our aluminum-steel transition joints, which serve as the juncture between a ship's upper and lower structures. Top-side weight is often a significant problem with tall ships, including cruise ships, naval vessels, ferries and yachts. Use of aluminum in the upper structure and steel in the lower structure provides stability. Since aluminum cannot be welded directly to steel using conventional welding processes, and since bolted joints between aluminum and steel corrode quickly in seawater, explosion-welded transition joints are a common solution. NobelClad's transition joints have been used in the construction of many well-known ships, including the Queen Elizabeth II and modern U.S. Navy aircraft carriers.
Power Generation: Fossil fuel and nuclear power generation plants require extensive use of heat exchangers, many of which require corrosion resistant alloys to handle low quality cooling water. Our clad plates are used extensively for heat exchanger tubesheets. The largest clad tubesheets are used in the final low-pressure condensers. For most coastal and brackish water-cooled plants, titanium is the metal of choice, and titanium-clad tubesheets are the low-cost solution for power plant condensers.
Industrial Refrigeration: Heat exchangers are a core component of refrigeration systems. When the cooling fluid is seawater, brackish, or even slightly polluted, corrosion-resistant metals are necessary. Metal selection can range from stainless steel to copper alloy to titanium. Explosion-welded clad metal is often the low-cost solution for making the tubesheets. Applications range from refrigeration chillers on fishing boats to massive air conditioning units for skyscrapers, airports, and deep underground mines. 
Operations
The NobelClad segment seeks to build on its leadership position in its markets. During the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the NobelClad segment represented approximately 27%, 37% and 58% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. Our manufacturing plants and their respective shooting sites in Pennsylvania and Germany provide the production capacity to address projects for NobelClad’s global customer base. 
In December 2017, DMC approved a plan to consolidate NobelClad's European production facilities and it completed the process in the fourth quarter of 2018. NobelClad's state-of-the-art manufacturing center in Liebenscheid, Germany, purchased in November 2014, now performs all of NobelClad’s European explosion cladding, although the business maintains its sales and administrative office in France. 

The principal product of metal cladding, regardless of the process used, is a metal plate composed of two or more dissimilar metals, usually a corrosion resistant metal (the "cladder") bonded to a steel backing plate. Prior to the explosion-welding process, the materials are inspected, the mating surfaces are ground, and the metal plates are assembled for cladding. The process involves placing a sheet of the cladder over a parallel plate of backer material and then covering the cladder with a layer of specifically formulated explosive powder. A small gap or “standoff space” is maintained between the cladder and backer using small spacers. The explosion is then initiated on one side of the cladder and travels across the surface of the cladder forcing it onto the backer. The explosion happens in approximately one-thousandth of a second. The collision conditions cause a thin layer of the mating surfaces, as well as the spacers, to be spalled away in a jet. This action removes oxides and surface contaminants immediately ahead of the collision point. The extreme pressures force the two metal components together, creating a metallurgical bond between them. The explosion welding process produces a strong, ductile, continuous metallurgical weld over the clad surface. After the explosion is completed, the resulting clad plates are flattened and cut, and then undergo testing and inspection to assure conformance with product specifications.

EXPLOSION-WELDING PROCESS

Explosion-welded cladding technology is a method for welding metals that cannot be joined using conventional welding processes, such as titanium-steel, aluminum-steel, and aluminum-copper. Explosion welding also can be used to weld compatible metals, such as stainless steels and nickel alloys to steel. The cladding metals are typically titanium, stainless steel, aluminum, copper alloys, nickel alloys, tantalum, and zirconium. The base metals are typically carbon steel, alloy steel, stainless steel and aluminum. Although the patents for the basic explosion-welded cladding process have expired, NobelClad has developed a proprietary knowledge of process control that distinguishes it from its competitors by maintaining high quality and low re-work costs. The entire explosion-welding process involves significant precision in all stages, and any errors can be extremely costly as they often result in the discarding of the expensive raw material metals. NobelClad’s technological expertise is a significant advantage in preventing costly waste.
NobelClad’s metal products are primarily produced for custom projects and conform to requirements set forth in customers’ purchase orders. Upon receipt of an order, NobelClad obtains the component materials from a variety of sources based on quality, availability and cost and then produces the order in one of its manufacturing plants. Final products are processed to meet contract specific requirements for product configuration and quality/inspection level.
Suppliers and Raw Materials

NobelClad's operations involve a range of alloys, steels and other materials, such as stainless steel, copper alloys, nickel alloys, titanium, zirconium, tantalum, aluminum and other metals. NobelClad sources its raw materials from a number of different producers and suppliers. It holds a limited metal inventory and purchases its raw materials based on contract specifications. Under most contracts, any raw material price increases are passed on to NobelClad’s customers. NobelClad closely monitors the quality of its supplies and inspects the type, dimensions, markings, and certification of all incoming metals to ensure that the materials will satisfy applicable construction codes. NobelClad also manufactures a majority of its own explosives from standard raw materials, and we believe that this allows us to achieve higher quality and lower cost.
Competition

Metal Cladding.  NobelClad faces competition from two primary alternative cladding technologies: hot roll bonding and weld overlay. Usually the three processes do not compete directly, as each has its own preferential domain of application relating to metal used and thicknesses required. However, due to specific project considerations such as technical specifications, price and delivery time, explosion-welding may have the opportunity to compete against these technologies. Roll bond is only produced by a few steel mills in the world. In this process, the clad metal and base metal are 
7

bonded during the hot rolling operation in which the metal slab is converted to plate. Being a high temperature process that yields the formation of detrimental intermetallics, hot roll bond is limited to joining similar metals, such as stainless steel and nickel alloys to steel. Roll bond’s niche is production of large quantities of light to medium gauge clad plates. Roll bond products are generally suitable for most pressure vessel applications but have lower bond shear strength and may have inferior corrosion resistance. 
The weld overlay process, which is used by the many vessel fabricators that are often also NobelClad customers, is a slow and labor-intensive process that requires a large amount of floor space for the equipment. In weld overlay cladding, the clad metal layer is deposited on the base metal using arc-welding type processes. Weld overlay is a cost-effective technology for complicated shapes, for field service jobs, and for production of some very heavy-wall pressure vessel reactors. During overlay welding, the cladding metal and base metal are melted together at their interface. The resulting dilution of the cladding metal chemistry may compromise corrosion performance and limit use in certain applications. Weld metal shrinkage during cooling potentially causes distortion when the base layer is thin. As with rollbond, weld overlay is limited to metallurgically similar metals, primarily stainless steels and nickel alloys joined to steel. Weld overlay is typically performed in conventional metal fabrication shops.
Explosion-Welded Metal Cladding.  Competition in the explosion-welded clad metal business is fragmented. NobelClad holds a strong market position in the clad metal industry. It is the leading producer of explosion-welded clad products in North America, and has a strong position in Europe against smaller competitors. NobelClad has mixed competition in Asia ranging from competitors with competitive technology and strong brand names to other producers which are technically limited and offer minimal exports outside of their domestic markets. To remain competitive, NobelClad intends to continue developing and providing technologically advanced manufacturing services, maintaining quality levels, offering flexible delivery schedules, delivering finished products on a reliable basis and competing favorably on the basis of price.

Customer Profile

NobelClad’s products are used in critical applications in a variety of industries, including upstream oil and gas, oil refining, chemical and petrochemical, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, industrial refrigeration and other similar industries. NobelClad’s customers in these industries require metal products that can withstand exposure to corrosive materials, high temperatures and high pressures. NobelClad’s customers can be divided into three tiers: the product end users (e.g., operators of chemical processing plants), the engineering contractors that design and construct plants for end users, and the metal fabricators that manufacture the products or equipment that utilize NobelClad’s metal products. It is typically the fabricator that places the purchase order with NobelClad and pays the corresponding invoice. NobelClad has developed strong relationships over the years with the engineering contractors, process licensors, and equipment operating companies that frequently act as buying agents for fabricators.
Marketing, Sales, Distribution

NobelClad conducts its selling efforts by marketing its services to potential customers' senior management, direct sales personnel, program managers, and independent sales representatives. Prospective customers in specific industries are identified through networking in the industry, cooperative relationships with suppliers, public relations, customer references, inquiries from technical articles and seminars and trade shows. NobelClad’s sales office in the United States covers the Americas and Asia. Its sales offices in Europe cover the full European continent, Africa, the Middle East, India, Asia, and Russia. NobelClad also has sales offices in South Korea and China to address these markets and uses contract agents to cover various other countries. Contract agents typically work under multi-year agreements which are subject to sales performance targets as well as compliance with NobelClad quality and customer service expectations. Members of the global sales team may be called to work on projects located outside their usual territory. By maintaining relationships with its existing customers, developing new relationships with prospective customers, and educating all its customers as to the technical benefits of NobelClad’s products, NobelClad endeavors to assist in setting standard specifications, both by our customers and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and ASTM, to ensure that the highest quality and reliability are achieved.

NobelClad’s products are generally shipped from its manufacturing locations in the United States and Germany. Any shipping costs or duties for which NobelClad is responsible typically will be included in the price paid by the customer. Regardless of where the sale is booked, NobelClad will produce it, capacity permitting, at the location closest to the delivery place. In the event that there is a short-term capacity issue at one facility, NobelClad can produce the order at its other production site, prioritizing timing. The two production sites allow NobelClad to meet customer production needs in a timely manner.

Research and Development

We prepare a formal research and development plan annually. It is implemented at our cladding sites and is supervised by a technical committee that reviews progress quarterly and meets once a year to establish the plan for the following 12 months. The research and development projects concern process support, new products, new applications, and special customer-paid projects.
Corporate History and Recent Developments

The genesis of the Company was an unincorporated business called “Explosive Fabricators,” which was formed in Colorado in 1965. The business was incorporated in Colorado in 1971 under the name “E. F. Industries, Inc.,” which was later changed to “Explosive Fabricators, Inc.” The Company became publicly traded in 1976. In 1994, it changed its name to “Dynamic Materials Corporation.” The Company reincorporated in Delaware in 1997.

In 1976, the Company became a licensee of Detaclad, the explosion-welded clad process developed by DuPont in 1959. In 1996, the Company purchased the Detaclad operating business from DuPont.
In 1998, the Company acquired AMK Technical Services ("AMK"), a specialty welding business.
In 2001, the Company acquired substantially all of the stock of NobelClad Europe SA, a French company (“NobelClad Europe”). Early in its history, NobelClad Europe was a licensee of the Detaclad technology. The acquisition of NobelClad Europe expanded the Company’s explosive metalworking operations to Europe.

In 2007, the Company acquired the German company DynaEnergetics GmbH and Co. KG (“DynaEnergetics”) and certain affiliates. DynaEnergetics was comprised of two primary businesses: explosive metalworking and oilfield products. This acquisition expanded the Company’s explosive metalworking operations in Europe and added a complementary oilfield products business.

Over the next several years the Company further grew the DynaEnergetics business by acquiring additional related sales and manufacturing companies in Canada and the United States and purchasing minority interests in certain Russian joint ventures.

In 2013, the Company branded its explosive metalworking operations under the single name NobelClad. The NobelClad segment is comprised of the Company’s U.S. clad operations as well as the explosion metalworking assets and operations purchased in the NobelClad Europe and DynaEnergetics acquisitions. In 2014, the Company re-branded the oilfield products segment as DynaEnergetics, which is comprised entirely of DynaEnergetics (other than its explosion metalworking operations), its subsidiaries and sister companies.  
In 2014, the Company sold AMK. Also in 2014, the Company acquired a modern manufacturing and office complex in Liebenscheid, Germany. The facility enhances NobelClad's manufacturing capabilities and serves as a state-of-the-art production and administrative resource for NobelClad's European operations and also serves as a production resource for DynaEnergetics.
In 2016, the Company changed its name to DMC Global Inc. to reflect that we are a diversified portfolio of technical product and process businesses serving niche markets around the world.
In 2018, NobelClad completed the consolidation of its European explosion-welding operations into its manufacturing facility in Liebenscheid, Germany. DynaEnergetics expanded its North American operations, adding 74,000 square feet of manufacturing, assembly and administrative space on its Blum, Texas campus. 
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had 665 permanent and part-time employees (400 U.S. and 265 non-U.S.), the majority of whom are engaged in manufacturing operations, with the remainder primarily in sales, marketing and administrative functions. Most of our manufacturing employees are not unionized. In addition, we use a number of temporary workers at any given time, depending on the workload. We currently believe that employee relations are good. 
Insurance

9

Our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of a component that has been designed, manufactured, serviced, processed, or distributed by us. We maintain liability insurance that we believe adequately protects us from potential product liability claims.
Intellectual Property

We hold a variety of intellectual property through our DynaEnergetics business including but not limited to patents, patent applications, registered and unregistered trademarks, trade secrets, proprietary information and know-how. We have followed a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection in countries and regions throughout the world for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. DynaEnergetics seeks and holds numerous patents covering various products and processes, including but not limited to perforating guns and their various components, shaped charges, packaging of explosive materials, detonating cord, initiating systems and electronics.
We hold a variety of intellectual property through our NobelClad business, including but not limited to patent applications, proprietary information and know-how, trade secrets, and registered and unregistered trademarks. Much of our proprietary manufacturing expertise lies in the knowledge of the factors that affect the quality of the finished clad product, including the types of metals to be explosion-welded, the setting of the explosion, the composition of the explosive, and the preparation of the plates to be bonded. We have developed this specialized knowledge over our 40 years of experience in the explosive metalworking business.  
No single patent or trademark is considered to be critical to either DynaEnergetics' or NobelClad's businesses.
We are careful in protecting our proprietary know-how and manufacturing expertise in both DynaEnergetics and NobelClad, and we have implemented measures and procedures designed to ensure that the information remains confidential.
Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales

All of our sales are shipped from our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers located in the United States, Germany, France, Canada, and Russia. The following chart represents our net sales based on the geographic location to where we shipped the product, regardless of the country of the actual end user. NobelClad products are usually shipped to the fabricator before being passed on to the end user.
