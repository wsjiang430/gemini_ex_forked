Our Business
 
We are a biotechnology company that discovers novel, oral, small-molecule medicines. We focus on oral treatments for rare diseases in which significant unmet medical needs exist and an enzyme plays the key role in the biological pathway of the disease. We integrate the disciplines of biology, crystallography, medicinal chemistry and computer modeling to discover and develop small molecule pharmaceuticals through the process known as structure-guided drug design. Structure-guided drug design is a drug discovery approach by which we design synthetic compounds from detailed structural knowledge of the active sites of enzyme targets associated with particular diseases. We use X-ray crystallography, computer modeling of molecular structures and advanced chemistry techniques to focus on the three-dimensional molecular structure and active site characteristics of the enzymes that control cellular biology. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts for many vital biological reactions. Our goal generally is to design a compound that will fit in the active site of an enzyme and thereby prevent its catalytic activity. Molecules from our discovery efforts which are commercially available or that are in active development are summarized in the table below:

Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to create shareholder value by focusing our discovery and development efforts on oral drugs for rare diseases for which a significant unmet medical need exists. We select disease targets and product candidates in which a small molecule would offer a significant benefit over existing products or would be the first to market. We strive to advance our product candidate portfolio from discovery to commercial markets efficiently by utilizing a small group of talented and highly-skilled employees working in conjunction with strategic outsource partners. BioCryst is unique in its approach to treat orphan diseases with orally-administered, small molecules, identified by utilizing crystallography and structure-guided drug design. The principal elements of our strategy are: 

• | Focusing on High Value-Added Structure-Guided Drug Design Technologies. We utilize structure-guided drug design in order to most efficiently develop new therapeutic candidates. Structure-guided drug design is a process by which we design a product candidate through detailed analysis of the enzyme target, which the product candidate must inhibit in order to stop the progression of the disease or disorder. We believe that structure-guided drug design is a powerful tool for the efficient development of small-molecule product candidates that have the potential to be safe and effective. Our structure-guided drug design technologies typically allow us to design and synthesize multiple product candidates that inhibit the same enzyme target, with the goal of establishing broad patent protection and formulating compounds with competitive advantages.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selecting Inhibitors that are Promising Product Candidates. We start by selecting disease targets with well-understood biology and characteristics that fit with our ability to utilize structure-guided drug design capabilities to build potent and specific enzyme inhibitors. Next, we narrow our selection of these product candidates based on product characteristics, such as initial indications of safety and biologic activity on the target.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing our Product Candidates Efficiently. An important element of our business strategy is to efficiently progress our product candidates through the development process. In order to accomplish this, we typically strive for disease targets with a defined clinical and regulatory pathway for approval. In addition, we control fixed costs and overhead by outsourcing with strategic partners and contractors or entering into license agreements with third parties, including the U.S. Government. By contracting with the U.S. Government and outsourcing certain aspects of our operations, we are able to control overhead costs and focus financial resources directly where they provide the most benefit and reduce our business risk.

Peramivir injection (RAPIVAB®, ALPIVABTM, RAPIACTA®, PERAMIFLU®) 
 
Peramivir was approved in Japan and Korea in 2010, the United States in 2014, in Taiwan in 2016, in Canada in 2017, and in the European Union (“EU”) and Australia in 2018. It received approval under a pediatric Supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) in the United States in September 2017, extending its availability for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza to pediatric patients 2 years and older. In the United States, peramivir is indicated for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients who have been symptomatic for no more than two days. In May 2018, peramivir with the brand name of ALPIVAB received approval from the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), although ALPIVAB is not currently commercially available in the EU. Data from over 2,700 subjects treated with peramivir in 27 clinical trials was utilized to support original regulatory approval in these countries. We made RAPIVAB available for commercial sale in the U.S. through agreements with specialty distributorships during the 2014-2015 influenza season.

On June 17, 2015, we announced that we licensed RAPIVAB (peramivir injection) for the treatment of influenza to CSL Limited (“CSL”), a global biopharmaceutical company. Under this license agreement (the “SUL Agreement”), RAPIVAB and ALPIVAB are licensed to and expected to be commercialized by CSL's subsidiary, Seqirus UK Limited (“SUL”), which specializes in influenza prevention through the supply of seasonal and pandemic vaccine to global markets. SUL is to manufacture, commercialize and exercise decision-making authority with respect to the development and commercialization of RAPIVAB and ALPIVAB within the Territory (as defined in the SUL Agreement) and be responsible for all related costs, including sales and promotion.
 
Under the terms of the SUL Agreement, we are responsible for fulfilling all post-marketing approval commitments in connection with the FDA's approval of the new drug application (“NDA”), and upon fulfillment will transfer ownership of and financial responsibility for the NDA to SUL.
 
We are engaged in a formal dispute resolution process with SUL, which has now entered arbitration proceedings. The dispute involves many items under the SUL Agreement including, but not limited to, the EMA approval milestone and appropriately commercializing peramivir in the Territory.
 
In September 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention awarded us a $34.7 million contract for the procurement of up to 50,000 doses of RAPIVAB over a five-year period to supply the Strategic National Stockpile for use in a public health emergency. We expect to deliver at least one shipment within the award, totaling approximately $7.0 million, in 2019.
 
RAPIVAB was developed under a $234.8 million contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“BARDA/HHS”). See “Collaborations and In-License Relationships—BARDA/HHS” below for a further discussion of this development contract.
 
In January 2010, our partner Shionogi & Co., Ltd. (“Shionogi”) received the first approval for peramivir injection and launched it in Japan under the commercial name RAPIACTA. It is approved for the treatment of adults, children and infants with uncomplicated seasonal influenza and those patients at high-risk for complications associated with influenza. In August 2010, Green Cross Corporation (“Green Cross”) received marketing and manufacturing approval from the Korean Food & Drug Administration under the commercial name PERAMIFLU to treat patients with influenza A & B viruses, including pandemic H1N1 and avian influenza.
 
Hereditary Angioedema (“HAE”) Drug Candidates
 
HAE is a rare, severely debilitating and potentially fatal genetic condition that occurs in approximately 1 in 50,000 people. HAE symptoms include recurrent episodes of edema in various locations, including the hands, feet, face, genitalia and airway. Airway swelling is particularly dangerous and can lead to death by asphyxiation. In addition, patients often have bouts of severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting caused by swelling in the intestinal wall. By inhibiting plasma kallikrein, our HAE drug candidates suppress bradykinin production. Bradykinin is the mediator of acute swelling attacks in HAE patients.
 
BCX7353: BCX7353 is a second generation HAE compound and our lead molecule that is being developed as a once-daily (“QD”) oral therapy for the prevention of HAE attacks (prophylaxis), as well as an acute therapy for HAE attacks. We completed our Phase 2 prophylaxis program (with the completion of APeX-1 and subsequent FDA and EMA regulatory interactions) and in early 2018 initiated APeX-2 and APeX-S, a Phase 3 and a long-term safety clinical trial, respectively, required for marketing authorization in the United States and the EU. In addition, we have also initiated APeX-J in early 2019, a clinical trial designed to complete the requirements for Japanese marketing authorization, in conjunction with our other BCX7353 clinical trials, for the prevention of HAE attacks.
 
We are also developing BCX7353 as an oral treatment of acute HAE attacks. Accordingly, we have recently completed ZENITH-1, an adaptive dose-ranging proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating efficacy, safety and tolerability for the oral treatment of acute HAE attacks.
 
On August 6, 2018 we announced that Fast Track Designation was granted by the FDA for BCX7353 for the prevention of angioedema attacks in patients with HAE. In addition, in May 2018, we announced that the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency had granted a Promising Innovative Medicine designation to BCX7353. We have received orphan drug status from the FDA, EMA, and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PDMA”) for BCX7353.
 
On October 27, 2015 The Japanese Ministry of Health Labor & Welfare (“MHLW”) announced that BioCryst’s BCX7353 was one of six products designated under the MHLW’s Sakigake fast track review system. The Sakigake designation system promotes research and development in Japan, aiming at early market availability for innovative pharmaceutical products. This designation provides for additional interactions with the regulatory agency in Japan from early development through filing, prioritized development and review, and introduction of the product as soon as possible to address a serious unmet medical need.

APeX-1 Phase 2 Trial in HAE: On September 5, 2017, we announced final results from the Phase 2 APeX-1 clinical trial in HAE patients. The trial results were subsequently published in the New England Journal of Medicine (N Engl J Med 2018; 379:352-62). Seventy-five subjects were randomized and dosed and included in the final analysis of pooled data from Parts 1, 2 and 3: 7 at 62.5 mg, 14 at 125 mg, 14 at 250 mg and 18 at 350 mg of BCX7353 QD; and 22 placebo. The qualifying attack rate was approximately 1/week. Baseline characteristics were generally well balanced across the treatment groups. Compliance with daily study drug dosing for 28 days was excellent (≥ 98% across all treatment groups). Subjects recorded angioedema symptoms in a diary; diary records were reviewed and attacks adjudicated by an independent expert group. The primary endpoint of the trial was the rate of HAE attacks. The pre-specified per-protocol final analysis included data on a total of 67 subjects with Type I or Type II HAE completing > 90% of planned study drug doses.
 
The 125 mg dose level showed statistically significant and similar benefit for all attacks (reduction of attack rate by 74% (p < 0.001), per-protocol population, weeks 2-4). The 125 mg dose level also showed statistically significant and similar benefit when split into abdominal attacks and peripheral attacks. In contrast, at the 250 mg and 350 mg dose levels, there was no statistically significant effect for abdominal attacks, despite strong and statistically significant effects on peripheral attacks. Based on these findings, it is likely that subjects in the 250 mg and 350 mg arms recorded transient drug-related abdominal AEs as HAE attack symptoms in their diary. The lowest dose tested (62.5 mg QD) showed no statistically significant differences in attack rates (total, or when split into abdominal and peripheral) compared with placebo. The range of doses studied and associated results completed the dose response evaluation required to inform Phase 3 dose selection.
 
Oral BCX7353 once-daily for 28 days was generally safe and well tolerated in subjects with HAE. Overall, there was one serious adverse event of moderate gastrointestinal infection that was determined by the investigator not to be drug-related. Study drug was discontinued before day 28 in three subjects in the BCX7353 350 mg treatment arm (unrelated pre-existing liver disorder; related gastroenteritis with liver disorder; and related vomiting/abdominal cramps). The most common treatment-emergent AEs in descending order of frequency were the common cold, headache, diarrhea, nausea and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal AEs were infrequent at the 125 mg and 62.5 mg dose levels, and there were no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at these dose levels, though increases in liver enzymes were observed in several subjects at higher dose levels. Adverse events in the gastrointestinal system organ class were more frequent in the 350 mg QD and 250 mg QD dose groups compared to placebo. Elevated liver enzymes were reported in several subjects, and an analysis of liver enzyme safety tests including alanine aminotransferase (“ALT”) levels showed that of 4 subjects who had elevations of ALT to more than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal (“ULN”), all 4 had prior exposure to androgens, 3 were in the 350 mg QD group, 1 was in the 250 mg QD group, and 3 had baseline (prior to study drug administration) elevations in ALT of close to or greater than 3 times the ULN.
 
Steady state trough drug levels (24 hours after dosing) exceeded the proposed target threshold for efficacy in 0%, 57%, 100% and 100% of subjects at the 62.5 mg, 125 mg, 250 mg and 350 mg dose levels, respectively.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed regulatory interactions with the FDA and EMA and reached agreement on the Phase 3 program requirements to support NDA and MAA submissions for prophylactic treatment of HAE with BCX7353. Based upon this agreement, we began the APeX-S and APeX-2 clinical trials, which are the significant aspects of the remaining development program needed to receive commercial authorization in the United States and the EU. On March 25, 2018, we announced that we dosed the first patient in a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial studying two doses of BCX7353 (“APeX-2”). Patients in APeX-2 will roll-over into a 24 week safety extension. On February 28, 2018, we announced that we initiated a long-term safety trial (“APeX-S”), which will enroll approximately 160 patients who will be allocated to the two doses of BCX7353 included in APeX-2.
 
The doses studied in APeX-1 are expressed as the dihydrochloride salt of the drug. We changed the nomenclature after the Phase 2 APeX-1 trial to express the doses selected for evaluation in the APeX-2 trial in terms of the free base of the drug. Thus, a 125 mg dose in APeX-2 (dihydrochloride salt) is the same amount of active ingredient as the 110 mg dose in APeX-2, expressed as the free base. The 150 mg (free base) dose in APeX-2 was not studied in the Phase 2 APeX-1 trial.
 
APeX-2 Trial: APeX-2 is a Phase 3 double-blinded, placebo-controlled, three-arm clinical trial evaluating two dose levels of BCX7353 administered orally once-daily as a preventive treatment to reduce the frequency of attacks in patients with HAE. APeX-2 is testing once-daily BCX7353 at 110 mg and 150 mg for prevention of angioedema attacks. The trial enrolled patients with Type I and II HAE in the United States, Canada and Europe. The primary efficacy endpoint of APeX-2 is the rate of angioedema attacks over 24 weeks of study drug administration. On November 6, 2018, we announced we had completed enrollment in APeX-2 and had enrolled approximately 120 patients.
 
 APeX-S Trial: APeX-S is a long-term safety trial evaluating two dose levels of BCX7353 administered orally once-daily as a preventive treatment in patients with HAE. APeX-S is an open label two-arm trial to evaluate the safety of once-daily BCX7353 at 110 mg and 150 mg over 48 weeks in patients with Type I and II HAE. The trial will enroll at least 160 patients. On November 6, 2018, we announced we have met the 100 subjects needed at each dose level (cumulative, summing APeX-2 and APeX-S) for regulatory requirements and expect to file a NDA in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 
The APeX-2 and APeX-S trials have both recently been amended to extend the duration of dosing through 96 weeks.
 
ZENITH-1 Trial: On August 2, 2017, we announced the dosing of the first subject into ZENITH-1, a clinical trial studying three dose levels of a liquid formulation of BCX7353 given as a single oral dose for the acute treatment of angioedema attacks in patients with HAE. ZENITH-1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive dose-ranging trial of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of BCX7353 for treatment of acute angioedema attacks, and enrolled subjects with Type I and II HAE. Blinded study drug was dosed as an oral liquid after onset of symptoms, for up to 3 attacks in each subject, with each subject receiving both BCX7353 (for 2 attacks) and placebo (for one attack) in a randomized sequence. The trial was structured for three consecutive cohorts testing single doses of 750 mg, 500 mg and 250 mg.
 
On February 23, 2019, we reported topline data from the completed Phase 2 ZENITH-1 trial. Data from the complete trial confirmed previously-reported results showing a single dose of oral 750 mg BCX7353 was well-tolerated and superior to placebo (p<0.05) against the majority of efficacy endpoints evaluated in HAE patients suffering an acute attack, and demonstrated a clear dose response across the three dose levels evaluated, 250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg. With the 750 mg dose, compared to placebo, improvements in symptoms and Visual Analog Scale (“VAS”) scores were demonstrated as early as one hour after oral BCX7353 dosing (the first timepoint evaluated), and were sustained through 24 hours. Through 24 hours, standard of care (“SOC”) medication use was reduced by 31.6% after BCX7353 compared with placebo (p=0.0029), and no or mild symptoms were reported in 64.1% of attacks treated with BCX7353 compared with 32.3% of attacks treated with placebo (p=0.0038).
 
BCX7353 was generally safe and well-tolerated with no notable differentiation from the adverse event profile of placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events were diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, headache and nasopharyngitis. There were three discontinuations in the trial: one following a BCX7353 750 mg dose due to a transient, localized rash; one following a BCX7353 500 mg dose due to grade 2 vomiting and nausea and one following a placebo dose due to abdominal pain. With the exception of an unrelated ankle fracture, there were no grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and no grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities. 


We met with EU National Agencies in the first quarter of 2019. Based on the results of ZENITH-1, we plan to meet with the FDA in the second quarter, and to commence a Phase 3 trial with the 750 mg dose of oral BCX7353 in the summer of 2019.

Complement-Mediated Diseases 
 
The complement system is part of the body’s natural immune system and is responsible for helping the body eliminate microbes (including viral and bacterial infections) and damaged cells. It is comprised of proteins which are primarily produced in the liver and circulate in the blood. Once activated, the complement system stimulates inflammation, phagocytosis and cell lysis. Excessive or uncontrolled activation of the complement system can cause severe, and potentially fatal, immune and inflammatory disorders. The complement system comprises biological cascades of amplifying enzyme cleavages involving more than 30 proteins and protein fragments, and may be activated through three pathways: the classical pathway (initiated by antibody-antigen complexes), the lectin pathway (initiated by lectin binding) and the alternative pathway (initiated by microbial surfaces). The alternative pathway also provides a critical amplification loop for all three pathways, regardless of the initiating mechanism. Factor D is an essential enzyme in the alternative pathway, thus making Factor D an attractive target to address complement-mediated diseases. Several rare diseases are known to be mediated by dysregulation of the complement system.
 
We are in the process advancing BCX9930, an oral Factor D inhibitor discovered and developed by BioCryst, into Phase 1 clinical development in the second quarter of 2019 for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases. We are completing clinical drug manufacturing to support Phase 1 trials beginning in the second quarter of 2019.
 
Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (“FOP”) Drug Candidates
 
FOP is a very rare disease that affects approximately 1 in 2 million people worldwide. FOP is a rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (“HO”). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. FOP patients progressively become bound by this irregular ossification, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. In patients with FOP, minor trauma can result in rapid development of painful inflammatory masses. These progress over several weeks resulting in the replacement of the affected soft tissue by permanent bone masses. There is no cure for this condition, and there are no approved treatments for FOP.
 
On January 5, 2018, we announced the advancement of a program exploring activin receptor-like kinase-2 (“ALK2”) inhibitors for treatment of FOP. ALK2 enzyme is a part of the normal signaling pathway for bone formation and responds to binding its specific ligands (bone morphogenic proteins, or BMPs), by stimulating normal bone growth and renewal in healthy children and adults. Specific activating mutations of the ALK2 gene are seen in all cases of FOP. An activating mutation in ALK2 is necessary for the disease to occur, making the ALK2 kinase an ideal drug target for treatment of FOP with an ALK2 kinase inhibitor. We plan to submit an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for one of our optimized lead candidates, BCX9250, in the second half of 2019. BCX9250 was selected from a number of potential candidates based on potency for the target kinase, selectivity, nonclinical PK, safety screening studies, and nonclinical safety evaluations. GLP-compliant nonclinical safety pharmacology and toxicology studies required for initiation of clinical studies have been completed. We are completing clinical drug manufacturing to support Phase 1 trials beginning in the second half of 2019, and clinical trials in patients with FOP in 2020.
 
The goal of the ALK2 inhibitor project at BioCryst is to discover and develop orally administered kinase inhibitor drug candidates that are able to slow or prevent the progressive formation of bone in soft tissues, also known as heterotopic ossification (“HO”). BCX9250 reduced HO in an experimental model of ALK2-driven HO in laboratory rats, with up to 89 percent reduction in volume of HO compared to controls.
 
Galidesivir (formerly BCX4430)
 
Galidesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral (“BSAV”) research program and is currently being developed under contracts with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIAID/HHS”) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“BARDA/HHS”). The objective of our BSAV program is to develop galidesivir as a broad-spectrum therapeutic for viruses that pose a threat to national health and security. The primary focus of the program is treatment of hemorrhagic fever viruses. NIAID/HHS funding has supported galidesivir’s development as a treatment for Marburg virus, Yellow Fever and Ebola virus. Galidesivir has been shown to be active against more than 20 RNA viruses in nine different families, including filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and flaviviruses. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Marburg, Yellow Fever, Ebola, and Zika viruses and from exposures to aerosolized Marburg virus, an experimental condition designed to mimic an exposure scenario that could result during a bioterrorist attack.
 
On December 15, 2014, we announced the dosing of the first subject in a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate i.m. administration of galidesivir in healthy volunteers. The main goals of this first-in-human study were to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of galidesivir administered via i.m. injection in healthy subjects. In part one of the study, subjects received a single dose of galidesivir; in part two of the study, subjects received galidesivir for seven days. There were six single-dose cohorts and four multiple-dose cohorts evaluated, and 91 healthy volunteers participated. In August 2016, we reported the results of this study. Galidesivir administered by i.m. injection was generally safe and well tolerated over the range of doses up to 10 mg/kg, and durations tested (up to 7 days). Fifty subjects received doses of study drug and there were no serious or severe adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse event across all cohorts was injection site pain and there were no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities which occurred at any doses. In addition, co-administration of lidocaine with galidesivir was determined to ameliorate injection site pain without altering the plasma pharmacokinetics profile of galidesivir. From this clinical trial, we determined galidesivir was safe and well tolerated, and that exposure was dose-proportional and supported the continued development of this BSAV drug candidate for serious emerging viral infections.

On September 17, 2018, we announced that NIAID/HHS had awarded us an additional $3.5 million under our existing contract to support and conduct clinical trials of galidesivir in patients with Yellow Fever. We are in the process of initiating an exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating galidesivir in Yellow Fever patients in Brazil, with the trial expected to begin in 2019. As of December 31, 2018, the total NIAID/HHS contract amount is $43.0 million. The galidesivir BARDA/HHS contract has a potential value of $39.1 million if all contract options are exercised. As of December 31, 2018, a total of $20.6 million has been awarded under exercised options within this contract.
 
On January 2, 2019, we announced the dosing of the first subject in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate intravenous galidesivir in healthy volunteers. The main goals of this trial are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of escalating intravenous doses of galidesivir in healthy subjects. Up to four single-dose cohorts will be evaluated with a total of up to 32 volunteers participating.
 
Mundesine (forodesine)
 
Mundesine is a Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase (“PNP”) inhibitor developed by Mundipharma as a treatment for cancer under a world-wide license agreement. PNP is a purine salvage pathway enzyme. High doses of PNP inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of hematological malignancies. Mundipharma has received orphan drug status for Mundesine, and following its successful completion of a Phase 2 pivotal study in recurrent/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (“PTCL”) patients in Japan, Mundesine was approved in April 2017 by the MHLW in Japan. We are currently receiving royalties on Mundesine. 
 
Collaborations and In-License Relationships
 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“BARDA/HHS”). In January 2007, BARDA/HHS awarded us a contract for the advanced development of peramivir for the treatment of influenza. This contract was amended multiple times and ultimately became a $234.8 million contract award that provided funding to support the filing of an NDA to seek regulatory approval for peramivir in the U.S. In December 2014, the FDA approved the NDA. The BARDA/HHS contract expired on June 30, 2014 according to its terms.
 
On March 31, 2015, we announced that BARDA/HHS awarded us a contract for the continued development of galidesivir as a potential treatment for diseases caused by RNA pathogens, including filoviruses. This BARDA/HHS contract has a potential value of $39.1 million if all contract options are exercised. As of December 31, 2018, a total of $20.6 million has been awarded under exercised options within this contract.
 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIAID/HHS”). In September 2013, NIAID/HHS contracted with us for the development of galidesivir as a treatment for Marburg, and subsequently, Yellow Fever and Ebola virus disease. NIAID/HHS, part of the National Institutes of Health, made an initial award of $5.0 million to us. All options under this contract have been awarded and the total contract value is $43.0 million. The goals of this contract, including amendments, are to file IND applications for i.v. and i.m. galidesivir for the treatment of Marburg virus disease and other hemorrhagic fever viruses, to study galidesivir as a treatment for Yellow Fever and Ebola virus disease, and to conduct Phase 1 human clinical trials.
 
The contracts with BARDA/HHS and NIAID/HHS are cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. That is, we are entitled to receive reimbursement for all costs incurred in accordance with the contracts provisions that are related to the development of peramivir and galidesivir plus a fixed fee, or profit. BARDA/HHS and NIAID/HHS will make periodic assessments of progress and the continuation of the contract is based on our performance, the timeliness and quality of deliverables, and other factors. The government has rights under certain contract clauses to terminate these contracts. These contracts are also terminable by the government at any time for breach or without cause.
 
Seqirus UK Limited. On June 16, 2015, we and SUL, a limited company organized under the laws of the United Kingdom and a subsidiary of CSL, a company organized under the laws of Australia, entered into the SUL Agreement granting SUL and its affiliates worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize peramivir for the treatment of influenza except for the rights to conduct such activities in Israel, Japan, Korea and Taiwan (the permitted geographies together constituting the “Territory”). We retain all rights and associated economics to procure pandemic stockpiling orders for RAPIVAB from the U.S. Government, while SUL has the right to pursue government stockpiling outside the U.S.

Pursuant to the SUL Agreement, peramivir is being commercialized by CSL’s subsidiary, SUL, which specializes in influenza prevention through the supply of seasonal and pandemic vaccine to global markets. SUL is responsible for the manufacture, commercialization and decision-making authority with respect to the development and commercialization of peramivir within the Territory and is responsible for all related costs, including sales and promotion. We exercise sole decision-making authority with regard to the development and commercialization of peramivir outside of the Territory and are responsible for all associated costs. 
 
Under the terms of the SUL Agreement, we are responsible for fulfilling all post-marketing approval commitments in connection with the FDA’s approval of the NDA, and upon fulfillment will transfer ownership of and financial responsibility for the NDA to SUL. Pursuant to rights to sell ALPIVAB in the EU, we were responsible for regulatory filings and interactions with the European Medicines Agency. In accordance with the SUL Agreement, we and SUL formed a joint steering committee, composed of an equal number of representatives from each party, to oversee, review and coordinate the conduct and progress of the commercialization of peramivir in the Territory and any additional development. The parties have entered into the formal dispute resolution process under the SUL Agreement to resolve decisions related to the collaboration. We and SUL are engaged in a formal dispute resolution process, which has now entered arbitration proceedings. The dispute involves many items under the SUL Agreement including, but not limited to, the EMA approval milestone, which we maintain is due under the contract as well as appropriately commercializing peramivir in the Territory. Arbitration proceedings, like other legal proceedings, are inherently uncertain. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will prevail in the arbitration.
 
Under the terms of the SUL Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $33.7 million, and have achieved all development milestones under the contract totaling $12.0 million. We are also entitled under the SUL Agreement to receive tiered royalties at a percentage rate beginning in the mid-teens contingent upon meeting minimum thresholds of net sales, as well as a low-thirties percentage of the gross profit from government stockpiling purchases made outside the U.S. Specifically, we receive tiered royalties at a percentage rate in the mid-teens to low-forties on net sales in the U.S. during a Contract Year (defined as July 1 - June 30) and tiered royalties at a percentage rate in the mid-teens to mid-twenties on net sales in the Territory, other than in the U.S., during a Calendar Year, each subject to certain downward adjustments for circumstance or events impacting the overall market opportunity. SUL’s royalty payment obligations commence on the date of the SUL Agreement and expire, on a country-by-country basis, upon the later of (i) the expiration of legal exclusivity in such country and (ii) ten years from the date of the SUL Agreement (the “Royalty Term”). We developed RAPIVAB under a license from UAB and will owe sublicense payments to them on any future milestone payments and/or royalties received by us from SUL.
 
The term of the SUL Agreement shall continue on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire Royalty Term in any such country in the Territory. Either party may terminate the SUL Agreement in its entirety if the other party breaches a payment obligation, otherwise materially breaches the SUL Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods, or if the other party suffers an insolvency event. We may also terminate the SUL Agreement if SUL or any of its affiliates seek to challenge the validity of our patents. Termination does not affect a party’s rights which have accrued prior thereto, but there are no stated payments in connection with termination other than payments of obligations previously accrued. For all terminations exercised by us, the SUL Agreement provides for the termination of any sublicenses granted by SUL to third parties, and in the case of termination by us for cause, the ceasing of SUL’s activities with respect to RAPIVAB, the discontinued use of all of our intellectual property and the termination of licenses and rights previously granted to SUL. If requested by us, SUL shall also promptly sell to us all licensed product it then holds in stock, otherwise, SUL may continue to sell such licensed product for designated periods.
 
Shionogi & Co., Ltd. (“Shionogi”). On February 28, 2007, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Shionogi Agreement”), an exclusive license agreement with Shionogi to develop and commercialize peramivir in Japan for the treatment of seasonal and potentially life-threatening human influenza. In October 2008, we and Shionogi amended the Shionogi Agreement to expand the territory covered by the agreement to include Taiwan. Under the terms of the Shionogi Agreement, Shionogi obtained rights to injectable formulations of peramivir in Japan in exchange for a $14.0 million upfront payment. The license provided for development milestone payments (up to $21.0 million), which have all been paid, and for commercial milestone payments (up to $95.0 million) in addition to double-digit (between 10% and 20%) royalty payments on product sales of peramivir.
 
In December 2017, we, on behalf of Royalty Sub (defined below), instituted arbitration proceedings against Shionogi in order to resolve a dispute with Shionogi under the Shionogi Agreement regarding the achievement of sales milestones and escalating royalties. In the event that we prevail in the arbitration, any amounts realized in the arbitration or in respect of the milestone payments and escalating royalties that are the subject of the arbitration would be for the benefit of Royalty Sub and be used by Royalty Sub to service its obligations under the non-recourse PhaRMA Notes (defined below), except for any amounts realized by us in respect of royalties relating to sales to Japanese governmental entities, which amounts would be retained by us. The costs associated with the arbitration proceedings are expected to be paid out of the assets of Royalty Sub in accordance with the terms of the indenture and servicing agreement relating to the PhaRMA Notes, except to the extent such costs are recovered in connection with any arbitration award in favor of us and Royalty Sub if we prevail in the arbitration proceedings. Arbitration proceedings, like other legal proceedings, are inherently uncertain. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will prevail in the arbitration. As any arbitration award in favor of us would accrue primarily to the benefit of Royalty Sub and the holders of the PhaRMA Notes, and because the costs associated with the arbitration proceedings are expected to come out of the assets of Royalty Sub if not recovered as part of any arbitration award in favor of us and Royalty Sub, we do not currently anticipate that these arbitration proceedings will have a material adverse impact on us.

Generally, all payments under the Shionogi Agreement are non-refundable and non-creditable, but they are subject to audit. Shionogi is responsible for all development, regulatory, and marketing costs in Japan. The term of the Shionogi Agreement is from February 28, 2007 until terminated. Either party may terminate in the event of an uncured breach. Shionogi has the right of termination without cause. In the event of termination, all license and rights granted to Shionogi shall terminate and shall revert back to us. We developed peramivir under a license from the University of Alabama Birmingham (“UAB”) and have paid sublicense payments to UAB on the upfront payments and will owe sublicense payments on any future event payments and/or royalties received by us from Shionogi.
 
Shionogi Royalty Monetization and Non-Recourse Notes Payable. On March 9, 2011, we completed a $30.0 million financing transaction to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments under the Shionogi Agreement, pursuant to which JPR Royalty Sub LLC (“Royalty Sub”) a wholly-owned subsidiary of BioCryst, issued the PhaRMA Notes discussed below. We received net proceeds of $22.7 million from this transaction.
 
As part of the transaction, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement dated as of March 9, 2011 with Royalty Sub, whereby we transferred to Royalty Sub, among other things, (i) its rights to receive commercial royalty and milestone payments from Shionogi arising under the Shionogi Agreement, and (ii) the right to receive payments under a Japanese yen/US dollar foreign currency hedge arrangement (as further described below, the “Currency Hedge Agreement”) put into place by us in connection with the transaction. Royalty payments will be paid by Shionogi in Japanese yen and milestone payments will be paid in U.S. dollars. Our collaboration with Shionogi was not impacted by this transaction.
 
On March 9, 2011, Royalty Sub completed a private placement to institutional investors of $30.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its PhaRMA Senior Secured 14.0% Notes due 2020 (the “PhaRMA Notes”). The PhaRMA Notes were issued by Royalty Sub under an Indenture, dated as of March 9, 2011 (the “Indenture”), by and between Royalty Sub and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee. Principal and interest on the PhaRMA Notes issued are payable from, and are secured by, the rights to royalty and milestone payments under the Shionogi Agreement transferred by us to Royalty Sub and payments, if any, made to Royalty Sub under the Currency Hedge Agreement. The PhaRMA Notes bear interest at 14.0% per annum, payable annually in arrears on September 1st of each year (the “Payment Date”). We remain entitled to receive any royalties and milestone payments related to sales of peramivir by Shionogi following repayment by Royalty Sub of the PhaRMA Notes.
 
Royalty Sub’s obligations to pay principal and interest on the PhaRMA Notes are obligations solely of Royalty Sub and are without recourse to any other person, including the Company, except to the extent of our pledge of its equity interests in Royalty Sub in support of the PhaRMA Notes. We may, but are not obligated to, make capital contributions to a capital account that may be used to redeem, or on up to one occasion pay any interest shortfall on, the PhaRMA Notes. 
 
In September 2014, Royalty Sub was unable to pay the full amount of interest payable in September 2013 by the next succeeding Payment Date for the PhaRMA Notes, which was September 1, 2014. This inability constituted an event of default under the terms of the Indenture. Accordingly, we have classified the PhaRMA Notes and related accrued interest as current liabilities on our balance sheet. As a result of the event of default under the PhaRMA Notes, the holders of the PhaRMA Notes may pursue acceleration of the PhaRMA Notes, may foreclose on the collateral securing the PhaRMA Notes and the equity interest in Royalty Sub and exercise other remedies available to them under the Indenture in respect of the PhaRMA Notes. In such event, we may not realize the benefit of future royalty payments that might otherwise accrue to us following repayment of the PhaRMA Notes and we might otherwise be adversely affected. Due to the non-recourse nature of the PhaRMA Notes, in the event of any potential acceleration or foreclosure, we believe the primary impact to us would be the loss of future royalty payments from Shionogi and legal costs associated with retiring the PhaRMA Notes. In addition, we may incur costs associated with liquidating the related Currency Hedge Agreement, which would no longer be required in the event of foreclosure or if the PhaRMA Notes cease to be outstanding. As the PhaRMA Notes are the obligation of Royalty Sub, we do not currently expect the event of default on the PhaRMA Notes to have a significant impact on our future results of operations or cash flows. As of December 31, 2018, the PhaRMA Notes remain in default.
 
The Indenture does not contain any financial covenants. The Indenture includes customary representations and warranties of Royalty Sub, affirmative and negative covenants of Royalty Sub, Events of Default and related remedies, and provisions regarding the duties of the Trustee, indemnification of the Trustee, and other matters typical for indentures used in structured financings of this type. The PhaRMA Notes are redeemable at the option of Royalty Sub at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal balance of the PhaRMA Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date on the PhaRMA Notes being redeemed.
 
Foreign Currency Hedge. In connection with the issuance by Royalty Sub of the PhaRMA Notes, we entered into a Currency Hedge Agreement to hedge certain risks associated with changes in the value of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar. Under the Currency Hedge Agreement, we have the right to purchase dollars and sell yen at a rate of 100 yen per dollar for which we may be required to pay a premium in each year from 2019 through 2020. A payment of $2.0 million will be required if, on May 18 of the relevant year, the U.S. dollar is worth 100 yen or less, as determined in accordance with the Currency Hedge Agreement.

The Currency Hedge Agreement does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, mark-to-market adjustments are recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. Cumulative mark-to-market adjustments resulted in losses of $1.0 million, $1.8 million and $1.7 million for the twelve months ended December 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. In addition, realized currency exchange gains of $1.0 million, $1.0 million and $0.8 million were recognized in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the exercise of a U.S. dollar/Japanese yen currency option under our foreign currency hedge. We are also required to post collateral in connection with the mark-to-market adjustments based on defined thresholds. As of December 31, 2018, no collateral was posted under the Currency Hedge Agreement. We will not be required at any time to post collateral exceeding the maximum premium payments remaining payable under the Currency Hedge Agreement. The maximum amount of hedge collateral we would be required to post is $3.9 million. We are required to maintain a foreign currency hedge at 100 yen per dollar under the agreements governing the PhaRMA Notes.
 
Green Cross. In June 2006, we entered into an agreement with Green Cross to develop and commercialize peramivir in Korea. Under the terms of the agreement, Green Cross is responsible for all development, regulatory, and commercialization costs in Korea. We received a one-time license fee of $250,000. The license provides that we will share in profits resulting from the sale of peramivir in Korea, including the sale of peramivir to the Korean government for stockpiling purposes. Furthermore, Green Cross will pay us a premium over its cost to supply peramivir for development and any future marketing of peramivir products in Korea. Both parties have the right to terminate in the event of an uncured material breach. In the event of termination, all rights, data, materials, products and other information would be transferred to us.
 
In August 2010, we announced that Green Cross had received marketing and manufacturing approval from the Korean Food & Drug Administration for i.v. peramivir, under the commercial name PERAMIFLU®. PERAMIFLU is intended to treat patients with influenza A & B viruses, including pandemic H1N1 and avian influenza. Green Cross received the indication of single dose administration of 300 mg i.v. peramivir.
 
Other Peramivir Collaborations. In addition to our collaborations with Shionogi and Green Cross, in March 2011 we entered into an arrangement with Neopharm Scientific Limited, granting certain commercial and distribution rights for peramivir in Israel.
Mundipharma. In February 2006, we entered into an exclusive, royalty bearing right and license agreement with Mundipharma for the development and commercialization of Mundesine, a PNP inhibitor, for use in oncology (the “Original Agreement”). Under the terms of the Original Agreement, Mundipharma obtained rights to Mundesine in markets across Europe, Asia, and Australasia in exchange for a $10.0 million up-front payment. In addition, Mundipharma contributed $10.0 million of the documented out-of-pocket development costs incurred by us in respect of the current and planned trials as of the effective date of the agreement, and Mundipharma would conduct additional clinical trials at their own cost up to a maximum of $15.0 million.
 
On November 11, 2011, we entered into the Amended and Restated Agreement with Mundipharma (the “Amended and Restated Agreement”). Under the terms of this Amended and Restated Agreement, Mundipharma obtained worldwide rights to Mundesine in the field of oncology. Mundipharma will control the development and commercialization of Mundesine and assume all future development and commercialization costs. The Amended and Restated Agreement provides for the possibility of future event payments totaling $15.0 million for achieving specified regulatory events for certain indications. In addition, the Amended and Restated Agreement provides that we will receive tiered royalties ranging from mid- to high-single digit percentages of net product sales in each country where Mundesine is sold by Mundipharma. These royalties are subject to downward adjustments based on the then-existing patent coverage and/or the availability of generic compounds in each country. Generally, all payments under the Amended and Restated Agreement are nonrefundable and non-creditable, but they are subject to audit. We licensed forodesine and other PNP inhibitors from AECOM/IRL and will owe sublicense payments to AECOM/IRL on all milestone payments and royalties received by us from Mundipharma.
 
Mundipharma will also have a right of exclusive negotiations with us for a limited period of time if they initiate negotiations for a specified backup PNP inhibitor. Otherwise, they will be able to participate in the same negotiations process we enter into with another company for the backup PNP inhibitor. The Amended and Restated Agreement will continue for the commercial life of the licensed products, but may be terminated by either party following an uncured material breach by the other party or in the event the pre-existing third party license with AECOM/IRL expires. It may be terminated by Mundipharma upon 60 days written notice without cause or under certain other conditions as specified in the Amended and Restated Agreement. If Mundipharma terminates the Amended and Restated Agreement, Mundipharma would no longer have any rights in Mundesine and the rights would revert back to us; provided, however, that in the event the we determine to subsequently use the data developed under the Amended and Restated Agreement for development and commercialization of Mundesine in the field of oncology, then we would have to pay Mundipharma 150% of the cost of such data for such use.

Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University and Industrial Research, Ltd. (“AECOM” and “IRL” respectively). In June 2000, we licensed a series of potent inhibitors of PNP from AECOM and IRL, (collectively, the “Licensors”). The lead product candidate from this collaboration is forodesine. We have obtained worldwide exclusive rights to develop and ultimately distribute it, or any other, product candidates that might arise from research on these inhibitors. We have the option to expand our license agreement with the Licensors to include other inventions in the field made by the investigators or employees of the Licensors. We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop these drugs. In addition, we have agreed to pay certain milestone payments for each licensed product (which range in the aggregate from $1.4 million to almost $4.0 million per indication) for future development of these inhibitors, single digit royalties on net sales of any resulting product made by us, and to share approximately one quarter of future payments received from other third-party partners, if any. In addition, we have agreed to pay annual license fees, which can range from $150,000 to $500,000, that are creditable against actual royalties and other payments due to the Licensors. This agreement may be terminated by us at any time by giving 60 days advance notice or in the event of material uncured breach by the Licensors.
 
In May 2010, we amended the license agreement through which we obtained worldwide exclusive rights to develop and ultimately distribute any product candidates that might arise from research on a series of PNP inhibitors, including forodesine. Under the terms of the amendment, the Licensors agreed to accept a reduction of one-half in the percentage of future payments received from third-party sub licensees of the licensed PNP inhibitors that must be paid to the Licensors. This reduction does not apply to (i) any milestone payments we may receive in the future under our license agreement with Mundipharma and (ii) royalties received from its sub licensees in connection with the sale of licensed products, for which the original payment rate will remain in effect. The rate of royalty payments to the Licensors based on net sales of any resulting product made by us remains unchanged. At our sole option and subject to certain agreed upon conditions, any future non-royalty payments due to be paid by us to the Licensors under the license agreement may be made either in cash, in shares of our common stock, or in a combination of cash and shares. 
 
On November 17, 2011, we further amended our agreements with the Licensors whereby the Licensors agreed to accept a reduction of one-half in the percentage of Net Proceeds (as defined in the license agreement) received by us under our Amended and Restated Agreement with Mundipharma that will be paid to AECOM/IRL. 
 
On June 19, 2012, we further amended our agreements with the Licensors whereby the parties clarified the definition of the field with respect to PNP inhibition and the Licensors agreed to grant an exclusive worldwide license of galidesivir to us for any antiviral use. 
 
The University of Alabama at Birmingham (“UAB”). We currently have agreements with UAB for influenza neuraminidase and complement inhibitors. Under the terms of these agreements, UAB performed specific research for us in return for research payments and license fees. UAB has granted us certain rights to any discoveries in these areas resulting from research developed by UAB or jointly developed with us. We have agreed to pay single digit royalties on sales of any resulting product and to share in future payments received from other third-party partners. We have completed the research under the UAB agreements. These two agreements have initial 25-year terms, are automatically renewable for five-year terms throughout the life of the last patent and are terminable by us upon three months’ notice and by UAB under certain circumstances. Upon termination both parties shall cease using the other parties’ proprietary and confidential information and materials, the parties shall jointly own joint inventions and UAB shall resume full ownership of all UAB licensed products. There is currently no activity between us and UAB on these agreements, but when we license this technology, such as in the case of the Shionogi and Green Cross agreements, or commercialize products related to these programs, we will owe sublicense fees or royalties on amounts it receives.
 
Government Contracts
 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIAID/HHS”). In September 2013, NIAID/HHS contracted with us for the development of galidesivir as a treatment for Marburg, and subsequently, Yellow Fever and Ebola virus. NIAID/HHS, part of the National Institutes of Health, made an initial award of $5.0 million to us. All options under this contract have been awarded and the total contract value is $43.0 million. The goals of this contract, including amendments, are to file IND applications for i.v. and i.m. galidesivir for the treatment of Marburg virus disease and other hemorrhagic fever viruses, to study galidesivir as a treatment for Yellow Fever and Ebola virus disease and to conduct a Phase 1 human clinical trial.
 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“BARDA/HHS”). On March 31, 2015, we announced that BARDA/HHS awarded us a contract for the continued development of galidesivir as a potential treatment for diseases caused by RNA pathogens, including filoviruses. This BARDA/HHS contract has a potential value of $39.1 million if all contract options are exercised. As of December 31, 2018, a total of $20.6 million has been awarded under exercised options within this contract.
 
The contracts with NIAID/HHS and BARDA/HHS are cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. That is, we are entitled to receive reimbursement for all costs incurred in accordance with the contracts provisions that are related to the development of peramivir and galidesivir plus a fixed fee, or profit. NIAID/HHS and BARDA/HHS will make periodic assessments of progress and the continuation of the contract is based on our performance, the timeliness and quality of deliverables, and other factors. The government has rights under certain contract clauses to terminate these contracts. These contracts are also terminable by the government at any time for breach or without cause.

Patents and Proprietary Information
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. We own or have rights to certain proprietary information, proprietary technology, issued and allowed patents and patent applications which relate to compounds we are developing. We actively seek, when appropriate, protection for our products, proprietary technology and proprietary information by means of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and contractual arrangements. In addition, we rely upon trade secrets and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information, proprietary technology and products.
 
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages against competitors with similar compounds or technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates or those developed by our partners can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we have been issued approximately 17 U.S. patents that expire between 2019 and 2035 and that relate to our HAE program compounds, neuraminidase inhibitor compounds, BSAV compounds and PNP compounds. We have licensed a number of compounds protected by certain composition of matter patents from AECOM and IRL, plus additional manufacturing patents, totaling 7 additional U.S. patents that expire between 2020 and 2029. Additionally, we have approximately 13 Patent Cooperation Treaty or U.S. patent applications pending related to HAE program compounds, neuraminidase inhibitor compounds, BSAV compounds, PNP compounds, FOP program compounds, and other rare disease program compounds. Our pending applications may not result in issued patents, our patents may not cover the products of interest or may not be enforceable in all, or any jurisdictions and our patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially viable. After expiration of composition of matter patents for our products and product candidates, we may rely on data exclusivity, or in some cases, method of use patents. The enforceability of these patents varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may not be allowed or enforceable in some territories where we may seek approval. We may not have the funds to continue patent prosecution or to defend all of our existing patents in our current patent estate and may selectively abandon patents or patent families worldwide or in certain territories.
 
Our success is also dependent upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, none of which is patentable. To help protect our rights, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements, which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of BioCryst and, where possible, require disclosure and assignment to us of their ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. 

Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Many companies, including biotechnology, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, are actively engaged in activities similar to ours, including research, development, and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of rare medical conditions. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs, and more extensive commercial and manufacturing organizations than we do. In addition, many have considerable experience in preclinical testing, clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures. In addition, there are also academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research organizations who conduct research in areas in which we are working. We expect to encounter significant competition for any of the pharmaceutical products we plan to develop. Companies that successfully complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial marketing and sales of their products may achieve a significant competitive advantage. 
 
Antivirals: The pharmaceutical market for products that prevent or treat influenza is very competitive. Key competitive factors for RAPIVAB (peramivir injection) include, among others, efficacy, ease of use, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, storage and handling requirements and reimbursement. A number of neuraminidase inhibitors are currently available in the U.S. and/or other counties, including Japan, for the prevention or treatment of influenza, including seasonal flu vaccines and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.’s (“Roche”) TAMIFLU® (oseltamivir), generic oseltamivir, GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (“GSK”) RELENZA® and Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.’s INAVIR®. In addition, FUJIFILM Corporation’s favipiravir, a polymerase inhibitor, is approved in Japan. Roche’s neuraminidase inhibitor is also approved for prophylaxis of influenza.

In addition to the companies with approved neuraminidase inhibitors, there are a number of other companies that are developing potential new influenza therapies. In early 2018, Shionogi announced the approval in Japan of Xofluza, an oral treatment for influenza. Xofluza is a polymerase acidic endonuclease inhibitor and received FDA approval in October 2018 as a single-dose treatment for uncomplicated flu in patients ages 12 and older. Various government entities throughout the world are offering incentives, grants and contracts to encourage additional investment into preventative and therapeutic agents against influenza, which may have the effect of further increasing the number of our competitors and/or providing advantages to certain competitors.
 
Galidesivir is a product candidate in our BSAV research program and is currently being developed under contracts with NIAID/HHS and BARDA/HHS. The objective of our BSAV program is to develop galidesivir as a broad-spectrum therapeutic for viruses that pose a threat to national health and security. The U.S. Government is investing in a number of programs intended to address gaps in its medical countermeasure plan. Currently, there are five investigational therapeutics under a compassionate use/expanded access framework that can be available in an outbreak setting to treat Ebola virus disease. 
 
HAE: HAE is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by painful, unpredictable, recurrent attacks of inflammation affecting the hands, feet, face, abdomen, urogenital tract, and the larynx. The inflammation can be disfiguring, debilitating, or in the case of laryngeal attacks, life-threatening. Prevalence for HAE is uncertain but is estimated to be approximately 1 case per 50,000 persons without known differences among ethnic groups and is caused by deficient (Type I) or dysfunctional (Type II) levels of C1-Inhibitor (“C1-INH”), a naturally occurring molecule that is known to inhibit kallikrein, bradykinin, and other serine proteases in the blood. If left untreated, HAE can result in a mortality rate as high as 40% primarily due to upper airway obstruction. There are a number of licensed therapies for HAE, including the following:

• | C1-INH therapy is available as an acute therapy (Berinert®) and as a prophylactic therapy (Haegarda® and Cinryze®). These therapies are available subcutaneously and intravenously and work by replacing the missing or malfunctioning C1-INH protein in patients. Recominant C1-INH (Ruconest®) is also available as an acute therapy.

• | Kallikrein Inhibition - Kalbitor® (ecallantide) is a specific recombinant plasma kallikrein inhibitor that halts the production of bradykinin and can be dosed subcutaneously by healthcare providers to treat acute HAE attacks. Takhzyro™ (lanadelumab-flyo) is a monoclonal antibody approved for prophylaxis of HAE attacks that inhibits plasma kallikrein and can be self-administered as a subcutaneous injection. 
• | Bradykinin receptor antagonist - Firazyr® (icatibant) is a competitive antagonist of the bradykinin B2 receptor. Firazyr is approved for the treatment of acute attacks and is administered by subcutaneous administration. 
• | Other medications - Prophylactic administration of synthetic attenuated androgens (generically available as danazol or stanozolol) has been utilized to reduce the frequency or severity of attacks. However, long-term use of danazol or stanozolol may result in virilization and arterial hypertension. Six-month liver function tests, annual lipid profiles, and biennial hepatic ultrasound are recommended because these medications increase production of C1-INH in the liver.

 
In addition to BCX7353, there are a number of other HAE therapies in clinical development. KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has announced plans to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial in 2019 of an oral kallikrein inhibitor (KVD900) as a treatment for acute attacks. KalVista (KVD824) and Attune Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ATN-249) also have oral kallikrein inhibitors that may be developed as treatments for HAE. CSL has an anti-factor XII Mab (CSL312) in Phase 2 clinical development in HAE patients. 
 
FOP: FOP is a rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (“HO”). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. FOP patients progressively become bound by this irregular ossification, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.
 
Other FOP therapies in clinical development include Clementia Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s palovarotene, an oral, retinoic acid gamma receptor agonist. Clementia has announced plans to file a NDA for palovarotene in the second half of 2019. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial in FOP with REGN2477, an i.v. anti-activin antibody. Blueprint Medicines Corporation has initiated a Phase 1 trial of BLU-782, an oral ALK-2 kinase inhibitor in early 2019.
 
Complement-mediated diseases: Several rare diseases are known to be mediated by defects of the complement system, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (“aHUS”), and myasthenia gravis. Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Soliris® (eculizumab) is a C5 inhibitor that is commercialized for all three of these indications and had global sales of over $3.5 billion in 2018. Alexion has announced plans to file an NDA for Soliris in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) in 2019. Alexion also recently received FDA approval for Ultomiris™ (ravulizumab), a longer-acting C5 inhibitor, as a treatment for PNH in late 2018. Several other companies have active clinical development programs in complement-mediated diseases. Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s oral factor D inhibitor, ACH4471, is in Phase 2 clinical trials for PNH and for C3 glomerulonephritis (“C3G”) and also is conducting Phase 1 trials on two follow-on compounds, ACH5228 and ACH5548. Novartis AG is conducting a Phase 2 trial of an oral factor B inhibitor, LPN023, in PNH. Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is conducting Phase 1B/2 trials of APL-2, a subcutaneously delivered peptide that inhibits C3, in PNH, cold agglutin disease, warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and complement-dependent nephropathies. Ra Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing zilucoplan, a novel, injectable C5 inhibitor that is currently in Phase 2 trials for PNH and myasthenia gravis. Omeros Corporation is developing OMS721, an antibody that inhibits the lectin pathway, that is in Phase 2 or Phase 3 trials in conditions including IgA nephropathy, aHUS and lupus nephritis. ChemoCentryx, Inc. is developing avacopan, an oral C5aR inhibitor that is in Phase 3 for ANCA-associated vasculitis and Phase 2 for C3G. Several other companies including Regeneron, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Akari Therapeutics, Plc are developing C5 inhibitors for PNH and potentially other diseases of the complement system.

In order to compete successfully in these and other therapeutic areas, we must develop proprietary positions in patented drugs for therapeutic markets that have not been satisfactorily addressed by conventional research strategies and, in the process, expand our expertise in structure-based drug design. Our product candidates, even if successfully tested and developed, may not be adopted by physicians over other products and may not offer economically feasible alternatives to other therapies.
 
Research and Development
 
We initiated our research and development activities in 1986. We have assembled a scientific research staff with expertise in a broad base of advanced research technologies including protein biochemistry, X-ray crystallography, chemistry and pharmacology. Our research facilities, located in Birmingham, Alabama, include protein biochemistry and organic synthesis laboratories, testing facilities, X-ray crystallography, computer and graphics equipment and facilities to make product candidates on a small scale for early stage clinical trials.
Compliance
 
We conduct our business in an ethical, fair, honest and lawful manner. We act responsibly, respectfully and with integrity in our relationships with patients, health care professionals, collaborators, governments, regulatory entities, stockholders, suppliers and vendors.
 
In order to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Vice President of Human Resources oversee compliance training, education, auditing and monitoring; enforce disciplinary guidelines for any infractions of our corporate polices; implement new policies and procedures; respond to any detected issues; and undertake corrective action procedures. Our controls address compliance with laws and regulations that govern public pharmaceutical companies including, but not limited to, the following: federal and state law, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977; NASDAQ listing requirements; the regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority; the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”); the FDA; and the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Our standard operating procedures are designed to provide a framework for corporate governance in accordance with ethical standards and best legal practices.
 
Government Regulation
 
The FDA regulates the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in the U.S., and our product candidates are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulations prior to commercialization. The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In foreign countries, our products are also subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments. These government regulations will be a significant factor in the production and marketing of any pharmaceutical products that we develop. Failure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process may subject us to sanctions, including:

• | delays; 
--+-----------------------------
• | warning letters; 
• | fines; 
• | product recalls or seizures;
• | injunctions;

• | penalties; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | refusal of the FDA to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approval applications;
• | total or partial suspension of production; 
• | civil penalties; 
• | withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications; and 
• | criminal prosecutions. 

 
The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products, we or our partners must demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The approval process takes many years, substantial expenses may be incurred and significant time may be devoted to clinical development.
 
Before testing potential product candidates in humans, we carry out laboratory and animal studies to determine safety and biological activity. After completing preclinical trials, we must file an IND, including a proposal to begin clinical trials, with the FDA. Thirty days after filing an IND, a Phase 1 human clinical trial can start, unless the FDA places a hold on the trial.
 
Clinical trials to support a NDA are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap.
 
Phase 1—During Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy volunteers, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions and safety, including side effects associated with increasing doses.
 
Phase 2—Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to: (1) assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications; (2) assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
 
Phase 3 (pivotal)—If a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials, also called pivotal studies, major studies or advanced clinical trials, are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. In general, the FDA requires that at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials be conducted.
 
Initiation and completion of the clinical trial phases are dependent on several factors including things that are beyond our control. For example, the clinical trials cannot begin at a particular site until that site receives approval from its Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), which reviews the protocol and related documents. This process can take from several weeks to several months. In addition, clinical trials are dependent on patient enrollment, but the rate at which patients enroll in the study depends on:
 

• | willingness of investigators to participate in a study; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | ability of clinical sites to obtain approval from their IRB; 
• | the availability of the required number of eligible subjects to be enrolled in a given trial;
• | the availability of existing or other experimental drugs for the disease we intend to treat; 
• | the willingness of patients to participate; and 
• | the patients meeting the eligibility criteria. 

 
Delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased expense and longer development timelines.
 
After successful completion of the required clinical testing, generally an NDA is submitted. Upon receipt of the NDA, the FDA will review the application for completeness. Within 60 days, the FDA will determine if the application is sufficiently complete to warrant full review and will consider the application “filed” at that time. Also upon receipt of the application, the FDA will assign a review priority to the application. Priority review applications are usually reviewed within 6 months; standard review applications are usually reviewed within 10 months. The FDA will usually refer NDAs for new molecular entities to an appropriate advisory committee for review and evaluation in regards to providing a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound to follow the recommendation of an advisory committee.

Following the review of the application, which may include requests for additional information from the sponsor and results from inspections of manufacturing and clinical sites, the FDA will issue an “action letter” on the application. The action letter will either be an “approval letter,” in which case the product may be lawfully marketed in the United States, or a “complete response letter.” A complete response letter will state that the FDA cannot approve the NDA in its present form and, usually, will describe all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the application. The complete response letter, when possible, will include the FDA’s recommended actions to place the application in a condition for approval. Deficiencies can be minor (e.g., labeling changes) or major (e.g., requiring additional clinical trials). A complete response letter may also be issued before the FDA conducts the required facility inspection and/or reviews labeling, leaving the possibility that additional deficiencies in the original NDA could be subsequently cited. An applicant receiving a complete response letter is permitted to resubmit the NDA addressing the identified deficiencies (in which case a new two or six-month review cycle will begin), or withdraw the NDA. The FDA may consider a failure to take action within one year of a complete response letter to be a request to withdraw, unless the applicant has requested an extension of time in which to resubmit. If the FDA approves an NDA, the marketing of the product will be limited to the particular disease states and conditions of use that are described in the product label.
 
We and all of our contract manufacturers are also required to comply with the applicable FDA current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations during clinical development and to ensure that the product can be consistently manufactured to meet the specifications submitted in an NDA. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to product quality as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities must be approved by the FDA before they can be used to manufacture our products. Based on an inspection, the FDA determines whether manufacturing facilities are in compliance with applicable regulations. Manufacturing facilities in non-United States countries that are utilized to manufacture drugs for distribution into the United States are also subject to inspection by the FDA. Additionally, failure to comply with local regulatory requirements could affect production and availability of product in relevant markets.
