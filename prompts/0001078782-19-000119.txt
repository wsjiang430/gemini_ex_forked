Item 1. Business.
 
Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Registrant” or “the Company” refer to ZIVO Bioscience, Inc.., a Nevada corporation, and its subsidiaries.
 
General
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 28, 1983, under the name of “L. Peck Enterprises, Inc.” On May 27, 1999, we changed our name to “Western Glory Hole, Inc.” From 1990 until October 2003, we had no business operations; we were in the development stage and were seeking profitable business opportunities. On October 30, 2003, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Health Enhancement Corporation (“HEC”) in exchange for 9,000,000 of our shares, making HEC our wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with this transaction, we changed our name to Health Enhancement Products, Inc. On October 14, 2014, at the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company, a proposal was passed to change the name of the Company from Health Enhancement Products, Inc. to ZIVO Bioscience, Inc. (“ZIVO”). On October 30, 2014, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) approved the name ZIVO Bioscience, Inc. for trading purposes and the symbol change to ZIVO effective November 10, 2014.
 
We acquired HEC in 2003 because we believed its unique and complex algal culture produced natural bioactive compounds that promoted health benefits. A production facility based in Scottsdale, AZ produced and marketed a liquid dietary supplement with marginal success beginning in 2003 until sales were suspended in January of 2012.
 
Our new management team, in place since December 2011, determined the sole focus for the near term was to move forward with a research-based product development program. From 2012 through 2018, we engaged fully in such activities, all as more fully explained herein. We hold significant intellectual property in the form of bioactive compounds, patented applications and processes, an optimized algal strain, nutritional products and applications derived from our proprietary algal biomass that can find their way into food, feed, supplements and therapeutics.
 
From the start of 2017 and moving into 2019, we are conducting the final phase of validation for a discovery-stage bovine mastitis treatment, consisting of in vitro and in vivo studies, which is intended to dovetail with analytics and characterization of bioactive compounds produced by the algae itself. This body of work will be submitted to Zoetis, Inc. (ZTS) (“Zoetis”) a global animal health company, per an option/collaboration agreement dated December 19, 2013 and amended in 2014, to determine if our bioactive compounds exhibit efficacy in addressing bovine mastitis, a common condition afflicting dairy cows that results in milk production losses. Upon completion of the research, we expect to move into negotiations regarding the option payment and subsequent licensing.
 
Upon the finalization of the negotiations on the aforementioned option and license agreement, we plan to explore our options for further licensing arrangements as they relate to canine joint health and potentially human cholesterol management.
 
On the food and feed application side of the business, our business model anticipates deriving future income from licensing and selling natural ingredients that may be extracted from or are initially based on our proprietary alga1 cultures. In line with this, on April 20, 2017, we entered into a Limited License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with NutriQuest, LLC (“NutriQuest”) a recognized leader in animal health and nutrition solutions. In the License Agreement, we granted to NutriQuest a limited, exclusive license to market, distribute sell and collect the sales proceeds in all of our nutrition, feed additive and supplementation applications relating to naturally-derived algal biomass and extraction products for oral administration in swine and/or poultry species. As mentioned above, we affirmed human GRAS Generally Recognized As Safe, or “GRAS” status as a plant-based ingredient in food products for human consumption. We are in the process of garnering poultry GRAS status as a production feed ingredient and expect that approval in mid-2019. We have also entered into an Exclusive Supply Agreement (the “Exclusive Supply Agreement”) with NutriChipz, LLC (“NutriChipz”) to supply our algae as an ingredient in chips and crisps. Other applications available for out-licensing include spice mixes, rubs and condiments.
 
Further, we expect these new product formulations will likely be sold to much larger, well-established animal, food, dietary supplement and medical food manufacturers. The anticipated income streams are to be generated from a) royalties and advances for licensed natural bioactive ingredients, and b) bulk sales of such ingredients. We expect bulk ingredients to be made by contracted algae growers and then sold by us to animal food, dietary supplement and food processors and/or name-brand marketers.

In January 2007, we established HEPI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as our wholly owned subsidiary (“HEPI Pharma”). The purpose of HEPI Pharma was to develop potential pharmaceutical applications for the bioactive ingredients that may be derived from our algae cultures.
 
In February 2013, we formed ZIVO Biologic, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ZIVO Biologic”), for the purpose of manufacturing and commercialization of proprietary ingredients for non-medicinal animal health applications. ZIVO Biologic is 100% owned by ZIVO Bioscience, Inc.
 
In August 2013, we acquired the assets, consisting primarily of intellectual property rights, of Wellness Indicators, Inc. (“Wellness”), a Michigan corporation based in Illinois. Concurrently, we formed WellMetris, LLC as a 100% owned entity of ZIVO. In 2018, we changed the name of WellMetris, LLC to WellMetrix, LLC (“WellMetrix”). We acquired four patent applications as part of the transaction, in addition to engineering drawings, prototypes, chemical formulae, validation data, laboratory equipment and IT equipment. We assigned all of the intellectual property acquired to WellMetrix with a stated value of $1,391,281. 
 
The mission of WellMetrix is to develop, manufacture, market and sell Wellness Tests. The Wellness Tests are intended to provide individuals the information and opportunity to optimize their health and identify future health risks or to provide insurers, employers and healthcare providers with timely information to intervene with wellness programs, fitness regimes or other preventative measures. During the period of time we have owned WellMetrix, we have drafted and filed an additional eight patent applications around the intellectual property acquired, as noted in the section “Patents and Proprietary Rights.” In the summer of 2014, we evaluated the circumstances related to the original four patent applications acquired and determined that two of the existing patent applications could be improved and filed new patents applications to redefine and better protect our intellectual property. We have abandoned one of the initial four patent applications purchased, released two of the four applications purchased and substituted them with two new patent applications, and retained ownership of one of the four applications purchased, which has now converted to a national phase application. In connection with the abandoned patents, we have protected our rights with regards to the original patent applications purchased, however we determined we should record a loss on abandonment of $1,391,281 for the year ended December 31, 2014 as the initial value of the acquired patent applications pending resides in the newly drafted and filed eight patent applications. On December 25, 2018 the U.S Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued Patent No. 10,161,928 – Wellness Panel, effectively securing the core conceptual premise of the WellMetrix technology platform.
 
2018 Highlights
 
On the nutritional side of the business, in November 2018, we affirmed GRAS status for our ZIVO algal strain to be used as a plant based ingredient in food products for human consumption. A tradename was adopted -- KALGAE™ -- to simplify the scientific name of our premier strain. We’re also developing a consumer-facing ingredient brand-name, as well, to differentiate our optimized, non-GMO domesticated algal strain from the wild strains present in nature or other, less palatable algae such as spirulina or euglena, which are positioned as healthy food and beverage ingredients. 
 
We also executed a letter of intent with Grekin Laboratories and Dr. Steven Grekin to formulate, test, manufacture and market a suite of anti-aging and skin health supplements and food products featuring our proprietary algal biomass. ZIVO and Grekin have completed the formulation work and are engaged in manufacturing startup, to be followed by clinical trials and market launch.
 
We are in the process of garnering GRAS status for a poultry feed ingredient and expect that approval in mid-2019. To that end, we have completed a number of studies relating to poultry production that support optimized animal nutrition. At this time, ZIVO will not publicly divulge additional information regarding study performance due to marketing and product positioning considerations. These studies are being performed in conjunction with our licensing partner, NutriQuest, a global innovator in animal nutrition, as well as select contract research organizations. On the pharmaceutical side of the business, ongoing studies during 2018 re-confirmed the presence and efficacy of therapeutic agents which promote a robust immune response and address several inflammatory pathways in human, murine and bovine models. This builds on several years of research and validation to substantiate beneficial effects in combatting bovine mastitis, a condition typically caused by infective pathogens that results in loss of milk production. The elucidation and characterization of the therapeutic agents has continued in parallel, and we have engaged several university labs and private labs to continue this work, as it adds to the discovery-stage intellectual property that can be out-licensed or sold.
 
Relating to funding, 2018 saw a significant increase in the availability of funding. On the nutrition side, this allowed the Company to commence commercial scale-up with several Indian producers. The Indian producers have moved forward with open pond production, and we expect noticeable volume in Q1 2019. We have also expended considerable effort to bring Chinese producers on line and await formal product registration with the Chinese government to commence production in several regions within mainland China. In late 2018 we signed a formal letter of intent with a Peruvian producer that can ramp up production to significant levels in a relatively short timeframe, and has expressed interest in building new facilities to meet our demand for biomass.

We are continuing with our research partners to conduct classical, non-GMO strain development to improve cultivation efficiencies. On the pharmaceutical side, we are accelerating the discovery and analytics work pertinent to the bovine mastitis therapeutic candidate, and to enter the final arm of the in vivo validation study. A number of key research organizations were engaged to work on several fronts simultaneously in order to compress the timeframe and approach the tasks from different functional and analytical perspectives. The research organizations included the National Center for Natural Product Research at the University of Mississippi, Michigan State University School of Veterinary Medicine, University of North Carolina – Greensboro, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, Boston Institute of Biotechnology, Eurofins, SBH Biosciences, Dairy Experts and Elicityl. 
 
Marketing and Sales
 
ZIVO Algal Products & Derivatives
 
The marketing and sale of all future products are subject to compliance with applicable regulations. Based on the findings from ongoing research, we have approached and are continuing to approach potential customers or licensees in the market verticals described below. The products described throughout this document are still in the development stage, and are subject to development risk. There can be no assurance that any of the products described below will prove to be effective, or if found to be effective, will be able to be produced in a commercially viable manner.
Animal Health and Nutrition
 
A 2007 pilot study in dairy cows indicated that our algal culture may be effective in fending off the onset or significantly reducing symptoms of bovine mastitis – a condition that effectively stops milk production in affected cows. According to the National Mastitis Council, the condition affects 10% of the U.S. dairy herd at any one time, costing producers approximately $1,100 per case. In the U.S. alone, production losses are nearly $3 billion. Mycoplasma bovis causes a highly contagious and potentially fatal form of bovine mastitis (an infection of the mammary gland), for which there currently is no treatment. In the cow’s udder, mammary epithelial cells form an immunological barrier to protect the mammary gland. When bacteria or other pathogens break through this barrier, an infection can set in, affecting quality and quantity of milk produced. Our compounds showed promising early results for restoration of the immunological barrier in experiments conducted in vitro, as conducted by the Principal Researcher at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, Department of Dairy Science.
 
On December 20, 2013 (amended in 2014), we entered into a Collaboration and Option Agreement (the “Zoetis Agreement”) with Zoetis, a global animal health company, in connection with the prevention, treatment, and management of bovine mastitis. In the Zoetis Agreement, we granted to the counterparty an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive license with us. Specifically, upon completion of a collaborative study (which is in process), and acceptance of the work product by Zoetis, the Zoetis Agreement provides for a 90-day exclusivity period for evaluation of results, followed by a 90-day period to exercise the option and negotiate an option payment.
 
With respect to livestock and poultry applications, we intend to move on three related fronts – working to bring an algal feed ingredient to market in the United States and EU by amplifying the algae culture; working to produce a dietary supplement or feed additive for global consumption outside the U.S.; and, putting ourselves in a position to license the isolated bioactive molecules to a pharmaceutical or drug development company for synthetic development as a prescribed treatment for production animal applications. The isolated bioactive molecules form the intellectual property of interest to Zoetis. The feed ingredient, feed additive and dietary supplement are intended for other potential collaborators along with NutriQuest, (whose agreement covers swine and/or poultry species only).
 
A 2008 pilot study in dogs indicated that our algal culture may be effective in relieving the symptoms of osteoarthritis and soreness from overexertion. That same experiment with our amplified algae culture can be repeated in dogs, which if successful could allow a relatively rapid release to production and sales as a companion animal dietary supplement. According to the Nutrition Business Journal, the canine joint-health dietary supplement market segment tops $360 million annually in the U.S. alone. Estimates for the world market may be substantially higher, but such estimates are difficult to obtain. An in vitro tissue explant experiment conducted by the Comparative Orthopaedics Laboratory at University of Missouri found that direct stimulation of living canine joint tissue with our bioactive compounds protected cartilage from degradation by IL-1b, an inflammatory cytokine. If our product is proven to be effective in vivo and can be produced on an efficient basis, we intend to sell or license our product as a supplement ingredient to larger, well-established and profitable brand names in the pet industry. We have conducted other laboratory studies simulating the effects of canine osteoarthritis with generally positive results.

With all of the above, the isolated bioactive molecules found in the amplified algae product may, subject to successful negotiations, be licensed to a pharmaceutical company for development as a synthetic prescription drug. We expect that the process of developing and testing such a drug could take years. Therefore, as is common practice, we intend to work toward negotiating an upfront discovery-stage licensing fee, milestone payments upon each successful conclusion of a developmental phase, followed by pre-market approval; and finally, a steady stream of royalties in the future. The other revenue streams generated by feed and supplement sales may begin to be realized in 2019, but no assurance can be provided in that regard. Much of the research and licensing progress has been and will continue to be paced by the availability of capital funding and/or debt financing (see Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: Liquidity and Capital Resources).
 
In April 2017, we entered into the License Agreement with animal health innovator NutriQuest, which provides nutritional services to the biggest brand names in US poultry and pork production. We have completed a number of “pen” studies (pen studies are controlled testing of our ZIVO Algae to groups of incubator chicks ranging in size from 1,000 chicks to 25,000 chicks, ultimately up to 1 million chicks - “broilers”). Broilers consume more than 61 billion pounds of feed annually in the U.S.. The U.S. is the third-largest poultry producing nation. Phytogenic or plant-based ingredients like ours constitute the fastest-growing segment of the global poultry feed industry, currently generating about $780 million in sales annually, and growing at 8% annually. We are well-positioned to take market share if we meet our numbers. 
 
Functional Food Ingredient - Human
 
According to NutraIngredients-USA, functional foods, or health foods, represent an estimated $20 billion business in the U.S. and a $28 billion business in Europe. The Middle East, although significantly smaller, is growing at a rate of 12-14% annually, followed closely by the newly-affluent in China and India. These foods typically are processed products that contain one or more staple foods augmented with a variety of performance-enhancing ingredients.
 
We entered into the Exclusive Supply Agreement in 2018 to supply the ZIVO Algae to NutriChipz to gain a presence in the functional food market. As we move forward into 2019, we plan to work with other suppliers in the functional food market vertical as our algae supply expands.
 
Dietary Supplement & Nutraceutical - Human
 
The success of spirulina, dried kelp, Omega-3 fish oil, resveratrol, saw palmetto and similar supplements attests to the American public’s obsession with ‘natural’ products. The dietary supplement business is a $24 billion industry in the U.S. alone, and twice that the world over.
 
Rather than attempting to market as a branded nutraceutical or supplement, we will endeavor to private-label the compound or finished product for larger, well-established marketers and retailers. If we are able to accomplish this, we believe this is a more efficient use of capital and resources, while still retaining control of the intellectual property, the manufacturing process and pricing power. Our goal is not to be placed in a position where our premier product application is commodified and we must compete on price.
 
As an entry into this market, we have executed a letter of intent with Grekin Laboratories, directed by Dr. Steven K. Grekin, in a joint effort to develop, test and launch an exclusive line of products designed to address skin health and the appearance of aging through novel combinations of all-natural ingredients featuring the ZIVO proprietary algae strain. The initial product line being readied for launch includes a nourishing complex, fatty acid replenishment, collagen/protein mix and phytonutrient booster. 
 
Medicinal Food and Botanical Drug
 
Doctors prescribe medicinal foods and botanical drugs prior to, during or after various medical procedures, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and physical therapy. At times, medicinal foods are used to augment the effects of prescription drugs. These medicinal foods are expensive and typically reimbursed by health insurers. Botanical drugs can also be made available over-the- counter (OTC) after an extensive compliance program.
 
We believe that this area has potential for us if we can demonstrate that various properties of the algal extract can be isolated and produced as a medicinal food or beverage prescribed by physicians, or as an OTC botanical drug. These sectors are both regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Medicinal food standards are somewhat less stringent than pharmaceutical applications. Botanical drug standards are similar to other pharmaceutical applications. Under our business model, if we are able to produce a commercial product in these areas, we will endeavor to enter into a private-label arrangement with a larger strategic partner to produce and distribute these product applications.

Pharmaceuticals
 
We believe that we may be able to pursue prescription drug applications for our product. The process for developing a new prescription drug is costly, complex and time-consuming. It is an undertaking well beyond our financial capabilities and one that may take years to achieve. Our intent is to out-license the natural molecules at discovery stage and allow the licensee to develop the Investigatory New Drug (IND) filing and conduct subsequent safety/efficacy phases in order to bring a therapeutic product to market. If we elect to pursue the development of a prescription drug, we will likely seek a partnership with a co-developer that will share in the risk and expense of the initial development process, and then share in any royalties resulting from the licensing or sale of any synthetic molecule and its homologs we are able to develop and license. 
 
The first such step was the execution of the bovine mastitis Collaboration and Option Agreement with Zoetis. Part of our business plan is to execute agreements that may ultimately result in option payments, licenses fees and royalty payments across animal and human applications, typically at the discovery stage.
 
WellMetrix
 
WellMetrix was formed for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling tests that we believe will allow individuals and their care providers to optimize personal health and identify future health risks. The information obtained will also provide insurers, employers and healthcare providers timely information to intervene with wellness programs, fitness regimes or other preventative measures. We plan to develop and commercialize such tests in three phases:
 

In phase one (“Phase One”) or, alternately named Gen 1.0, we plan to develop and commercialize a series of tests, which are intended to measure indicators of good health and optimal metabolic function (collectively, the “Phase One Test”). The Phase One Test has been designed to measure biomarkers related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and antioxidant status to establish a metabolic assessment from which intervention can commence, and from which metabolic syndrome can be inferred. A patent that covers this particular combination of biomarkers was issued December 25, 2018. 
 

In phase two (“Phase Two”) or alternately named Gen 1.5, we plan to develop and commercialize a testing technology focused on the positive or negative metabolic effects of metabolizing fat and muscle efficiency due to changes in diet, exertion, hydration and dietary supplements in a self-administered format that integrates with smartphone operating systems. 
 

In phase three (“Phase Three”) or alternately named Gen 2.0, we plan to develop and commercialize additional tests intended to provide a more complete metabolic profile for an individual utilizing the metabolites present in urine. The Company believes the Gen 2.0 tests, in aggregate, will allow identification of healthy versus unhealthy bodily processes in real-time. This technology can also be applied to livestock and companion animals. As capital funding becomes available, the Company will move forward with finalizing its transition cow syndrome test, for which a provisional patent application has already been filed. 
 
We are currently in Phase One of development as described above.
 
We believe there is a viable market for our Wellness Tests. More than 19% of Americans are afflicted with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancer. The Wellness Tests are intended to identify pre-conditions to such illnesses. Such identification may allow for early intervention and reduce incidence of such illnesses or forestall their onset. This is critically important to large employers, insurers and governmental agencies who are payers for health claims and are facing massive increases in premiums or cash outlays.
 
The WellMetrix technology also incorporates sophisticated software to analyze, report, record and manage wellness and health data for an individual or large groups such as large employers, pension funds, accountable care organizations, state Medicaid agencies and their actuarial consultants, underwriters, re-insurers and wellness consultants. The software also contains tools to conduct meta-analysis of baseline health benchmarks and monitor the progress of pre-clinical intervention programs within large groups.
 
Due to funding issues, all development work has been halted until this entity is either sold, funded independently of ZIVO Bioscience, or spun out as a free-standing business.

Competition
 
ZIVO Algal Products & Derivatives
 
Generic dietary supplements and functional food ingredients such as vitamins, Omega-3 and antioxidants are made and marketed in a fiercely competitive, price-sensitive market environment. Recently, several algae producers have made health claims for their proprietary algae strains, ranging from alternative treatment for diabetes to controlling some HIV symptoms. Proprietary products offered by some marketers are often dogged by unsubstantiated claims of product efficacy or present potential product safety issues, which in turn draw the attention of regulators. The optimal position for a supplement and ingredient maker is when pricing power can be exerted through well-protected intellectual property and further backed by well-documented safety and efficacy claims.
 
We believe that our primary competition will come from innovators in food technology such as DSM-Martek, Cognis, ConAgra, Cargill and Nestle, each of which has active M&A efforts, a large scientific staff and a generous R&D budget to develop supplements and ingredients for a wide range of applications. However, we intend to approach these very same competitors as potential strategic partners, in order to leverage their specific expertise in certain food and supplement categories where a mutually beneficial relationship can be established. There can be no assurance that this strategy will be effective.
 
With respect to animal health, the companion animal dietary supplement segment, and specifically canine joint health, is made up almost exclusively of chondroitin/glutathione supplements, which have dominated that segment for more than a decade. This $360 million segment represents a potentially lucrative opportunity to introduce a completely new product if we are able to demonstrate superior benefits and produce a product at a comparable price. It is likely we will partner with an established animal health brand name.
 
Further, the animal health market as it pertains to mastitis in dairy cows, and specifically feed ingredients that exhibit beneficial properties, has been largely in the realm of yeast-based products. Only recently has there been a focus on algae-based alternatives, as promoted by Alltech with its $200 million expansion of an algae facility in Kentucky. In the U.S., feed ingredients cannot be promoted using any form of health claim, and dietary supplements for production animals are, to our knowledge, non-existent due to FDA/CVM regulation. However, outside the U.S., the use of dietary supplements is widespread, and we intend to market our refined ingredients to a worldwide market in partnership with a global brand name.
 
WellMetrix
 
The biomedical and biotech fields are fiercely competitive. Many of the “wellness” tests available to the healthcare consumer or provider are not necessarily accurate nor reliable because some do not take into account urine concentration as normalized by creatinine or specific gravity, which changes markedly throughout the day. Blood-based wellness tests can be even less reliable because the biomarkers for oxidative stress and inflammation are extremely dynamic and will often change before the blood can be tested, casting doubt on the results.
 
Although we are not aware that competitors or competing products have entered the market recently, there is no guarantee that our products will be proven to be effective and commercially viable, or that a larger, better-financed competitor may not emerge once we begin promoting our products.
 
Raw Materials
 
ZIVO Algal Products & Derivatives
 
We produce our microbial mixture using third party facilities. At the close of 2018, we continue to use the AzCATI facility at Arizona State University to produce our microbial mixture for continued experimentation and as a source of inoculum to seed ponds of contracted growers overseas. Our initial approach to building a global supply chain is to approach existing spirulina algae growers. Spirulina producers can easily convert their ponds to grow the ZIVO algae strain. This would allow us to rapidly build production capacity with relatively low capital expense. Once a licensed grower supply chain is established, we will endeavor to build larger scale facilities with joint venture partners in locations best suited for our proprietary algal strains. This is intended to provide stability and consistency in the global supply. 
 
In 2018 and into 2019, we have three ZIVO algae contract growers in India. We have signed two Letters of Intent with Chinese companies to commence production of our microbial mixture immediately upon approval from the Chinese Government to import our ZIVO Algae strain into China. We also have a Letter of Intent with a grower in Peru and are awaiting approval from that Government to import our ZIVO Algae strain into Peru. We are actively pursuing other algae producers in other areas of the world.

WellMetrix
 
In tandem with seeking regulatory approval, we will need two physical components to deliver our services. A dedicated, custom reader device and a test comprised of eight (8) different chemistry tests on a single urine test panel housed in a proprietary disposable cartridge.
 
The dedicated, custom reader device is manufactured by a third party to our specifications. We do not believe that there is a risk of supply, as there are several manufacturers available to produce the unit.
 
The test panel and proprietary cartridge are manufactured by a third party to our specifications. We do not believe that there is a risk of supply, as there are several manufacturers available to produce the units.
 
Dependence on Customers
 
ZIVO Algal Products & Derivatives
 
As discussed above, we reoriented the business model to focus on research and development in order to license our product and technology to third parties and to furnish algal biomass in bulk. Our potential customers are larger, well-established brand names in nutrition and health who will likely combine our algal biomass with other ingredients for feed, food and beverage applications. At this time, there are no customers providing any revenue.
 
WellMetrix
 
WellMetrix products will initially be private-labeled to established brand-names in the personal health space. Several such brand names have been approached, however, due to funding issues, this initiative has been placed on hold for the near term.
 
Production
 
ZIVO Algal Products & Derivatives
 
As discussed above in the section titled “Raw Materials”, we produce our microbial mixture using third party laboratory facilities. We are producing ZIVO algae at three contract growers in India. We have Letters of Intent to produce our ZIVO Algae in China and Peru upon in-country Government approval to import the ZIVO Algae strain. We are actively pursuing other algae producers in other areas of the world.
 
WellMetrix
 
As discussed above, we are using third parties to manufacture our custom reader device and test panel, which we are currently using for development purposes.

Regulation
 
ZIVO Algal Products & Derivatives
 
General Regulatory Framework
 
In the United States and in any foreign market we may choose to enter, our products are subject to extensive governmental regulations.
 
In the United States, these laws, regulations and other constraints exist at the federal, state and local levels and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions. The majority of these regulations directly relate to (1) the formulation, clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale and storage of our products and (2) product claims and advertising, including claims and advertising by us, as well as claims and advertising by distributors for which we may be held responsible.

14



U.S. product classification
 
In the U.S., the formulation, testing, manufacturing, packaging, storing, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies, primarily the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). Our activities also are regulated by various agencies of the states and localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured, promoted, distributed and sold. The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacture and labeling of conventional foods, dietary ingredients and dietary supplements (or nutraceuticals).
 
The FDA is responsible for the oversight of all foods (including dietary supplements), drugs, cosmetics and medical devices in the United States. To the extent that we manufacture finished products for sale to consumers (and in certain other limited circumstances where we sell our product as an ingredient), FDA regulations require us to comply with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) regulations for the preparation, packing and storage of dietary supplements. This is a complex series of regulations that have posed significant compliance challenges to the supplement industry. To the extent that we supply our products as ingredients for the use in foods or nutraceuticals, we would be required to comply with cGMP regulations for foods, as well as the provisions of the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 which require all companies involved in the production of food and food ingredients to develop and implement a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point program.
 
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”) revised the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act by recognizing “dietary supplements” as a distinct category of food and, we believe, is generally favorable to the dietary supplement industry. The legislation grandfathered, with some limitations, dietary ingredients that were on the market before October 15, 1994. A dietary supplement that contains a dietary ingredient that was not on the market before October 15, 1994 will require evidence of a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that it is reasonably expected to be safe. To the extent that we offer for sale unique, proprietary ingredients we will be required to file with the FDA evidence supporting the conclusion that we have a “reasonable expectation” that they will be safe for human consumption when used as directed. The FDA recently published an “Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking” which the nutraceutical industry believes will substantially increase the level of evidence required to satisfy the “reasonable expectation” standard.
 
DSHEA provides for specific nutritional labeling requirements for dietary supplements. DSHEA permits substantiated, truthful and non- misleading statements of nutritional support to be made in labeling, such as statements describing general well-being from consumption of a nutraceutical ingredient or the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in affecting or maintaining structure or function of the body. A company making a statement of nutritional support must possess adequate substantiating scientific evidence for the statement, disclose on the label that the FDA has not reviewed the statement and that the product is not intended to mitigate, treat, cure or prevent disease, and notify the FDA of the statement within 30 days after its initial use. To the extent we produce finished product for use by consumers as nutraceuticals, we will be required to comply with these provisions of DSHEA.
 
Labeling and advertising regulations
 
We may market one or more of our products as a conventional food or for use as an ingredient in conventional foods. Within the U.S., this category of products is subject to the Nutrition, Labeling and Education Act (“NLEA”) and regulations promulgated under the NLEA. The NLEA regulates health claims, ingredient labeling and nutrient content claims characterizing the level of a nutrient in the product. The ingredients added to conventional foods must either be GRAS or be approved as food additives under FDA regulations.
 
The FTC, which exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of our product, has for years instituted enforcement actions against companies marketing supplements for alleged false, misleading or unsubstantiated advertising of some of their products. The FTC has specific guides for advertising claim substantiation as well as for the use of testimonials. As a general matter, companies making health related claims for their products or ingredients are required to possess well designed human clinical studies supporting such claims at the time they are made. Enforcement actions have often resulted in consent decrees and significant monetary payments by the companies involved. In addition, the FTC has increased its scrutiny of the use of testimonials which we have and may in the future utilize.

15



International regulations of our products
 
In many foreign markets in which we may choose to offer our products for sale, we may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the relevant country’s ministry of health or comparable agency. This would hold true for jurisdictions such as Canada, the European Union, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The approval process generally requires us to present each product and product ingredient to appropriate regulators for review of data supporting safety as well as substantiating any claims we may desire to make. We would also be required to comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. Our failure to comply with these regulations could prevent our products from being legally offered for sale.
 
California Proposition 65
 
California’s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, also known as Proposition 65, provides that no person in the course of doing business shall knowingly discharge or release a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity into water or into land where such chemical passes or probably will pass into any source of drinking water, without first giving clear and reasonable warning. Among other things, the statute covers all consumer goods (including foods) sold in the State of California. Proposition 65 allows private enforcement actions (sometimes called “bounty hunter” actions). While we intend to take appropriate steps to ensure that any of our products that we may market will be in compliance with the Act, given the nature of this statute and the extremely low tolerance limits it establishes (well below federal requirements), there is a risk that we, our contracted producer or a licensee could be found liable for the presence of miniscule amounts of a prohibited chemical in our product. Such liability could be significant.
General
 
To the extent dictated by our research partners, we will continue to produce research-only feedstock for chemical analysis, safety studies and efficacy studies compliant with applicable state and federal regulations. However, we will rely on our research partners to conduct their respective R&D programs in a manner compliant with applicable regulation and law. Once a product concept has been fully developed, we intend to manufacture that product, either internally or on a contract basis. We intend to adhere to all state and federal food safety and food manufacturing regulations for applicable product categories, and to produce our algal biomass in compliance with standards set forth in our GRAS dossier. In either case, we intend to adhere to all state and federal regulations relative to the safety and efficacy of the product application, as well as relevant regulations covering the safe and consistent manufacture of that product.
Compliance
 
In November 2018, we affirmed GRAS status for use as a plant-based ingredient for human consumption. We are in the process of affirming poultry GRAS status and expect that approval in mid-2019. We have completed a number of studies relating to the poultry production that supports good animal nutrition. These studies are being performed in conjunction with our licensing partner, NutriQuest, a global innovator in animal nutrition. 
 
WellMetrix
 
We have worked to make the WellMetrix testing systems compliant with existing FDA regulations and to that end retained FDA counsel and a medical device consulting firm, which have advised us as to the most time and cost-efficient path to classification and approvals. This activity will be reactivated upon availability of additional funding.
 
Research and Development
 
ZIVO
 
Research
 
Our algal culture has been subjected to product testing in its original form over several years, beginning in 2004. In spring of 2009, we undertook a research and development process with a view to fractioning the existing product into much smaller, concentrated groups of molecules with similar physical properties. These groups were then tested in vivo and in vitro with successful results noted in maintaining healthy cholesterol levels. A patent application describing a novel method of cholesterol regulation was submitted to the USPTO in spring of 2010 and a PCT filing was submitted in February of 2011.

16



Since January 2012, we continue to develop our research programs internally and direct outside academic researchers, private laboratories or contract research organizations to conduct experiments, tests and studies on our behalf. We spent approximately $2,815,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 on research and development, as compared to $2,381,000 in 2017. The resources were spent on external research, mainly to independent facilities involved in the analysis and validation of our bioactive compounds in various applications and animal models. To date, all of these amounts have been directly expensed as they have been incurred.
 
Beginning in March 2016, the Company moved forward with the following R&D initiatives
 

Continuing a large-scale bovine mastitis study utilizing samples validated in vitro by the principal researcher at the University of Wisconsin - Madison and further validated in vivo by other researchers in the fall of 2016. The pre-pilot and pilot arms of this study have been completed. The primary arm of the study was delayed in 2018 due to inconsistencies in the testing sample, availability of research facilities, and delays in the analytical process. The primary study arm or a portion thereof is expected to commence in Q1 2019. The analytical work that must occur in tandem required the addition of new research resources in order to complete such work in a timely manner. 
 

A study utilizing cadaver cartilage and joint tissue at the Comparative Orthopaedics Laboratory located at the University of Missouri showed positive early results for protective effects in canine joint health, using our natural bioactive compounds. The study will be repeated and expanded when capital funding is made available. 
 

A canine whole blood experiment was conducted at an international contract research organization to study the effects of our natural bioactive compounds on inflammatory cytokines and chemokines present in blood to assess whether a systemic or localized mechanism of action can be determined. Although the results trended in a positive direction, Company principals determined that a more definitive in vivo study would be more useful. Such study is expected to be conducted when capital funding is available. 
 

The ongoing elucidation and characterization of the natural bioactive compounds had undergone a data integrity review in early 2014. Further work to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the bioactives had been placed on hold since spring of 2014 pending available funding. In mid-March 2016, the Company re-activated the elucidation and characterization as funding became available. The Center for Complex Carbohydrate Research at the University of Georgia was tasked with sample purification and preliminary analysis. Other laboratories were contracted to conduct bioassays to validate the bioactivity of the purified and isolated samples, with work ongoing at the close of 2018. 
 

Beginning in spring 2017, we contracted with the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi, the Boston Institute of Biotechnology, the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, Elicityl SA, SBH Biosciences and other research facilities to accelerate the elucidation and characterization of the bioactive compounds present in the algal biomass, with the intent to converge these findings with the in vivo validation conducted for treatment of bovine mastitis, and present this body of work to Zoetis and effectively start the clock on the 90-day evaluation period. Such work resulted in the characterization of numerous bioactive compounds, which requires additional screening and validation to separate bioactives pertinent to bovine mastitis from those pertinent to other human and animal models. 
 

Beginning in fall 2016, we commenced a significant number of tests to determine the nutritional composition of the algal biomass, its toxicity, genetic mutagenicity, bacterial count and other safety measures for successive batches of biomass produced at AzCATI and other producers to establish consistent production and repeatability in anticipation of GRAS approvals. These tests form the basis for safety and stability claims as part of the requirement to meet GRAS standards applicable to both human and poultry uses. 
 

As mentioned previously, 2018 saw an increase in R&D spending and the active recruitment of algae growers in India and China, as well as other parts of the world. We engaged an outside consultant to advise us on outsourcing algae production and hired an experienced supply chain and operations manager to develop our internal and external organizational structures to support a global supply chain in anticipation of a market launch in early 2019 pending availability of biomass from contracted growers In addition, we worked closely with our animal feed partner NutriQuest to conduct initial trials and analyses of a potential poultry feed ingredient, with good results. The FDA compliance effort for a poultry feed ingredient is still underway and is expected to dovetail with product availability in mid-2019. 

17



The purposes for these various tests and experiments are manifold: We are not only isolating bioactive molecules, but also testing the method of isolation and then validating that the isolated molecules retain their bioactivity across a select range of human and animal cell lines, and that these molecules exhibit no deleterious effects before they are introduced into humans or animals during in vivo studies. We must ensure that this does not occur occasionally, it is required for every production process, every safety validation process and every intended application, such as a canine dietary supplement that is mixed with food, as opposed to a canine dietary supplement that is administered in the form of a chewable caplet.
 

As of late 2018, as we enter production scale-up, we are required to provide cGMP protocols and Quality Assurance (“QA”) protocols that show we can produce the algal biomass and/or the active ingredients safely, consistently and in defined quantities, and therefore rely on these same experiments and methods to substantiate our quality claims. These datasets form the basis for establishing the value of a license agreement. Therefore, every single license that we hope to issue requires its own data set and safety validation for the specific application being licensed. These datasets represent the core of the intellectual property that is being licensed.
 
Status of Culturing and Production
 
Independent of identifying the bioactive compound(s) or validating their bioactivity and safety is the process and method of growing and maintaining the algal culture that gives rise to various nutritional and bioactive compound(s) in the first place. This culture and its growing environment were developed decades ago. However, the method was not commercially viable, and the Company has expended considerable resources to develop a single-species, high-volume and commercially viable production methodology.
 
We made the decision to spread product development risk, resulting in the creation of a product platform strategy whereby four different forms could be developed for future marketing across several categories and applications:
 
a)
the raw algae biomass, which would naturally contain various nutritional and beneficial compounds; 
 b)
a more refined extraction which could be introduced into animal feed or supplements; 
 c)
the isolated natural molecule(s) which could be more appropriate for human consumption in food or supplements; and 
 d)
the synthetic version of any such natural molecule(s) which could be licensed to drug development companies or joint-ventured in a risk-sharing arrangement. 
 
To that end, we contracted with several experts in the field to coordinate isolation of the different organisms present in the culture, grow each of them separately and then subject them to the same life-cycle stressors as the original culture. The stated goal was to grow algae in bulk as a direct source of micro-nutrition and feed ingredient for production animals, namely poultry, beef cattle and dairy cows, as well as companion animal dietary supplementation. The production capability would be licensed or contracted to others. Per the business model, we have no intention of fielding a finished product, but rather coordinating licensees and entering into supply agreements with larger, better-financed brand names or licensing directly with such brand names. There can be no assurance that commercially viable products will be developed, or that they can be successfully and profitably manufactured and marketed.
 
Over the last several years, our contracted researchers were able to successfully isolate one or more algal species, scale up the production/output of the isolated species and still retain some of the key, desirable bioactive properties associated with the earlier, complex culture. Proof of concept growing techniques, including both pond and bioreactor modes, showed that our target algal specie can be grown in commercially viable quantities, and the harvest time was compressed from several weeks to several days’ time. We are uncertain if we can grow biomass in sufficient tonnage for livestock feed, but we believe that the current production methods will allow us to satisfy demand for a more refined product introduced into animal feed and into human supplements as global production capacity ramps up.
 
In 2018, we updated Standard Operating Procedures (“SOPs”) in order to draft contractual terms with contract growers domestically and abroad. The SOPs form the basis for current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) protocols to which contract growers and processors must adhere as part of the FDA’s updated Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 requirements, regardless of country of origin. We conducted experiments in post-processing, such as spray-drying centrifugal water extraction and other techniques to better understand feed and food handling requirements. We contracted the Burdock Group of Orlando, Florida in summer of 2016 to manage the compliance process on our behalf and we affirmed GRAS self-affirmation in November 2018.

18



Looking Forward
 
A significant portion of our research efforts have been directed towards identifying a candidate “class of compound” and one or more “active ingredients,” as it relates to autoimmune and anti-inflammatory response. These are very broad categories and work is still required to fully describe the 3D structure of such compounds to fully realize their potential licensing value. One approach among several we’ve taken is to create synthetic homologs, and from them deduce the composition and 3D structure of the naturally bioactive compounds. 
 
Subject to the availability of sufficient funding, we estimate that we will, in fiscal 2019, be required to expend in excess of $5,000,000 on research and subsequent product development and manufacturing in order to complete the initiatives discussed herein. In addition to the activity in 2019, we plan to continue our research and development efforts as well as manufacturing in 2019 and beyond. These expenditures will need to be met from external funding sources as well as revenues we intend to receive. In the past, we have had difficulty raising funds from external sources. Thus, we may not be able to raise the funding required to continue our research and development activities. In the event that these sources are not available or adequate to meet our research needs, we will be unable to pursue our research activities, in which case our ability to substantiate the accumulated intellectual property with objective clinical support for its characterization, method of action and efficacy will continue to be impeded, thereby severely hindering our ability to generate licensing revenue (or otherwise commercialize our products) and adversely affect our operating results.
 
In the event that we are successful in raising the necessary capital, we will continue our current research program with our research partners, we will expand our investigations to include various experts and consultants on an as-needed basis and explore new product concepts and applications. Our current contracts with our research partners cover the following activities:
 

Ongoing isolation and characterization of individual natural molecules from various production formats in sufficient quantities for downstream analyses, experiments, standards development, compliance, cGMP and QA protocols, whether as the basis for feed or food applications, as a lead compound for a synthetic therapeutic, or as a medical food or botanical drug 
 

Ongoing validation of samples in vivo and in vitro to substantiate efficacy and safety for each specific application or claim, i.e., bovine mastitis, poultry nutrition, health, canine osteoarthritis, canine joint health, porcine respiratory/reproductive syndrome, etc., to boost value for each specific license or market vertical 
 

Synthetic development/validation of individual molecules to boost value of licenses, likely to be conducted by others, either as licensees or joint ventures 
 

Ongoing validation of samples in vivo and in vitro for standards development, FDA safety compliance, cGMP and QA protocols 
 

Product development initiatives such as the joint development project with NutriQuest to develop a successful poultry feed ingredient; the project with NutriChipz to develop products in the functional food market; the project with Dr. Steven K. Grekin to develop skin health with other partners, to develop a protein enhancement ingredient for vegan drinks and smoothies as well as a human dietary supplement formulation 
 
Ancillary development activities would occur in parallel with our research partners.
 
Development
 
WellMetrix
 
WellMetrix was initially focused on large-scale, programmatic applications of its testing and reporting platform. We are interested in supporting the intervention by wellness consultants or medical professionals in the lifestyle choices made by individuals covered by traditional health insurance plans, retiree medical benefits pools, employer-sponsored health initiatives and taxpayer-sponsored programs like Medicaid and the ACA (Affordable Care Act) or its proposed replacement. These interventions, which are typically pre-clinical, have been shown to be successful in delaying the onset of chronic diseases such as diabetes or cardiovascular problems. We believe that targeting asymptomatic individuals and focusing intervention efforts on these individuals may have a positive result for wellness programs, and potentially lower premiums and health claims.

19



At the close of 2015, the WellMetrix product platform required additional prototype analyzers and additional dry chemistry reagent strips and cartridges to conduct pilot programs for potential customers, and to use the results of these pilot programs to help normalize data for the dry chemistry reagents as part of the FDA submission package.
 
In early 2016 we refocused product development on self-monitoring of individual health, primarily focused on those individuals who purchase dietary supplements, join health clubs or are otherwise actively pursuing a healthy lifestyle. Since that time, we have redeveloped the sample collection device, the analyzer and the mobile software application to better serve the needs of the consumer, rather than a workplace wellness provider. In 2018, we completed CAD design of all key components, conducted finite element analysis of the sample collection device to make sure that it functioned as intended and prepared CAD files for low-volume tooling of key components. We did not have the financial or scientific resources to complete all aspects of the testing assay, which requires additional development before it is ready for production, or the mobile software application, pending available funding. 
 
The company filed a trademark for “WellMetrix” and purchased the ICANN domain www.wellmetrix.com and www.wellmetrix-bts.com and registered “WellMetrix” as an LLC in the state of Delaware.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
We believe that we are, in all material respects, in compliance with local, state, and federal environmental laws applicable to our production and waste disposal. The cost of this compliance activity to date has not been material, and has been absorbed within our general operations overhead.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had four full-time employees, positioned in executive management. In addition, we have a part-time person acting on a consulting basis as our Director, Research & Development. We believe that our employee relations are good. No employee is represented by a union.
