Item 1.     Business
General
 
We were incorporated in Delaware in 1984. Until March 2, 2018, we were a leading design, marketing and distribution resource in the upscale segment of the wood residential furniture market. On March 2, 2018, we sold substantially all our assets and changed our name to HG Holdings, Inc.
Asset Sale
 
On March 2, 2018, we sold substantially all of our assets (the “Asset Sale”) to Stanley Furniture Company LLC, formerly Churchill Downs LLC (“Buyer”), pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 20, 2018, as amended by the First Amendment thereto dated January 22, 2018 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”). Operations of the furniture business from January 1, 2018 through March 2, 2018 are reflected as discontinued operations pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 2015-20, Presentation of Financial Statements – Discontinued Operations for all periods presented.
 
As consideration for the Asset Sale, Buyer paid a purchase price consisting of cash in the amount of approximately $10.8 million (of which approximately $1.3 million was used to pay the outstanding amount under our credit agreement), a subordinated secured promissory note in the principal amount of approximately $7.4 million (the “Original Note”), and a 5% equity interest in Buyer’s post-closing ultimate parent company, Churchill Downs Holdings, Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company. At the closing of the Asset Sale, Buyer acquired approximately $193,000 of cash that was on the Company’s balance sheet, resulting in the Company recording net cash received of approximately $10.6 million from the Asset Sale. The Buyer also assumed substantially all of our liabilities. We retained certain assets, which we refer to as excluded assets, including:
 

● | cash in the amount of approximately $800,000, including restricted cash in an amount equal to approximately $632,000; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the rights to and interest in any distributions after the closing date of monies collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection under the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (“CDSOA”) and to distributions of any prepaid legal expenses held by the Committee for Legal Trade relating thereto; 
● | a split dollar life insurance policy for a former executive officer and related collateral assignment providing for repayment at death of premiums we paid of approximately $465,000; 
● | the corporate seals, organizational documents, minute books, stock books, tax returns, books of account or other records having to do with our corporate organization; 
● | all insurance policies and all rights to applicable claims and proceeds under our insurance policies with respect to the excluded assets or excluded liabilities; 
● | certain of our agreements and contracts, including indemnification agreements between us and our directors, the services agreement with our registered accounting firm and the separation agreement between us and our former chief executive officer and the change in control protection agreement between us and our current principal financial officer;
● | certain of our employee benefit plans, including our incentive compensation plans and annual bonus plan; 
● | all of our tax assets, including our net operating loss carryforwards and any tax refunds and prepayments; 
● | all rights to any action, suit or claim of any nature with respect to any excluded asset or excluded liability; 
● | all guarantees, warranties, indemnities and similar rights in favor of us with respect to any excluded asset or excluded liability; 
● | all of our rights under the Asset Purchase Agreement and any related document; and 
● | all records, correspondence and other materials prepared by or on behalf of us in connection with the Asset Sale Transaction. 

 
Buyer also assumed substantially all of our liabilities; however, we retained certain liabilities, which we refer to as excluded liabilities, including:
 

● | liabilities or obligations with respect to an excluded asset including the separation agreement with our former President and Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of approximately $870,000 and certain worker’s compensation claims associated with our restricted cash of approximately $224,000;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | dividends payable of approximately $158,000 with respect to restricted shares of our common stock awarded under our incentive compensation plans and annual bonus plan; and 
● | costs and expenses of approximately $2.15 million incurred by us in connection with the negotiation, preparation and performance of the Asset Purchase Agreement and any related agreements or documents.

We previously indicated our board of directors would evaluate alternatives for use of the cash consideration from the Asset Sale, including using a portion of the cash to either repurchase our common stock or pay a special dividend to stockholders and also using a portion of the cash to acquire non-furniture related assets that will allow us to potentially derive a benefit from its net operating loss carryforwards. Our board of directors determined not to pay a special dividend and to use our existing authorization for stock repurchases to repurchase our common stock from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, at prices we deem appropriate. We purchased approximately 268,000 shares during 2018.  Our board does not intend to repurchase additional shares of our common stock at this time and anticipates retaining the remaining cash for use in acquiring non-furniture related assets and to fund operating expenses until an acquisition.  Our board is also considering a rights offering of our common stock to existing stockholders to raise additional cash for acquisitions in addition to the equity interest in HC Realty which could provide us greater resources and flexibility in acquiring non-furniture assets, which may include purchasing additional HC Series B Stock.
 
Stone & Leigh Asset Sale
 
On September 6, 2018, the Buyer sold certain of its assets, including certain inventory and the Stone & Leigh tradename (the “S&L Asset Sale”) to Stone & Leigh, LLC (“S&L”), which is owned by a group which includes Matthew W. Smith, the Company’s former interim Chief Executive Officer.  As a part of the S&L Asset Sale, the Buyer assigned to S&L certain of its rights and obligations under the Original Note issued to the Company in March 2018 as partial consideration for the Asset Sale.  In connection with the assignment, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Subordinated Secured promissory note with the Buyer (the “A&R Note”) with a principal amount as of the assignment date of $3.3 million and a new Subordinated Secured Promissory Note with S&L (the “New Note”) with a principal amount of $4.4 million as of the assignment date.  For further information on the A&R Note and New Note, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.   
Acquisition of Equity Interest in HC Government Realty Trust, Inc.
 
We have acquired an equity interest in HC Government Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (“HC Realty”).  HC Realty currently owns and operates a portfolio of 16 single-tenant properties leased entirely to the United States of America for occupancy by federal agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Transportation. 
 
On March 19, 2019, we purchased 300,000 shares of HC Realty’s Common Stock (the “HC Common Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price of $3,000,000 and 200,000 shares of HC Realty’s 10.00% Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the “HC Series B Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price of $2,000,000.  As a result of these purchases, we currently own approximately 16.7% of the as-converted equity interest of HC Realty.
 
Certain other investors, including certain investors affiliated with Hale Partnership Capital Management, LLC (“HPCM”), purchased an additional 850,000 shares of Series B Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $8,500,000 on March 19, 2019.  On March 21, 2019, HC Realty’s board of directors excepted the acquisitions of HC Common Stock and/or Series B Stock as discussed above from the ownership restrictions included in HC Realty’s articles of incorporation. 
 
On March 19, 2019, we, together with certain other lenders, including certain entities affiliated with HPCM (collectively, the “Lenders”), entered into a loan agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with HC Realty’s operating partnership, and HCM Agency, LLC, as collateral agent (the “Agent”), pursuant to which the Lenders provided HC Realty’s operating partnership with a $10,500,000 senior secured term loan (the “Initial Term Loan”), of which $2,000,000 was provided by us. The Agent is affiliated with HPCM.
 
In connection with the transactions discussed above, Steven A. Hale II, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, was appointed to serve as HC Realty’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately.  In addition, Mr. Hale, Brad G. Garner, our Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, and Matthew A. Hultquist, one of our directors, were each appointed to serve as directors of HC Realty, effective immediately.  Messrs. Hale, Garner and Hultquist will receive no compensation from HC Realty for serving in these roles.  HC Realty’s Board of Directors is composed of seven directors with three positions currently vacant.
 
Additional information on HC Common Stock, HC Series B Stock, the Loan Agreement and HC Realty is disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 25, 2019, which is incorporated herein by reference.
