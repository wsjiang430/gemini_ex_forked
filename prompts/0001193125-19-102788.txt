 Technology 
 Our core technologies are data visualization technologies that relate to (1) acquiring data, (2) conditioning the data, (3) displaying the data on hard copy, monitor or electronic storage media, and (4) analyzing the data. 
Patents and Copyrights 
 We hold a number of product patents in the United States and in foreign countries. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions to protect our technology and brand name. While we consider our intellectual property to be important to the operation of our business, we do not believe that any existing patent, license, trademark or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material adverse effect on the Companys business taken as a whole. 
Manufacturing and Supplies 
 We manufacture many of the products that we design and sell. Raw materials and supplies are typically available from a wide variety of sources. We manufacture many of the sub-assemblies and parts in-house including printed circuit board assemblies, harnesses, machined parts and general final assembly. Many parts not manufactured in-house are standard electronic items available from multiple sources. Other parts are designed by us and manufactured by outside vendors. We purchase certain components, assembled products and supplies used in the manufacture of our products from a single source or limited supplier source. While we believe these components, products and supplies could be sourced elsewhere with appropriate changes in the design of our products, such design might not be feasible on a timely basis and any interruption in these components, products or supplies could adversely affect our business.
