Corporate History
 
In 1996, Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"). Two of the many features of HIPAA were a mandate that the healthcare industry move toward using electronic communication technology to streamline and reduce the cost of healthcare, and a requirement that healthcare providers treat virtually all healthcare information as confidential, especially when electronically transmitted.
 
In 2001, Mr. Manfred Sternberg acquired effective control of the Company and during 2002 and 2003 under his leadership, the company commenced development and completion of the necessary systems to offer an integrated HIPAA compliant Medical Grade Network® to the health care community, to provide electronic systems required by increasing U.S. public policy mandates, to accelerate the movement to secure electronic health records.
 
In 2003, a minority amount of our revenue was related to our HIPAA business. In 2004, a majority of our revenue was related to our HIPAA business. In 2005, all of our revenues were related to our health care service model.
 
In 2004, to accelerate our movement into the electronic health record business, we sold our Internet Service Provider ("ISP") customer base effective June 21, 2004 to concentrate on our health care IT solutions model and its Medical Grade Network®.
 
In 2004, we contracted with the largest healthcare system in Texas to provide physicians with Internet bandwidth and managed security services using our Medical Grade Network®.
 
In March 2005, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain ongoing contractual obligations of TEKMedia Communications, Inc., a company that provided traditional IT consulting services.
 
In September 2005, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain ongoing contractual obligations of Trilliant Corporation, a company that provides assessment, design, vendor selection, procurement and project management for large technology initiatives, particularly in the healthcare arena.
 
Effective November 7, 2009, the Company: 1) disposed of certain Medical Grade Network (“MGN”) assets and business and eliminated certain liabilities (consisting primarily of: a) furniture, computers and related software and peripherals with a $17,889 book value; b) contracts, agreements, lists of telephone and fax numbers, licenses, permits, intellectual properties, registered mark for MGN, and the business name of Bluegate with a $0 net book value; c) liabilities of $43,607 principally related to customer product prepays which were assumed by the purchaser) which were acquired by Sperco, LLC (“Sperco”) (an entity controlled by Mr. Stephen Sperco (“SS”), our former CEO/President/Director)), for $200,000, with payment made by a combination of $100,000 cash and $100,000 forgiveness of debt owed to SAI Corporation (“SAIC”) (an entity controlled by SS), plus a net adjustment of $7,100 due to the Company from Sperco resulting from the Company’s collection of principally accounts receivable totaling $161,900 on behalf of Sperco for the period from November 8, 2009 through December 31, 2009, offset by Sperco’s payment of $169,000 to the Company for the personnel, facilities, tools, and resources necessary for the Company to support both the MGN and HIMS (defined below) operations for Sperco for the same period; 2) entered into a Separation Agreement and Mutual Release in Full of all claims with Mr. Manfred Sternberg (“MS”) (former Director/Corporate Officer), which included the elimination of $28,499 of accrued director fees and vehicle allowances in exchange for repayment of a loan plus accrued interest totaling $44,369 to MS; and 3) entered into A Separation Agreement and Mutual Release in Full of all claims with Mr. William Koehler (“WK”) (former Director/Corporate Officer), which included the elimination of $28,499 of accrued director fees and vehicle allowances in exchange for repayment of a loan plus accrued interest totaling $44,374 with a direct payment to WK’s American Express account and a $1 payment to WK; and 4) disposed of certain of Trilliant Technology Group, Inc.’s assets and business (consisting primarily of: a) Computers and related software and peripherals with a $0 net book value; and b) lists of telephone and fax numbers and intellectual properties with a $0 net book value) to Trilliant Corporation (an entity controlled by WK) for a cash payment of $5,000; and 5) disposed of certain Bluegate Healthcare Information Management Systems (“HIMS”) assets and business (consisting primarily of contracts, agreements and intellectual property with a $0 net book value) to SAIC in exchange for a Mutual Release in Full of certain claims and a $1 payment to SAIC; and 6) obtained a Fairness Opinion dated November 6, 2009 presented by Convergent Capital Appraisers.
 
Pursuant to the Nevada Revised Statutes, which authorizes the taking of action by written consent of the shareholders of a Nevada corporation, without a meeting, a super majority of the voting power of the shareholders of the Company gave their consent to the above actions.
 
As a result of the transactions summarized above, the Company received $105,000 cash; reduced the secured note payable to SAIC by $100,000; paid off unsecured notes payable and accrued interest of $88,743 to MS and WK; eliminated $56,998 of accrued liabilities owed to MS and WK; recorded $24,234 of expenses (principally legal and professional); removed the remaining book value of fixed assets of $17,889; eliminated $43,607 of customer liabilities assumed by Sperco and increased additional paid-in capital by $263,484 since the net effect of the transaction was treated as related party forgiveness of debt.

On December 27, 2010 our then 100% owned subsidiary, Trilliant Technology Group, Inc. was dissolved.
 
On September 11, 2014, SAIC, the Company’s then majority shareholder, sold to Mr. Ang Woon Han, 24,070,250 shares of common stock (1,203,513 shares post-Reverse Stock Split discussed below), 48 shares of Series C Convertible preferred stock and 10 shares of Series D Convertible preferred stock. As a result, Mr. Ang owns 52% of our shares of common stock without taking into account the super voting power of the Preferred stock, and 78% when taking into account the super voting power of the Preferred Stock.
 
On January 2, 2015, the Company filed an Information Statement on Schedule 14C for restructuring the Company. Actions taken included:
 

· | To change the name of the Company from “Bluegate Corporation” to “Logicquest Technology, Inc.” 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | To increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 from fifty million (50,000,000) to two hundred million (200,000,000) (the “Authorized Increase”); and 
· | To affect a reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock at a ratio of one post-split share per twenty pre-split shares (the “Reverse Stock Split”).

 
The above actions were effective on March 19, 2015.
 
Our Business Subsequent To the November 7, 2009 Disposition Of Certain Assets And Business
 
We are currently a company with no operations. To sustain our company’s operation, our Board is currently seeking investment opportunities.
 
At this stage, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities, what additional financing we will require to complete a business opportunity, or whether the opportunity's operations will be profitable.
 
If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our business, our shareholders will lose some or all of their investment and our business will likely fail.
 
Development Plan
 
Our intended business purpose is to seek the acquisition of, or merger with, an existing company. The acquisition of a business opportunity may be made by purchase, merger, exchange of stock, or otherwise, and may encompass assets or a business entity, such as a corporation, limited liability company, joint venture, or partnership. We have very limited capital, and it is unlikely that we will be able to take advantage of more than one such business opportunity. We will not restrict potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. As of the date hereof, we have made only limited efforts to identify a possible business combination and are not currently subject to a letter of intent with respect to any target business or any definitive agreement with respect to any target business.
 
Based on our proposed business activities, we are a “blank check” company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) defines “blank check” companies as, any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Exchange Act, and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.
 
We also qualify as a “shell company,” as defined under Rule 12b-2 adopted by the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, because we have no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of blank check companies in their respective jurisdictions.
 
We have a nominal amount of capital and will depend on our management to provide us with the necessary funds to implement our business plan. We intend to seek opportunities demonstrating the potential of long-term growth as opposed to short-term earnings. However, at the present time, we have not identified any business opportunity that we plan to pursue, nor have we reached any agreement or definitive understanding with any person concerning an acquisition or merger. The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our sole officer and director.

We believe that business opportunities may come to our attention from various sources, including, professional advisors such as attorneys, and accountants, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. We have no plan, understanding, agreements, or commitments with any individual for such person to act as a finder of opportunities for us. We can give no assurances that we will be successful in finding or acquiring a desirable business opportunity, given the limited funds that are expected to be available to us for implementation of our business plan. Furthermore, we can give no assurances that any acquisition, if it occurs, will be on terms that are favorable to us or our current stockholders. In our effort to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider the following kinds of factors:
 

· | Potential for growth, anticipated market expansion or new products; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;
· | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 
· | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds; 
· | The cost of participation by us as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible risks of participation; 
· | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 
· | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance, and other required items; and 
· | Other relevant factors. 

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which may make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or be able to fully investigate potential adverse factors concerning the opportunity to be acquired.
 
There is no relationship between our particular name and our intended business plan. If successful in completing a merger or acquisition, we expect that our name would change to reflect the marketing goals of the business combination.
 
We are unable to predict the time as to when, and if we will ever engage in identifying potential merger or acquisition candidates.
 
In addition, certain conflicts of interest exist or may develop between us and our sole officer and director and majority stockholder.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us. Also, substantial fees are often paid in connection with the completion of all types of acquisitions, reorganizations or mergers.
 
Form of Acquisition
 
The manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of us and the promoters of the opportunity, and our relative negotiating strength. It is likely that we will acquire our participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of our common stock or other securities. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “tax free” reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other tax-free transaction provisions under the Code, all prior stockholders would retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who are stockholders prior to the acquisition. Our present stockholders will likely not have control of our majority voting securities following an acquisition transaction. However, our present stockholders will benefit from such a transaction by retaining an equity interest in the surviving company, a cash payment in exchange for outstanding shares, or a combination of both cash and equity. As part of such a transaction, our present sole officer and director may resign and one or more new directors or officers may be appointed in connection with the transaction.

-

In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by stockholders or only with the vote of our majority stockholders who already control the vote on all stockholder matters. It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to us of the related costs incurred.
