ITEM 1. BUSINESS
​
Monarch Casino & Resort, Inc. was incorporated in Nevada in 1993 and, along with its consolidated subsidiaries, is referred to collectively in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as “Monarch,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us.” Monarch owns and operates the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa, a hotel and casino in Reno, Nevada (the “Atlantis”) and the Monarch Casino Resort Spa Black Hawk (the “Monarch Black Hawk”), a hotel and casino in Black Hawk, Colorado. In addition, we own separate parcels of land located next to the Atlantis and a parcel of land with an industrial warehouse located between Denver, Colorado and Monarch Black Hawk. We also own Chicago Dogs Eatery, Inc. and Monarch Promotional Association Inc., both of which were formed in relation to licensure requirements for extended hours of liquor operation in Black Hawk, Colorado.
​
Our business strategy is to maximize revenues, operating income and cash flow primarily through our casino, food and beverage and hotel operations. We focus on delivering exceptional service and value to our guests. Our hands-on management style focuses on customer service and cost efficiencies.
​
The Atlantis Casino Resort Spa
​
The Atlantis is located approximately three miles south of downtown in the generally more affluent area of Reno, Nevada. The Atlantis features approximately 61,000 square feet of casino space; 817 guest rooms and suites; eight food outlets; two gourmet coffee and pastry bars and one snack bar; a 30,000 square-foot health spa and salon with an enclosed year-round pool; two retail outlets offering clothing and gift shop merchandise; an 8,000 square-foot family entertainment center; and approximately 52,000 square feet of banquet, convention and meeting room space. The casino features approximately 1,300 slot and video poker machines; approximately 37 table games, including blackjack, craps, roulette, and others; a race and sports book; a 24-hour live keno lounge; and a poker room. The Atlantis also offers a mobile race and sports betting app which is available to patrons who are physically located within the state of Nevada.
​
Through an enclosed skywalk, Atlantis is the only hotel facility to be physically connected to the Reno-Sparks Convention Center. The Reno-Sparks Convention Center offers approximately 500,000 square feet of leasable exhibition, meeting room, ballroom and lobby space.
​
Operations at the Atlantis are conducted 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Business is seasonal in nature, with higher revenues during the summer months and lower revenues during the winter months.
​
Atlantis Casino. The Atlantis offers what we believe to be higher than average payout rates on slot machines relative to other Northern Nevada casinos. We seek to attract high-end players through high quality amenities and services and by extension of gaming credit after a careful credit history evaluation.
​
Hotel and Spa. The Atlantis includes three contiguous high-rise hotel towers with a total of 817 rooms, more than 100 of which are suites. The rooms on the top seven floors in the third tower are nearly 20% larger than the standard guest rooms and offer restricted elevator access, and a private concierge service.
​
The Atlantis hotel rooms feature high end design and furnishings as well as nine-foot ceilings, which create an open and spacious feel. The third hotel tower features a four-story waterfall with an adjacent year-round swimming pool in a climate controlled, five-story glass enclosure, which shares an outdoor pool deck with a seasonal outdoor swimming pool and year-round whirlpool. The Salon at Atlantis is a full-service salon overlooking the third-floor sundeck and outdoor seasonal swimming pool and offers salon-grade products and treatments for hair, nails and skincare for both men and women. Our Spa Atlantis is a high-end health spa located adjacent to the swimming area that offers treatments and amenities unique to our market. The hotel rooms on the spa floor feature décor that is themed consistent with the spa. The hotel features glass elevators that rise the full 19 and 28 stories of the respective towers providing panoramic views of the Reno area and the Sierra Nevada mountain range.

Acquisition, Improvements and Additional Expansion Potential
​
We seek to identify and evaluate strategic expansion and acquisition opportunities through market and detailed financial analyses. We develop overall master plans and then aim to execute each phase of the master plan after re-evaluation of the current market conditions and comparison against other capital investment opportunities.
​
We have continuously invested in upgrading our facilities. Capital expenditures were $48.4 million in 2022, $37.8 million in 2021 and $46.4 million in 2020. During the last three years, capital expenditures related primarily to: the transformation of part of the Monarch Black Hawk legacy facility; the major redesign and upgrade of all hotel rooms in the first tower and complete renovation of the high-end suites on the top floors of the hotel tower at Atlantis; the new upscale retail shop at Atlantis; the new Red Bloom Asian kitchen at Atlantis; the redesign and upgrade of the Atrium bar at Atlantis; the ongoing capital maintenance spending; and the acquisition of gaming equipment at both of our properties.
​
We have two potential options for expansion at our Atlantis property. First, we could further expand our existing hotel and casino, thereby providing more hotel rooms, casino floor space, restaurants and other amenities. Second, we could develop the 16-acre parcel of land that we own across South Virginia Street from the Atlantis. This site is connected to the Atlantis by the Sky Terrace and is currently used for surface parking and special events related to the Atlantis. Our 16-acre parcel of land meets all current Reno zoning requirements in the event we decide to build another resort casino or entertainment facility. We also own additional land adjacent to our two large sites that would facilitate expansion opportunities through administrative and other non-operational uses.
​
On August 28, 2015, we entered into a 20-year lease (the “Parking Lot Lease”) with Biggest Little Investments, L.P. (“BLI”) with respect to a portion of the shopping center adjacent to the Atlantis property (the “Shopping Center”). The Parking Lot Lease covering approximately 4.2 acres is used for approximately 300 additional convenient surface parking spaces for Atlantis guests. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; See also NOTE 12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS.
​
Marketing Strategy
​
Reno/Sparks. Our marketing efforts are directed toward three broad consumer groups: leisure travelers, conventioneers and Northern Nevada local residents.
​
The Reno/Sparks region is a major gaming and leisure destination with aggregate gaming revenues of approximately $917 million (as reported by the Nevada Gaming Control Board for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022).
​
Our Atlantis revenues and operating income are principally dependent on the level of gaming activity at the Atlantis casino. Our predominant marketing goal is to utilize all of the Atlantis amenities to generate additional casino play. Our secondary goal is to maximize revenues from our hotel, food and beverage, spa, convention and meeting rooms, retail and other amenities.
​
We believe the Atlantis’ location south of downtown Reno (near the airport, near major freeway arteries and physically connected to the Reno-Sparks Convention Center) makes the facility appealing to all three groups.
​
Leisure Travelers: The Reno/Tahoe region is a popular gaming and vacation destination. The principal segments of Reno’s leisure traveler market are independent travelers, package tour and travel guests, guests we reach through internet-based marketing and high-end players. We attempt to maximize our gaming revenues and hotel occupancy through a balanced marketing approach that addresses each market segment.
​
Independent travelers generally make reservations directly with hotels of their choice, through independent travel agents or through the internet. We strive to attract the middle to upper-middle income strata of this consumer segment through advertising and direct marketing. This segment represents a large portion of the Atlantis’ guests.
​

The package tour and travel segment consists of visitors who utilize travel packages offered by wholesale operators. We market to this segment through relationships with select wholesalers, primarily to generate guest visits and supplement mid-week occupancy.
​
We welcome domestic and international reservations on the Atlantis’ website (www.atlantiscasino.com), and we are featured on major package tour and travel websites.
​
We market to high-end players selectively through direct marketing and hosts. We utilize complimentary rooms, food and beverage, special events and the extension of gaming credit to attract and maintain patronage from high-end players.
​
Conventioneers: Convention business, like package tour and travel business, supplements occupancy during lower-demand periods. Conventioneers also typically pay higher average room rates than non-conventioneers. We selectively seek convention and meeting groups that we believe will materially enhance the Atlantis’ occupancy and daily room rates, as well as those we believe will be more likely to utilize our gaming products. This segment was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and still has not recovered to the pre-pandemic level. We believe that the segment will normalize in the near future. We are the only hotel-casino physically connected to the Reno-Sparks Convention Center. In our view, Atlantis is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this segment. We believe the Reno-Sparks Convention Center has created, and we expect will continue to create, additional guest traffic for the Atlantis within this market segment that is presently underserved in the Reno area.
​
We market to all guest segments, including conventioneers, on the basis of the location, quality and ambiance of the Atlantis facility, gaming values, friendly, efficient service, and the quality and relative value of Atlantis rooms, food and beverage offerings, entertainment and promotions.
​
Northern Nevada Residents: We market to Northern Nevada residents on the basis of the Atlantis’ location and accessibility, convenient surface parking, gaming values, ambiance, friendly efficient service, exceptional quality of food and beverage offerings.
​
Black Hawk.  Our marketing efforts are directed toward patrons from the Denver metropolitan area and Colorado mountain areas. Black Hawk, Colorado is approximately 40 miles west of Denver.
​
The Denver metro area is an attractive market with a population of more than three million and a healthy population growth of 16.9% from 2010 to 2021 (national average is 7.5%). Denver metro area per capita personal income in 2020 was 17% higher than the national average ($69,822 vs. $59,510).
​
Commercial gaming in Colorado is constitutionally restricted to three mountain towns – Black Hawk, Central City and Cripple Creek – which in 2022 represented 77%, 8% and 15% of total Colorado gaming revenue, respectively (Colorado Division of Gaming statistical summaries). These state constitutional limitations and the scarcity of available and developable land in Black Hawk create a strong barrier to new entries in the gaming market, limiting the threat of potential new competition.
​
The Black Hawk/Central City area gaming market generated approximately $781 million in gaming revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, according to the Colorado Division of Gaming.
​
Our Monarch Black Hawk revenues and operating income are principally dependent on the level of gaming activity in the Black Hawk market. Leveraging our premium location, product and service, we are determined to continue to grow market share by attracting not only Black Hawk gaming guests, but by introducing our new luxurious resort to attract new guests to the market and our property. Our superior lodging, spa and dining products are predominantly intended to drive gaming revenue.
​

7




Our cross-property players’ club, “Monarch Rewards,” allows our guests to be eligible to receive rewards and privileges based on the amount of their gaming play and non-gaming spend at both properties, while allowing us to track play patterns through a computerized system. We use this information to determine appropriate levels of complimentary awards and to guide our direct marketing efforts. We believe that Monarch Rewards significantly enhances our ability to build guest loyalty and generate repeat and cross property guest visits.
​
Competition
​
Reno/Sparks. Gaming competition in the Reno area is intense. Based on information obtained from the December 31, 2022 Gaming Revenue Report published by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, there are approximately 15 casinos in the Reno-Sparks area which each generated more than $12.0 million in annual gaming revenues.
​
We believe that the Atlantis’ primary competition for leisure travelers comes from other large-scale casinos that offer amenities that appeal to middle to upper-middle income guests. We believe that some of our competitors have the advantage of having significantly more guest rooms available for sale than we do. We compete for leisure travelers on the basis of the desirability of our location, the quality and ambiance of the Atlantis facility, friendly and efficient service, the quality and relative value of our rooms, food and beverage offerings, entertainment offerings, promotions and gaming values. We believe that our location away from downtown Reno is appealing to first-time and more affluent guests.
​
We believe that the Atlantis’ primary competition for conventioneers comes from other large-scale hotel casinos in the Reno area that actively target the convention market segment, and from other cities in the western United States with large convention facilities and substantial hotel capacity, including Las Vegas. We believe that some of our competitors have the advantage of having significantly more guest rooms available for sale than we do. We compete for conventioneers based on the desirability of our location, the quality and ambiance of the Atlantis facility, meeting and banquet rooms designed to appeal to conventions and groups, friendly and efficient service, and the quality and relative value of our rooms and food and beverage offerings. We believe that the Atlantis’ proximity to the Reno-Sparks Convention Center, and the enclosed pedestrian sky bridge that connects the Atlantis directly with the Reno-Sparks Convention Center facilities, afford us a distinct competitive advantage in attracting conventioneers.
​
We believe that the Atlantis’ competition for local guests comes primarily from other large-scale casinos located outside of downtown Reno that offer amenities that appeal to middle to upper-middle income guests, and secondarily with those casinos located in downtown Reno that offer similar amenities. We compete for local guests primarily on the basis of the desirability of our location, the quality and ambiance of the Atlantis facility, friendly and efficient service, the quality and relative value of our food and beverage offerings, entertainment offerings, promotions and gaming values. We believe the Atlantis’ proximity to residential areas in south Reno and its abundant surface parking provide us an advantage over the casinos located in downtown Reno in attracting local guests.
​
The Atlantis also competes for gaming guests with hotel casino operations located in other parts of Nevada, especially Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe, and with hotel casinos located elsewhere throughout the United States and the world. Major Native American owned facilities in California have been very successful, adversely impacting many hotel casinos in Reno. We believe that the Atlantis also competes to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors and other forms of legalized gaming, particularly in northern California and the Pacific Northwest. We believe our numerous amenities, such as a wide array of restaurants, banquet facilities, spa and surface parking are key advantages in our ability to attract local guests that competitor facilities cannot easily match without significant capital expenditures.
​
We also believe that the legalization of additional land-based casino gaming in or near any major metropolitan area in the Atlantis’ feeder markets, such as San Francisco or Sacramento, could have a material adverse impact on our business.
​

8




The legalization of internet poker, sports betting and other forms of internet gaming in additional jurisdictions throughout the United States could create further competition for the Atlantis.
​
Black Hawk. There is strong competition in the concentrated Black Hawk/Central City area gaming market, which includes approximately 21 casinos as of December 31, 2022, according to the Colorado Division of Gaming report.
​
The Black Hawk and Central City gaming markets are geographically isolated. The only other non-tribal gaming market is Cripple Creek, which is seventy-five miles away. There are two federally recognized tribes in southwest Colorado, both with gaming facilities, and both more than 350 miles from Denver. There have been proposals for the development of Native American racetrack and video lottery terminal casinos throughout the state over the years. On two occasions the owners of the Arapahoe Race Track, southeast of Denver, have funded state wide ballot initiatives to allow casino style gaming at the race track. On both occasions, these measures were voted down by the electorate by wide margins. As of December 31, 2022, none of the proposals have been adopted by the state’s electorate or by the legislature. Should any form of additional gaming be authorized in the Denver metropolitan area, the Black Hawk and Central City markets would be adversely affected.
​
We believe that the Monarch Black Hawk’s primary competition for visitors comes from other large-scale casinos in the market which offer amenities that appeal to the guests’ entire vacation experience including hotel, broad dining choices, as well as other amenities. We compete for patrons on the basis of the desirability of our location, which is the first casino encountered when entering the area on the main thoroughfare, as well as the attractive setting, friendly and efficient service, quality of our new hotel, spa and food and beverage offerings. Our resort now offers 516 guest rooms and suites, additional bars and dining options, banquet and meeting room space, a retail store, a concierge lounge and an upscale spa and pool facility located on the top floor of the tower.
​
Regulation and Licensing
​
We may not own, manage or operate a gaming facility unless we obtain proper licenses, registrations, permits and approvals. Applications for a license permit or approval may generally be denied for reasonable cause. Most regulatory authorities license, investigate, and determine the suitability of any person who has a material relationship with us. Persons having material relationships include officers, directors, employees, and certain security holders. We believe that we have obtained, applied for, or are in the process of applying for all necessary registrations, approvals, permits, licenses, and findings of suitability with respect to such persons affiliated with our licensed gaming operations, although the gaming authorities, in their discretion, may require additional persons to file applications for findings of suitability.
​
Licenses, permits, and approvals are revocable privileges, which are not transferable. Regulatory authorities may at any time revoke, suspend, condition, limit, or restrict a license for reasonable cause. License holders may be fined and, in some jurisdictions and under certain circumstances, gaming operation revenues can be forfeited. We may be unable to obtain any licenses, permits, or approvals, or if obtained, they may not be renewed or may be revoked in the future. In addition, a rejection or termination of a license, permit, or approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect in other jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions require gaming operators licensed in that state to receive their permission before conducting gaming in other jurisdictions.
​
In each jurisdiction in which we have gaming operations, the following conditions and restrictions apply:
​

● | Periodic license fees and taxes must be paid to state and local gaming authorities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Certain officers, directors, key employees, and gaming employees are required to be licensed or otherwise approved by the gaming authorities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Individuals who must be approved by a gaming authority must submit comprehensive personal disclosure forms and undergo an exhaustive background investigation, the costs for which must be borne by the applicant;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9





● | Changes in any licensed or approved individuals must be reported to and/or approved by the relevant gaming authority;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Failure to timely file the required application forms by any individual required to be approved by the relevant gaming authority may result in that individual’s denial and the gaming licensee may be required by the gaming authority to disassociate with that individual; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If any individual is found unsuitable by a gaming authority, the gaming licensee is required to disassociate with that individual.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Nevada. The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in Nevada are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, referred to as the “Nevada Act,” and various local regulations. Our gaming operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada Gaming Commission, the Nevada Gaming Control Board, and the Reno City Council, referred to collectively as the “Nevada Gaming Authorities.”
​
The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with, among other things:
​

● | the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having a direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices and procedures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues, providing reliable record keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | the provision of a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Changes in such laws, regulations and procedures could have an adverse effect on our gaming operations.
​
Golden Road Motor Inn, Inc. (“Golden Road”), our subsidiary which operates the Atlantis, is required to be licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. We are registered by the Nevada Gaming Commission as a publicly traded corporation, or “Registered Corporation.” As such, we are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Gaming Commission and to furnish any other information that the Nevada Gaming Commission may require. Substantially all material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by us must be reported to, or approved by, the Nevada Gaming Authorities. No person may become a major stockholder of, or receive any percentage of profits from Golden Road without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Nevada Gaming Authorities.
​
The Nevada Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of Monarch’s voting securities to report the acquisition to the Nevada Gaming Commission. The Nevada Act requires that beneficial owners of more than 10% of our voting securities apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a finding of suitability. The Nevada Gaming Commission may also, in its discretion, require any other holders of our debt or equity securities to file applications to be found suitable to own the debt or equity securities. The applicant must pay all costs of investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any investigation. 
​
We are subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with us, we:
​
●pay that person any dividend or interest upon voting securities;
●allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person;
●pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or
●fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his voting securities for cash at fair market value.
​

10




Under certain circumstances, an “institutional investor,” as defined in the Nevada Act, which acquires more than 10%, but not more than 25%, of our voting securities may apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a waiver of such finding of suitability if the institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. 
​
Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Gaming Commission or the Chair of the Nevada Gaming Control Board may be found unsuitable.
​
We are required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada, and the Nevada Gaming Authorities may examine the ledger at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. We are also required to render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner. The Nevada Gaming Commission may require our stock certificates to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to the Nevada Act.
​
We may not make a public offering of our securities without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission if the securities or proceeds therefrom are intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for purposes of constructing, acquiring or financing gaming facilities. Any approval, if granted, does not constitute a finding, recommendation or approval by the Nevada Gaming Authorities as to the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or the investment merits of the securities offered.
​
Changes in our control through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or any act or conduct by a person whereby that person obtains control (including foreclosure on the pledged shares), may not occur without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Entities seeking to acquire control of a Registered Corporation must satisfy the Nevada Gaming Authorities in a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control of such Registered Corporation. The Nevada Gaming Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed or found suitable as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.
​
The Nevada Legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defense tactics affecting Nevada gaming licensees, and Registered Corporations that are affiliated with those operations, may be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Nevada Gaming Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada’s gaming industry and to further Nevada’s policy to:
​

● | assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.

We are, in certain circumstances, required to receive approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above their current market price and before we can consummate a corporate acquisition opposed by management. The Nevada Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by the board of directors in response to a tender offer made directly to a Registered Corporation’s stockholders for the purposes of acquiring control of the Registered Corporation.
​
Licensee fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the counties and cities in which the Nevada licensee’s respective operations are conducted. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon either:

● | a percentage of the gross revenues received;
--+---------------------------------------------

11





● | the number of gaming devices operated; or
--+------------------------------------------


● | the number of table games operated.
--+------------------------------------

​
A live entertainment tax is also paid on admission charges where entertainment is furnished. Nevada licensees that hold a license as an operator of a slot route, a manufacturer or a distributor also pay certain fees and taxes to the State of Nevada.
​
Any person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered, required to be registered, or is under common control with such persons, referred to as “Licensees,” and who is or proposes to become involved in a gaming venture outside of Nevada is required to deposit with the Nevada Gaming Control Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation by the Nevada Gaming Control Board of their participation in foreign gaming. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease in the discretion of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Thereafter, Licensees are required to comply with certain reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Act. Licensees are also subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Gaming Commission if they knowingly violate any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation, fail to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations, engage in activities that are harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to collect gaming taxes and fees, or employ a person in the foreign operation who has been denied a license or finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of personal unsuitability.
​
Colorado. As prescribed by the Colorado Limited Gaming Act with Constitutional Amendment of 2021 (the “Colorado Act”), the ownership and operation of limited stakes gaming facilities in Colorado are subject to the Colorado Gaming Rules and Regulations (the “Colorado Regulations”) and final authority of the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission (the “Colorado Commission”). The Colorado Act also created the Colorado Division of Gaming within the Colorado Department of Revenue to license, supervise and enforce the conduct of limited stakes gaming in Colorado.
​
The Colorado Act declares public policy on limited stakes gaming to be that: (1) the success of limited stakes gaming is dependent upon public confidence and trust that licensed limited stakes gaming is conducted honestly and competitively, the rights of the creditors of licensees are protected and gaming is free from criminal and corruptive elements; (2) public confidence and trust can be maintained only by strict regulation of all persons, locations, practices, associations and activities related to the operation of licensed gaming establishments and the manufacture or distribution of gaming devices and equipment; (3) all establishments where limited gaming is conducted and where gambling devices are operated, and all manufacturers, sellers and distributors of certain gambling devices and equipment, must therefore be licensed, controlled and assisted to protect the public health, safety, good order and the general welfare of the inhabitants of the state to foster the stability and success of limited stakes gaming and to preserve the economy, policies and free competition in Colorado; and (4) no applicant for a license or other affirmative Colorado Commission approval has any right to a license or to the granting of the approval sought. With limited exceptions applicable to licensees that are publicly traded entities, no person may sell, lease, purchase, convey or acquire any interest in a retail gaming or operator license or business without the prior approval of the Colorado Commission.
​
In November 2020, Colorado voters passed Amendment 77 to the State Constitution (“Amendment 77”) allowing voters in Central City, Black Hawk, and Cripple Creek to approve a maximum single bet of any amount, compared to the previous $100 per bet limit that was in place and add additional game types beyond slot machines, blackjack, poker, roulette, and craps. The measure permitted each of the three towns to hold a local election on whether to change betting limits and/or add new games. Concurrently with the November 2020 election, Black Hawk voters passed such a local ballot measure, and the Black Hawk City Council followed shortly thereafter by approving unrestricted single bet limits and new popular table games. Those changes went into effect on May 1, 2021 and Black Hawk casinos are now operating without betting limit restrictions and can add to their table games mix Pai Gow, Baccarat, Keno, and Big 6 Wheel.

Limited stakes gaming is confined to the commercial districts of these cities as defined by Central City on October 7, 1981, by Black Hawk on May 4, 1978, and by Cripple Creek on December 3, 1973. In addition, the Colorado law restricts limited stakes gaming to structures that conform to the architectural styles and designs that were common to the areas prior to World War I and that conform to the requirements of applicable city ordinances regardless of the age of the structures. Under the 1990 Colorado Amendment, no more than 35% of the square footage of any building and no more than 50% of any one floor of any building may be used for limited stakes gaming. Persons under the age of 21 cannot participate in limited stakes gaming. The Colorado Constitution provides for a tax on the total amount wagered less all payouts to players at graduated annual rates. The gaming tax rates in effect as of July 1, 2008 can only be increased by amendment to the Colorado Constitution by voters in a statewide election. With respect to games of poker, the tax is calculated based on the sums wagered that are retained by the licensee as compensation, which must be consistent with the minimum and maximum amounts established by the Colorado Commission. The graduated rates effective as of July 1, 2012 are:
​

● | 0.25% up to and including $2 million of the subject amounts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | 2.0% on amounts from $2 million to $5 million;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | 9.0% on amounts from $5 million to $8 million;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | 11.0% on amounts from $8 million to $10 million;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | 16.0% on amounts from $10 million to $13 million; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | 20.0% on amounts over $13 million.
--+-----------------------------------

​
The City of Black Hawk also assesses monthly device fees that are based on the number of gaming devices operated. These consist of an $87.50 fee per slot device, $350.00 per table device, and transportation fee of $3.68 for each slots device and $14.72 for each table device and sports betting device.
​
The Colorado Commission has enacted Rule 4.5, which imposes requirements on publicly traded corporations holding gaming licenses in Colorado and on gaming licenses owned directly or indirectly by a publicly traded corporation, whether through a subsidiary or intermediary company. Such requirements automatically apply to any ownership interest held by a publicly traded corporation, holding company or intermediary company thereof, where the ownership interest directly or indirectly is, or will be upon approval of the Colorado Commission, 5% or more of the entire licensee. In any event, if the Colorado Commission determines that a publicly traded corporation or a subsidiary, intermediary company or holding company has the actual ability to exercise influence over a licensee, regardless of the percentage of ownership possessed by such entity, the Colorado Commission may require the entity to comply with the disclosure rules and regulations contained in Rule 4.5.
​
Under Rule 4.5, gaming licensees, affiliated companies and controlling persons commencing a public offering of voting securities must notify the Colorado Commission no later than 10 business days after the initial filing of a registration statement with the SEC. Licensed publicly traded corporations are also required to send proxy statements to the Division of Gaming within five days after their distribution. Licensees to whom Rule 4.5 applies must include in their charter documents provisions that restrict the rights of the licensees to issue voting interests or securities except in accordance with the Colorado Act and the Colorado Regulations; limit the rights of persons to transfer voting interests or securities of licensees except in accordance with the Colorado Act and the Colorado Regulations; and provide that holders of voting interests or securities of licensees found unsuitable by the Colorado Commission may, within 60 days of such finding of unsuitability, be required to sell their interests or securities back to the issuer at the lesser of the cash equivalent of the holders’ investment or the market price as of the date of the finding of unsuitability. Alternatively, the holders may, within 60 days after the finding of unsuitability, transfer the voting interests or securities to a suitable person, as determined by the Colorado Commission. Until the voting interests or securities are held by suitable persons, the issuer may not pay dividends or interest, the securities may not be voted and may not be included in the voting or securities of the issuer, and the issuer may not pay any remuneration in any form to the holders of the securities.

Pursuant to Rule 4.5, persons who acquire direct or indirect beneficial ownership of (a) 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a publicly traded corporation that is required to include in its articles of incorporation the Rule 4.5 charter language provisions; or (b) 5% or more of the beneficial interest in a gaming licensee directly or indirectly through any class of voting securities of any holding company or intermediary company of a licensee, referred to as “qualifying persons,” shall notify the Division of Gaming within 10 days of such acquisition and submit all requested information. Such persons are subject to a finding of suitability as required by the Division of Gaming or the Colorado Commission. Licensees also must notify any qualifying persons of these requirements. A qualifying person other than an institutional investor whose interest equals 10% or more must apply to the Colorado Commission for a finding of suitability within 45 days after acquiring such securities. Licensees must also notify any qualifying persons of these requirements. Whether or not notified, qualifying persons are responsible for complying with these requirements.
​
A qualifying person who is an institutional investor under Rule 4.5 and who, individually or in association with others, acquires, directly or indirectly, the beneficial ownership of 20% or more of any class of voting securities must apply to the Colorado Commission for a finding of suitability within 45 days after acquiring such interests.
​
The Colorado Regulations provide for exemption from the requirements for a finding of suitability when the Colorado Commission finds such action to be consistent with the purposes of the Colorado Act.
​
The Colorado Regulations require that every officer, director and stockholder of private corporations or equivalent office or ownership holders for non-corporate applicants, and every officer, director or stockholder holding either a 5% or greater interest or controlling interest of a publicly traded corporation or owners of an applicant or licensee, shall be a person of good moral character and submit to a full background investigation conducted by the Division of Gaming and the Colorado Commission. The Colorado Commission may require any person having an interest in a license to undergo a full background investigation and pay the cost of investigation in the same manner as an applicant.
​
The sale of alcoholic beverages in gaming establishments is subject to strict licensing, control and regulation by state and local authorities. Alcoholic beverage licenses are revocable and nontransferable. State and local licensing authorities have full power to limit, condition, suspend for as long as six months or revoke any such licenses.
​
There are various classes of retail liquor licenses which may be issued under the Colorado Liquor Code. A gaming licensee may sell malt, vinous or spirituous liquors only by the individual drink for consumption on the premises. An application for an alcoholic beverage license in Colorado requires notice, posting and a public hearing before the local liquor licensing authority prior to approval. The Colorado Department of Revenue’s Liquor Enforcement Division must also approve the application. Monarch Black Hawk has been approved for a restaurant liquor license by both the local Black Hawk licensing authority and the State Division of Liquor Enforcement.
​
In November 2019, Proposition DD was passed with a vote of the people allowing for legalizing sports betting in Colorado, making Colorado one of many states now letting people place bets on sporting events since the Supreme Court ruling struck down a law that banned sports betting in most U.S. states. With the passage of Proposition DD, and the legislative bill passed by the Colorado General Assembly in May 2019 (the “Colorado Sports Act”), the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission and the Colorado Division of Gaming are the statutory authority over the regulation of the legalized sports betting in Colorado. The Colorado Sports Act establishes three categories of sports wagering licenses: (1) Master License (awarded to casinos to offer both retail and online sports betting), (2) Sports Betting Operator (awarded to the operator running an on-premise sports book at the casino), and (3) Internet Sports Betting Operator. The Colorado Commission approved Sports Betting Rule 3, effective March 16, 2020, to enable applications, investigations, and licensure as related to sports betting. Rule 3 authorizes the additional license classifications Vendor Major License and Vendor Minor License. On February 20, 2020, Monarch Black Hawk was issued a Master License.

On February 20, 2020, the Colorado Commission voted unanimously to approve the new Sports Betting Rules and Regulations. Authorized sports betting includes (1) any individual or team sport or athletic event in which the outcome is not determined solely by chance, whether amateur or professional, including an Olympic or international sport or athletic event and any collegiate sports event (2) any portion of an authorized sport or athletic event, including the individual performance statistics of athletes in a sports event or combination of sports events, and (3) an authorized sanctioned motor sport. Sports’ betting is prohibited on a high school sports event, a video game that is not sanctioned by a sports’ governing body or equivalent as an electronic competition or proposition bets on collegiate sports. Sports’ betting went live in Colorado on May 1, 2020. Sports betting is allowed in Colorado casinos as well as approved mobile apps provided the bettor is within the State of Colorado while the bet is made.

Compliance with Environmental Laws
​
In 2022, the Company did not incur any material capital expenses for maintaining compliance with applicable environmental laws and does not expect to incur such in 2023. 
​
Requirements to comply with environmental laws may have an impact on capital expenditures, earnings, and our competitive position in the future. See Item 1A, “RISK FACTORS.”
​
Human Capital
​
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 2,700 employees across both properties.
​
We believe that our team is the most important asset in our organization. During the pandemic period, our team members worked together to navigate through the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the period our operations at both properties were suspended for approximately three months, some team members were temporarily furloughed, but no team member was laid off. The Company continued to provide benefits, including medical, dental and vision insurance, throughout the suspension period. After resuming operations and welcoming our team members back to the properties, the health and wellbeing of our team members has been our priority.
​
Our management focus is on employee retention and we use retention rate to evaluate it. We also perform “exit interviews” for employees exiting the company, to understand better what matters most to our team members and improve our polices. 
​
We offer to our team members an extensive series of Leadership Development Workshops to support our team members’ professional and career development.
​
The Company regularly conducts diversity and inclusion training for its team members as part of new-hire onboarding and ongoing team member/leadership education sessions.  
​
We continuously work on enhancing employee benefits and provide to our employees benefit packages which are competitive to the market and industry. The Company also offers team members up to $6,000 in annual tuition reimbursement for educational courses and/or certifications related to their performance.
