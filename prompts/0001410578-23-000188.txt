Biopharma/Pharma. In the biopharma/pharma market, we are focused on supporting biopharma/pharma companies, primarily, in the saving of lives. From clinical research and development to clinical research organizations, to clinical trials for cell and gene therapies, to the storage and delivery of life-saving commercial cell and gene therapies, to the customers of biopharmaceutical /pharmaceutical organizations, to crucial points of care, we strive to address fundamental to advanced temperature-controlled storage, transport, packaging, fulfillment, and information challenges. Cell and gene therapies have become a rapidly growing area of biological drug development, with over $12 billion in funding raised in 2022. There were 1,457 cell and gene therapy developers worldwide, as reported by the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine (ARM) in its State of the Industry Briefing published on January 9, 2023. These developers have certain supply chain challenges that we believe our solutions are well tailored to address. 

● | Cell Therapies. As per ARM, cell therapy is “the administration of viable, often purified cells into a patient’s body to grow, replace, or repair damaged tissue for the treatment of a disease. Cell therapies may be autologous, meaning that the patient receives cells from their own body, or they may be allogeneic, meaning the patient receives cells from a donor. Allogeneic cell therapies are often referred to as off-the-shelf therapies, as they are derived from a donor who is not the patient, enabling advance preparation and available to the patient immediately at the time of need.”
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Gene Therapies. As per ARM, “gene therapy seeks to modify or introduce genes into a patient’s body with the goal of durably treating, preventing, or potentially even curing disease, including several types of cancer, viral diseases, and inherited disorders.”
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Animal Health. In the animal health market, we provide support for animal reproduction, which primarily involves the production of protein. We also support medicine for the health of recreational and companion animals. Animal disease prevention and control rely on the safe transport and storage of vaccines and other biological materials around the world. Our secure temperature-controlled supply chain solutions are designed to help avoid costly delays through nonstop monitoring and complete fleet management from and to the origin and destination points as well as provide cryobiological storage equipment.
Reproductive Medicine. In the human reproductive medicine market, we are focused on supporting the creation of human life. This is primarily accomplished by supporting IVF, and related technologies, along with fertility networks globally. IVF materials receive one-on-one handling and individualized attention during the entire logistics process.

Competitive Advantages
With our first-to-market integrated platform of technology-driven supply chain solutions serving the life sciences industry, we have established a substantial lead over potential competitors by focusing on de-risking critical processes central to the manufacture of cell and gene therapies. Working with our in-depth knowledge of information technology, cryopreservation, packaging, temperature-controlled logistics, bioservices, and cryogenic systems, our management, technical, business development and service support teams approach our growing markets with valued insights, adaptability, innovation, creative thinking and a mindset of problem resolution which will provide clients with certainty of performance.
The most common alternatives to Cryoport’s platform of solutions are “older technologies” and/or systems as well as partial, non-integrated and/or non-regulated, non-validated solutions. In fact, a portion of the biopharma market and much of the animal health and reproductive medicine markets still use liquid nitrogen and/or dry ice with no monitoring or ongoing validation processes for equipment and/or procedures. Non-integrated systems with assets and technologies managed by multiple entities introduce gaps in policies, procedures, information, and validation of the supply chain solutions which in turn create inherent and material risks during the biostorage, packaging, fulfillment, information gathering, transport processes and other related activities required to securely deliver biopharma products and services in the life sciences. 
Through our experience, we know that supply chain processes can have a large impact on temperature sensitive product/commodity conditions. This is especially important for high value, and, at times, irreplaceable commodities for which we provide products and services, whether in support of research, clinical trials or commercial distribution. We therefore seek to exceed the most demanding standards in the industry, e.g., ISO 13485, ISO 21973, ISO 9001, STA (International Safe Transit Association), IATA (International Air Transport Association), to name a few.
Throughout our company, we have implemented Quality-by-Design processes that allow us to assess internal and in-field events including the impact of packaging and supply chain processes and procedures on the commodity being shipped, and the equipment being used for each individual shipment. With the acquisition of CRYOPDP, Cryoport now has increasing control and accountability around distribution which in turn provides better performance and risk management for our clients and their critical therapies. We have been qualified as a trusted temperature-controlled solutions provider for hundreds of life sciences companies, institutions, and governments. We supported 654 clinical trials in the regenerative medicine space as of December 31, 2022. Cryoport and CRYOPDP have logged over 500,000 shipments to over 100 countries with hundreds of different types of life sciences materials in the last 12 months.
Cryoport Systems’ Cryoportal® Logistics Management System (Cryoportal®) is an important backbone technology that is integrated with our partners, such as FedEx, UPS, DHL, Be-The-Match Biotherapies, Lonza, and others. The Cryoportal® Logistics Management System handles order entry, keeps track of our global inventory, and provides algorithms for predictive analysis on every shipment while in transit, globally. Cryoport Systems’ customer service team monitors every in-transit shipment 24/7/365 and, by leveraging the Cryoportal®, they have the unique ability to see issues that arise and take corrective measures up to and including intervention to potentially save a shipment in trouble.
Embedded within the Cryoportal® is our Chain of Compliance®, which is important for regulatory reasons and risk mitigation to our processes. Each of our reusable products, including every Cryoport Express® and ELITE™ shipper and every SmartPak® Condition Monitoring System, has a unique ID attached for its entire life. Thereby, Cryoport personnel can pull any Cryoport shipper out of our fleet and provide customers and/or regulatory agencies with its (and all its components) entire history including every journey it has taken, for whom it was shipped, the contents shipped, the Cryoport shipper’s performance during transit, and the time of its return to a Cryoport Systems’ Global Logistics facility. It also provides technician log information on the validated cleaning process, recertification process of the unit and its components, and recalibration of the SmartPak® Condition Monitoring System as being acceptable for its next use. All this traceability is securely stored in our Cryoportal® Logistics Management System for our clients to access at any time. We believe that this represents a significant differentiator for Cryoport in the markets it serves.

Segment Reporting
The Company continually monitors and reviews its segment reporting structure in accordance with authoritative guidance to determine whether any changes have occurred that would impact its reportable operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. The chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is our Chief Executive Officer. Up until the fourth quarter of 2020, we managed, reported and evaluated our business in the following two reportable operating segments: Global Logistics Solutions and Global Bioservices. During the fourth quarter of 2020, our CODM changed how he makes operating decisions, assesses the performance of the business and allocates resources in a manner that caused our operating segments to change as a result of the MVE Biological Solutions and CRYOPDP acquisitions. In consideration of Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), Segment Reporting, we determined that we are not organized around specific products and services, geographic regions, or regulatory environments. Accordingly, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2020, we realigned our reporting structure, resulting in a single reportable segment. The Company has adjusted its financial statements for historical periods to reflect this change in segment reporting and show its financial results without segments for all periods presented. See Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Form 10-K for further discussion.
Customers and Distribution
As a result of growing globalization in cell and gene therapy (regenerative medicine), biologics, biopharma, biotechnology, clinical trials, distribution of biopharmaceutical products, animal health and reproductive medicine, the requirement for effective and reliable solutions for keeping clinical samples, pharmaceutical products and other specimen at controlled temperatures requires more sophisticated supply chain solutions in areas such as distribution, complex shipping routes, extended shipping times, potential custom delays, general logistics challenges, biostorage, etc. We believe that our platform of temperature-controlled supply chain solutions, expertise, and geographic footprint enables us to take advantage of the growing demand for effective and efficient global transport and biostorage of temperature sensitive life sciences commodities. This is especially the case for the new therapies being developed in the regenerative medicine market, such as autologous and allogeneic CAR T-cell therapies, that require tightly controlled temperatures through the development, biostorage, transportation, and delivery processes to maintain efficacy and safety.
During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, no single customer accounted for over 10% of our total revenues.
Our geographical revenues, by origin, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were as follows:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
------------------------------------------+---+------+---+------+---+------+--

Customer types
Our major customer types include:
Clinical Trials - Every pharmaceutical or biopharma company developing a new drug or therapy must seek development protocol approval by regulatory bodies, e.g., the FDA or EMA. Usually, these agencies require clinical trials to be designed to test the safety and efficacy of the potential new drug or therapy among other things. Importantly, clinical trial specimens are often irreplaceable because each one represents clinical data at a prescribed point in time, in a series of specimens on a given patient, who may be participating in a trial for up to several years. Sample integrity and information gathering during the transportation and biostorage process is vital to retaining patients in each trial and staying on schedule.
Biotechnology and Diagnostic Companies - The biotechnology market includes basic and applied research and development in diverse areas such as stem cells, gene therapy, DNA tumor vaccines, tissue engineering, genomics, blood products, etc. Companies participating in the foregoing fields rely on temperature-controlled storage and transport of specimens in connection with their research and development efforts, for which our suite of global temperature-controlled supply chain solutions are ideally suited.
Cell Therapy Companies - Rapid advancements are underway in the research and development of cell-based therapies, which involve cellular material being infused into a patient. In allogeneic cell therapies, the donor is a different person than the recipient of the cells. Autologous cell therapy is a personalized therapeutic intervention that uses an individual’s cells, which are cultured and expanded outside the body, and reintroduced into the individual. Once cells are manufactured into a cellular therapy, in either case, they must be stored and shipped cryogenically for which our Cryoport Express® and Cryoport ELITE™ Shipper solutions, CRYOPDP logistics solutions, CRYOGENE’s biostorage capabilities, and MVE Biological Solutions’ cryogenic systems are ideally suited.
Contract Research, Development & Manufacturing Companies - Increasingly, as evidenced by our strategic partnership with Lonza, CRO’s and Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (“CDMOs”) are engaging our services exclusively in conjunction with their contract services platform to provide a higher level of service to our mutual client base. We anticipate that these relationships, which are mutually beneficial to both parties as well as our client base, will accelerate and expand to include our entire portfolio of services as cell and gene therapy clinical trials advance and as commercial therapies ramp on a global basis.
Central Laboratories - With the increase and globalization of clinical studies and trials, supply chain support has become more complex and ensuring sample integrity has become more challenging. Reliable, specialty courier costs are now consuming an increasing portion of global protocol budgets. Thus, we believe laboratories performing the testing of samples collected during the conduct of these global multi-site studies are looking for cost effective, state-of-the-art temperature-controlled supply chain solutions. CRYOPDP’s services and its global network of logistic centers have successfully supported central laboratories throughout the world for many years. 
Fertility Clinics and IVF - Maintaining cryogenic temperatures during shipping and transfer of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) specimens like eggs, sperm, or embryos is critical for cell integrity to retain viability, stabilize the cells, and ensure reproducible results and successful IVF treatment. We believe that Cryoport Systems solutions for reproductive medicine are very compelling and well received. Additionally, MVE Biological Solutions supplies cryogenic systems to fertility clinics that wish to store and/or ship reproductive materials in their possession
Animal Health Companies - Our focus in Animal Health is supporting protein production. We provide cryogenic storage dewars to bovine breeders for the support of beef and milk production through artificial insemination, on a global basis. We also provide temperature-controlled supply chain services for advanced vaccines, primarily for aviary. MVE Biological Solutions and Cryoport Systems are our primary participants in this market. We also support therapies for companion and recreational animals which include canine and equine, in addition to veterinary laboratories and other animal related reproductive and health areas.
University and Health Center Research Facilities - Research is conducted globally at major universities and health centers and is often done in collaboration with others which requires using Cryoport Express® Shippers, CRYOPDP, and/or CRYOGENE services. Our broad line of products and services provide solutions tailored to these institutions and individual researchers.

Manufacturing and Raw Materials
Manufacturing - We source components for our products from multiple suppliers, including those that manufacture to our engineering specifications, using, in part, proprietary technology and know-how to mitigate supply chain risks. We also use “off-the-shelf” products, which we may modify to meet our requirements. For some components, there are relatively few alternate sources of supply and the establishment of additional or replacement suppliers may or may not be accomplished immediately. When this occurs, we endeavor to mitigate risk by locating an alternative qualified supplier and, as appropriate, increasing our inventory level. Additionally, there continues to be a worldwide shortage of semiconductor, memory and other electronic components affecting many industries. Certain of our MVE Biological Solutions products and our SmartPak system are dependent on some of these electronic components. A continued shortage of electronic components could impact us significantly and could cause us to experience extended lead times and increased prices from our suppliers. For additional information see “Part I, Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risk Related to Our Business—We depend on the availability of certain component products used in our solutions; delays or increased costs in the procurement of components manufactured by third parties could adversely affect our business operations, financial performance and results of operations, and we may experience customer dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation” in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Our vendor/partner relationships allow us to concentrate on further advancing and expanding our platform of systems, products, and solutions for the life sciences to meet the growing and varied demands for validated temperature-controlled solutions in the life sciences industry. We endeavor to keep our supply structure up to date and agile as it provides us the opportunity to rapidly scale to support our client’s commercialization, systems, products, and solutions requirements; however, we are ever mindful of the work we must do to improve our current sourcing and to continue to mitigate risks therein. 
Raw Materials - Various raw materials are used in the manufacture of our products and in the development of our technologies. Most raw materials are generally available from several alternate distributors and/or manufacturers. Where we have experienced significant difficulty in obtaining these raw materials, we have established alternative global sources or are working with the existing supplier to overcome its deficiency. 
Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks, and Proprietary Rights
To remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection on the proprietary aspects of our platform of technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. 
We file patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research, development and design. We currently own approximately 60 issued patents and have more than 100 pending patent applications throughout the world. Our patents generally protect certain aspects of our products and related technology. We also own common law and registered trademarks in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries to protect the names of our company, certain products, and key service brands. We own certain copyrights relating to certain aspects of our systems, products and services.
Our success is influenced, in part, by our ability to continue to develop proprietary products and technologies. It is desirable to obtain patent coverage for these products and technologies; however, some are protected as trade secrets. We intend to file trademark and patent applications covering any newly developed products, methods and technologies. However, there can be no guarantee that any of our pending or future filed applications will be issued as patents or registered as trademarks. There can be no guarantee that the various patent and trademark governmental agencies from around the world or some third party will not initiate an interference proceeding involving any of our pending applications or issued patents. Finally, there can be no guarantee that our issued patents or future issued patents, if any, will provide adequate protection from competition.

13



Patents provide some degree of protection for our proprietary technology. However, the pursuit and assertion of patent rights involve complex legal and factual determinations and, therefore, are characterized by significant uncertainty. In addition, the laws governing patent issuance and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve. Moreover, the patent rights we possess or are pursuing generally cover our technologies to varying degrees. As a result, we cannot ensure that patents will issue from any of our patent applications, or that any of the issued patents will offer meaningful protection. In addition, our issued patents may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or rendered unenforceable so that our patent rights may not create an effective barrier to competition. We must also pay maintenance fees at set intervals for our patents to not expire prematurely. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that any patents issued to us will provide a legal basis for establishing an exclusive market for our products or provide us with any competitive advantages, or that patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business or to continue to use our technologies freely. As with all patents, we may be subject to third parties filing claims that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert such claims against us or whether those claims will hurt our business. If we are forced to defend against such claims, regardless of their merit, we may face costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention and resources. As a result of any such disputes, we may have to develop, at a substantial cost, non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements may be unavailable on terms acceptable to such third parties, or at all, which could seriously harm our business or financial condition.
With respect to our trademarks, we file and pursue trademark registrations on words, symbols, logos, and other source identifiers that clients use to associate our products and services with us. Although our registered trademarks carry a presumption of validity, they can be challenged and possibly invalidated and as such, we cannot guarantee that any trademark registration is infallible.
We also rely on trade secret protection of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and third parties, although, in the past, we have not always obtained such agreements. It is possible that these agreements may be breached, invalidated, or rendered unenforceable, and if so, our trade secrets could be disclosed to our competitors. Despite the measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property, parties to such agreements may breach confidentiality provisions in our contracts or infringe or misappropriate our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. In addition, third parties may independently discover or invent competitive technologies, or reverse engineer our trade secrets or other technology. Therefore, the measures we are taking to protect our proprietary technology may not be adequate.
Cryoport’s Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs Programs
Cryoport is committed to quality, and this is reflected in all aspects of our global organization. From our innovative design of products and services to our continuous improvement initiatives, Cryoport has implemented comprehensive quality standards that match or exceed the stringent requirements within the markets we serve. Cryoport’s Quality Management Systems have been designed, implemented, and certified to meet ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 13485 standards in key global locations, demonstrating the discipline necessary to maintain a positive compliance profile. With our strong foundation in ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 13485, we leverage industry-specific experience with applicable regulatory requirements, and industry expectations, to create processes and procedures that incorporate strong operational practices of checks with verification. Our Quality Management Systems are designed to ensure proper controls in manufacturing, temperature-controlled supply chain services, logistics, bioprocessing, customer/client education, contracting, processing, shipping and biostorage, accumulation, and communication. 
Our Quality Management Systems incorporate notable good practice quality guidelines and regulations (GxP) elements, beyond those stipulated in ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 13485, to ensure our customers are supported in the manner necessary to maintain standards and to secure a positive compliance profile for Cryoport as a supplier and partner. Notable elements include, but are not limited to, Good Documentation Practices, Good Manufacturing Practices, Good Distribution Practices, archival processes and procedures, Supplier Controls, and Corrective Action and Preventive Action (CAPA) procedures, to highlight a few examples.

14



Through procedural requirements, Cryoport provides substantial risk-mitigation strategies throughout its full offering of products, systems, and services to support and maintain customer confidence. Metrics and key performance indicators are accumulated regularly, and are trended to predict, and mitigate, potential risks to operations. Operating and senior management utilized this information to enact decisions regarding procedures, processes, resource allocation, and corrective actions. Quality-driven initiatives are supported throughout our global organization. We are also subject to GMED, which is an international reference body in the certification of health care and medical devices quality management systems under ISO 9001, NF EN, and ISO 13485. As such, we are subject to audits by a Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) auditing organization. Cryoport’s cryogenic biostorage facilities are routinely inspected by the FDA and The Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT) to confirm regulatory compliance to industry requirements related to drug applications, filings, and maintenance of various cryogenically stored materials. 
Government Regulation
Globally, Cryoport is subject to regulations in numerous country jurisdictions and international regulations relating to manufacturing, shipments, customs, import, export, safe working conditions, environmental protection, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. In addition, we must ensure compliance with economic sanctions and/or restrictions on individuals, corporations, or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade that may apply to our international cross border business activities. 
The shipping of biologic products, biologic commodities, diagnostic specimens, infectious substances, and dangerous goods, whether via air or ground, falls under the jurisdictions of many country, state, federal, local and international agencies. The quality of the packaging that protects such commodities is critical in determining successful shipping conditions and to ensure a commodity will arrive at its destination in a satisfactory condition. Meeting stringent regulations such as Dangerous Goods Regulations, ISTA, and IATA, as applicable, Cryoport has demonstrated compliance and adhesion to these requirements. Many of the regulations for transporting dangerous goods in the United States are determined by international rules formulated under the auspices of the United Nations. Dangerous goods are typically one-time shipments and are not a part of our routine services. When called upon to ship dangerous goods, Cryoport follows strict and stringent guidelines. International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) is the United Nations organization that develops regulations (Technical Instructions) for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air. If shipment is by air, compliance with the rules established by the IATA is required. IATA is a trade association made up of airlines and air cargo couriers that publishes annual editions of the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations. These regulations interpret and add to the ICAO Technical Instructions to reflect industry practices. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) has regulations (published in the Code of Federal Regulations) for interstate shipping of specimens.
Our Cryoport Express® and ELITE™ Shippers meet Packing Instructions 602 and 650 and are certified for the shipment of Class 6.2 Dangerous Goods per the requirements of the ICAO Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air and IATA. Our present and planned future versions of the Cryoport SmartPak™ Condition Monitoring Systems will likely be subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), FDA, IATA and possibly other agencies which may be difficult to determine on a global basis. Additionally, our Chain of Compliance™ processes comply fully with ISO 21973 guidelines.
Storage of biological materials that are classified as drug products for human therapeutic use (either for investigational use or commercially approved) or materials used in the manufacture of drug products for human therapeutic use, is regulated by the FDA under Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (“CFR”) part 210 & 211. Facilities must be compliant with current GMP regulations which are enforced by the FDA through registration and audit. When drug products are exported to other countries, biostorage upon receipt must meet relevant local regulations.
Our MVE Biological Solutions cryogenic stainless-steel freezers and aluminum dewars are certified to the Medical Device Directive (MDD) in the EU. Additionally, registrations for import are in place for various countries with these requirements.
For additional information, see “Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters” in this Form 10-K.

Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Program
Beginning in 2020 we initiated a formal internal review of our ESG policies, procedures, and performance. Subsequently in February 2021, we publicly disclosed ESG information based on the framework and standards set by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Building upon our first report, we began with the goal of developing a formal, thoughtful, comprehensive, and right-sized sustainability program that would be used as a foundation for effectively organizing, reporting, and measuring our performance to set ESG goals in the future.
In June 2021, we began a materiality assessment to guide our overall sustainability strategy. The intent of the materiality assessment was to understand what ESG topics were important to our key stakeholders, to take into consideration Cryoport’s business strategy development, and to understand Cryoport’s global internal priorities. There were three key activities for this phase of the process: Benchmarking against peer companies, ratings received from ISS, MSCI, and Sustainalytics, and interviews with key stakeholders.
The information and feedback received from the materiality assessment was aggregated into a customized and weighted materiality matrix. The following Materiality Matrix follows GRI Standards recommendations and plots topics based on their relative priority resulting from the materiality assessment.
​
​
Once the Materiality Matrix was developed, several meetings were conducted internally with our ESG committee and our Board of Directors’ Nomination and Governance Committee to evaluate the findings.
As we proceeded on our ESG endeavor in 2022, our initial key focus was on Green House Gas (GHG) Emissions. GHG emissions were the foremost priority identified in our Materiality Matrix and represent a clear global significance for companies, consumers, and other stakeholders.
Cryoport engaged an ESG advisor upon completion of our Sustainability Strategy to assist in creating a report of our estimated global GHG emissions during 2021. The following summarizes that report.

16



Summary of our 2021 GHG Emissions Report
Methodology
We used the World Resource Institute’s Greenhouse Gas Protocol - Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) to calculate the company’s GHG emissions. The standard provides accounting tools to measure, manage, and report on GHG emissions. This protocol classifies emissions into three “scopes.” Scope 1 emissions includes direct GHG emissions, which occur from sources that are owned or controlled by a company. Scope 2 emissions include indirect GHG emission from purchased electricity. Scope 3 emissions include all other indirect GHG emissions. 
Organizational Boundary
The reporting boundary for the purposes of the report is Cryoport, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, which includes our four business units (MVE, Cryoport Systems, CRYOPDP and Cryogene) that was comprised of 41 facility locations across 13 countries (United States, China, Netherlands, Portugal, France, Belgium, United Kingdom, Poland, Germany, Singapore, India, South Korea, Australia) in 2021. 
Scope
The scope of the report includes our Scope 1 emissions (Direct) and Scope 2 emissions (Indirect emissions from purchased electricity), but generally excludes Scope 3 emissions (Other indirect emissions). However, we did quantify Scope 3 emissions from business travel for three business units and waste for two business units because the data was readily available to quantify such emissions. The following sources of emissions were included in the scope of the report for the identified business units:


 | Emission Type | Business Units | Source of Information 
--------+----------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scope 1 | Stationary Combustion | MVE, Cryoport Systems, Cryogene, CRYOPDP | Actual natural gas consumption or spend data at the majority of locations 
Scope 1 | Mobile Sources | MVE, Cryoport Systems, Cryogene, CRYOPDP | Vehicle fleet information (e.g., make model, year), as well as vehicle mileages or fuel usage data
Scope 1 | Refrigeration / AC Equipment Use | MVE, Cryoport Systems, Cryogene, CRYOPDP | Refrigerant types and recharge amounts 
Scope 2 | Purchased Electricity (Location-Based) | MVE, Cryoport Systems, Cryogene, CRYOPDP | Actual electricity consumption data at the majority of locations 
Scope 3 | Employee Business Travel | Cryoport Systems, CRYOPDP | Personal vehicle, airline, and rail mileages 
Scope 3 | Waste | MVE, CRYOPDP | Type and weight of waste streams 

​
Some of the Scope 3 emissions that contribute to our global carbon footprint, but for which we determined that data was not reasonably available for us to quantify in this report include, but are not limited to, transportation and distribution provided by third parties in the performance of our services; use and end-of-life treatment of sold products; and purchased goods and services.

17



Assumptions
We used various assumptions to quantify GHG emissions in the report. As with any projections or estimates, actual results or numbers may vary based upon factors such as variations in processes and operations, availability and quality of data, and methodologies used for measurement and estimation. Changes to emission estimates may occur if updated data or emission methodologies become available. The following are some primary assumptions or estimates that we made in the report:
Stationary Combustion – Natural Gas. Natural gas usage for heating was estimated for several company locations based on either (i) square footage using a. US average intensity for offices of 21.3 SCF/ft2, or (ii) spend data and regional utility rates, depending on what information was available.
Purchased Electricity (Location-Based). Electricity usage was estimated for several company locations based on either (i) square footage using a US average intensity for offices of 13.6 kWh/ft2, or (ii) spend data and regional utility rates, depending on what information was available. 
Utility Estimations. When there were gaps in electricity or natural gas data, the average of the prior and following months data was used to estimate the missing information.
Results
Our 2021 Total Emissions, as calculated in the report are as follows:

​ | ​ | ​ 
------------------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------
​ | ​ | 2021 Total Emissions
​ | Emission Type | (MT CO2-e) 
Scope 1 | Stationary Combustion | 447 
Scope 1 | Mobile Sources | 2,016 
Scope 1 | Refrigeration / AC Equipment | 150 
Scope 2 | Purchased Electricity (Location-Based) | 6,988 
Total Scope 1 + 2 | 9,602 MT CO2-e 
Scope 3 | Employee Business Travel | 32 
Scope 3 | Waste | 110 
Total Scope 1, 2, and 3 | 9,744 MT CO2-e 

​

18



The following chart shows the percent of total emissions in 2021 that was contributed by each type of emission quantified in the report:

2021 Carbon Footprint Intensities
The following table shows our 2021 carbon footprint intensity in relation to square feet of our facilities, revenue, and employees.

​​​ | ​ 
--------------------------------+---------------------------
Total Scope 1 + 2 Emissions | 9,602 MT CO2-e 
Intensity by Square Footage | 
Total Facility Square Footage | 555,732 ft2 
Emissions per Square Foot | 0.01728 MT CO2-e / ft2 
Intensity by Employee | 
Number of Employees | 795 
Emissions per Employee | 12.08 MT CO2-e / employee 
Intensity by Revenue | 
Total Revenue | $223 million 
Emissions per $ million Revenue | 43.13 MT CO2-e / $ million

​
The following chart shows the intensity of 2021 emissions from stationary combustion and purchased electricity by square foot on for each facility. The average facility intensity was 0.0115 MT CO2–e per square foot, as indicated by the dashed horizontal line within the following chart.

19



Intensity of GHG From Statutory Combustion and Purchased Electricity by Facility Square Footage
Next Steps
Using the 2021 carbon footprint as a baseline, Cryoport plans to calculate an annual carbon footprint. Conducting an annual carbon footprint not only allows Cryoport to track changes (i.e., increases or reductions in emissions, fuel usage, or energy usage by facility), but will also be helpful in ultimately setting emission reduction targets.
We are also considering focusing on another topic within our materiality matrix (e.g., resource efficiency) to further the company’s ESG journey.

Employee Health & Safety
Safety is a priority in every aspect of our business. Across our companies, we are committed to making our workplaces and communities safer for our employees, customers, and the public. Our corporate philosophy is embedded in our day-to-day work through rigorous policies and continual education. 
Cryoport’s Employee Health & Safety (EHS) programs have resulted in strong safety performance, as demonstrated by our total injury rate (TIR) and lost time injury rate (LTIR) being significantly lower than the global industry averages. Facilitated by our culture of continuous improvement, we are committed to continue to work toward reducing our TIR and LTIR numbers even further.
To understand and improve our safety performance, we evaluate our operational performance across a variety of indicators—including lost-time-injury rate (LTIR)—on a daily basis. In FY22, our LTIR was 1.23, a decrease of 47.7% compared to FY21. In addition to looking at lagging indicators of safety performance, we frequently evaluate the effectiveness of new metrics, including leading indicators, as we strive to improve our safety performance. Cryoport’s operating companies are responsible for implementing policies and procedures aligned with international standards that account for their business and the associated health and safety risks. 
We continue to have flexible working arrangements, including telecommuting and part time arrangements, to maintain a safe working environment for our employees throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
Innovating Responsibility
Cryoport recognizes the role we play in protecting the health and safety of current and future generations through services and solutions that promote sustainability, resilience, and respect for the environment. We strive for a product base that is of the highest quality and with long use phases to minimize impact associated with production of new product, and Cryoport reviews opportunities to eliminate materials of concern and related managed waste streams on a regular cadence.

21



Product & Service Quality
As a temperature-controlled supply chain provider to the life sciences industry, Cryoport must comply with the safe transportation of regulated hazardous materials. As a result, we have designed and developed several features in its various products to comply with US DOT, IATA, ICAO, and other regulatory and guidance bodies. Additionally, safety warnings are included in our product labeling as well as our manuals. Our products are designed to conform to the following standards (where applicable):

These standards are woven into our development methodology used to design all new products within the organization. This development process includes a risk management assessment done in accordance with ISO 14971 that identifies hazards and mitigates risks via design improvements, process improvement, and warnings (including labels and safety information shipped with the product).
We pride ourselves on our exceptional operational quality. Our temperature-controlled supply chain solutions focused on cell and gene therapies boast a 95.20% delivery success rate and due to this performance 12,572 additional patients were able to receive therapies over the past 24 months and 1,641 intended parents are potentially able to have successful cycles resulting in the birth of a child on an annual basis because of our CryoStork® solution.
While rare, recalls of product may become necessary. The primary responsibility for recall management lies with our Vice President of Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs for manufacturing. The executive staff is involved in decision and implementation processes depending upon the specifics of any recall required. Customer service personnel, sales staff and other resources would then be utilized in reaching all distributors and direct end users. Results of recalls are evaluated daily until the recall is closed. There were no product recalls during 2022.
Product Lifecycle Management
Cryoport creates unique products with long-term use in mind. Cryoport products are primarily constructed of recyclable aluminum or stainless steel, and we approach the extension of product lifecycles through the following four areas:

● | Longevity
--+----------


● | Reparability
--+-------------


● | Reusability
--+------------


● | Recyclability
--+--------------

22



We strive for a product base with long use phases to minimize impact associated with production of new product. At our MVE Biological Solutions production facility, we manufacture cryogenic freezer units that utilize 1/587 of the energy used by conventional mechanical freezers used for similar applications. For example, our freezer production displaced annual electricity consumption by 166,255,209 kWh from what would otherwise be consumed from alternative products. This amount of electricity could power 15,513 homes (sized at 2,500 square feet) annually. This reduction in energy consumption from our freezer lines alone equates to 136,733,034 pounds of GHG emissions avoided or the emissions equivalent to 13,364 passenger vehicles driven for one year.
Cryoport regularly reviews opportunities to eliminate the use of materials considered hazardous and related managed waste streams on a regular cadence. Cryoport does not utilize any substances of concern in our products; We do currently utilize minimal quantities of hazardous materials that are not listed substances of concern in our operations, primarily in the form of isopropanol, epoxies, butyl cellosolve, lacquer thinner, paint, hyamine and isopropyl alcohol. These materials and the insignificant quantities of hazardous wastes generated in our production facilities are managed in compliance with all state and federal regulations. Any hazardous waste that is generated is tracked and managed with an overall goal of eliminating hazardous materials where possible. Cryoport strives to have a conflict-free supply chain and is committed to working with its suppliers to increase transparency regarding the origin of minerals contained in its products, including minerals identified as conflict minerals (tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold), and has adopted a Conflict Minerals Policy, which is available on our website at www.cryoport.com on the “Investor Relations: Corporate Governance” page under the heading “Governance Documents.”
Governing Ethically 
Cryoport recognizes constructive supplier relationships as essential to our ability to meet customer requirements for quality solutions. We expect our business partners to share our commitment to ethics, integrity, compliance, safety, human rights, data security, and environmental protection. By the same token, as a provider accountable to thousands of companies worldwide, we pledge, through our ESG performance, to meet or exceed our clients’ requirements for the same.
Business Ethics
We are committed to operating with honesty, truthfulness and transparency in accordance with the highest ethical and corporate governance standards – mutual respect, integrity and trust are our foundation. As an ethical operator, we have developed a robust Code of Conduct and hold ourselves accountable to it in all we do. All employees across our operations are provided with training and reference materials to reinforce this commitment to integrity and ethics in our business. Our policies are clearly defined, published in local languages where applicable, and include guidance on topics including, but not limited to:

● | Corruption
--+-----------


● | Anti-Trust and Anti-Competitive Behavior
--+-----------------------------------------


● | Insider Dealings
--+-----------------


● | Gifts
--+------


● | Bribes (e.g., explicit prohibition of facilitation payments)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | Conflicts of Interest
--+----------------------


● | Intellectual Property
--+----------------------


● | Compliance
--+-----------


● | Truthful and accurate reporting
--+--------------------------------


● | Interactions with Healthcare professionals
--+-------------------------------------------


● | Whistleblower protections (including non-retaliation)
--+------------------------------------------------------

Political Activity and Contributions (e.g., explicit prohibition of contribution of any kind to any candidate or political party without express prior approval of the Board of Directors – this covers both direct contributions and indirection support; no political contributions have been made in recent years).
In addition to our Code of Conduct, our senior leadership team actively oversees the governance of our ethics programs to help ensure that commitment is driven from the top down, and that program owners are accountable for successful program compliance.

23



Cryoport does not conduct clinical trials, animal testing or use human tissue of any kind in the manufacture or design of our products, and our Code of Conduct governs the ethical behavior of our employees across Cryoport operations. Further, the Company does not conduct lobbying activities.
Supplier Management
Temperature-controlled supply chain support to the life sciences industry is critical to all that Cryoport does; therefore, we take an active approach to managing suppliers and partners to ensure that appropriate compliance, health, safety, labor practices, and ethical standards are employed. Our internal diligence process for third-party vendors including a supplier questionnaire that is required for vendor approval and a regular auditing scheme thereafter for existing suppliers. The questionnaire is intended to verify that programs exist to manage material risk areas associated with the given supplier’s operations and particular consideration is paid to bribery or other forms of corrupt activity. No suppliers are approved until this mandatory due diligence is complete and a completed assessment form is on file.
As an example of verification that programs exist to manage material risks for any given supplier, if our transportation suppliers employ or work with a Dangerous Goods Safety Advisor, we confirm the presence of a credentialed role responsible for overseeing activities associated with dangerous goods, including but not limited to, employee training and coaching, reporting, and monitoring of activities associated with the transportation of dangerous goods. The purpose of this inquiry is to gauge the degree of oversight over dangerous goods management by our suppliers to help ensure product and employee welfare.
Our Code of Conduct extends through our suppliers and thus sets an expectation for our suppliers to commit to operating with honesty, truthfulness and transparency in accordance to the highest ethical and corporate governance standards, as Cryoport personifies through our operations. Per our Code of Conduct, Cryoport will not tolerate the use by suppliers of forced labor in any form.
Data Privacy & Security
Cryoport uses an outside Center for Internet Security (CIS) assessment firm to evaluate its data security controls in an effort protect our businesses and secure the information of our employees and customers. The evaluation process utilizes the CIS Critical Security Controls Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) methodology, and is an ongoing initiative used to continuously improve the CMMI rating for the Company.
Our customers rely on Cryoport to securely and reliably deliver temperature-controlled supply chain solutions globally, including providing a secure online portal for order entry, tracking, condition monitoring, and for the retrieval of historic information. Protecting the privacy of our customers and vendors is essential to maintaining their trust, and we take a proactive approach to safeguard all data and ensure a secure environment. With the increasing presence and sophistication of online threats, we must ensure continuous improvement to protect our business and our customers. We regularly review our technology, policies, and practices to maintain compliance with all relevant regulations. We do not sell customers’ data to third parties. Additionally, Cryoport employees with a computer are required to complete an annual online training course on information security and data privacy. The course addresses a range of topics related to information security and data privacy, including awareness regarding social engineering and cybercrimes, protecting the workplace, and protecting data.
Code of Ethics
Our Code of Ethical Business Conduct applies to our directors and all employees, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and is available on our website at www.cryoport.com on the “Investor Relations: Corporate Governance” page under the heading “Governance Documents.”
The Cryoport Code of Ethical Business Conduct serves as the foundation of our corporate integrity and compliance program. Our officers, directors, and managers are responsible for promoting the principles within the Code and fostering a culture of ethical conduct. We regularly review and update the Code to ensure it remains relevant and available to our global employees. The Code covers a breadth of topics, including conflicts of interest, equal employment opportunity and anti-harassment, environmental compliance and sustainability, insider trading rules, and how to report violations of Company policies. Our commitment to doing the right thing depends on our employees’ being comfortable in reporting any suspected violations of law or unethical conduct, and our leaders’ abilities to address suspected violations promptly, with respect. Our global policy against retaliation encourages employees to come forward to report concerns in good faith. When a matter is reported to a manager or Human Resources, the concern is reviewed to determine whether it should be escalated to the Legal department. The legal department also has criteria for further escalation, if necessary, to legal department management. Every new hire is introduced to the Code through training and orientation.

We develop and update these policies when we identify a need for employee clarification, the emergence of new laws or regulations, or other external factors. We routinely update the language in our policies, and how we present information, to ensure our employees understand the risks they face in their jobs, and steps they can take to mitigate those risks and report potential problems.
Our commitment to human rights is an important part of our Code of Ethical Business Conduct. We are committed to protecting and advancing human rights in our operations around the world. We pay fair wages and comply with wage laws in all the countries where we operate. We prohibit the use of child, compulsory, or forced labor, and we share the zero-tolerance policies adopted by the United States and other governments against slavery and human trafficking. We prohibit the trafficking of persons for any purpose and trafficking-related activities, and we expect the same from our suppliers and vendors.
Cryoport Societal and Environmental Impact Statements
Examples of some of our positive societal and environmental impacts for 2022 include the following:


Pathways | Impacts | 2022 Outcomes 
---------------------------+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cryoport Systems / CRYOPDP | Access for Patients | 13,718additional patients were able to receive therapies over past 24 months 
CryoStork® | Patient Success & Satisfaction | 1,641Intended Parents able to have successful cycles resulting in the birth of a child
MVE Biological Solutions | Energy Saved | 166,225,209kWh annual energy reduction, or 136,733,034 pounds of GHG emissions avoided
CRYOGENE | Energy Saved | 1,398,686pounds of GHG emissions avoided due to renewable energy generation 

​
Our positive impacts for 2022 were based on the following:
Access to Patients. Our calculation of the number of additional patients that were able to receive therapies was based our success rate for shipments, which is higher than the average success rate in the cold chain markets of 80%, pursuant to Rodrigue, J-P (2020), The Geography of Transport Systems, Fifth Edition, New York: Routledge.
Patient Success & Satisfaction. Our calculation of the number of intended parents able to have successful cycles resulting the birth of a child is based on the weighted average chance of a live singleton birth per intended egg retrieval across women of all ages of 27.09% as reported in the 2020 Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) Clinic Summary Report (CSR).
Energy Saved – MVE Biological Solutions. Our calculation of energy reduction is based on the reduced energy consumption from MVE freezer use compared to the average energy consumed by operation of mechanical freezers, which we assumed to be 31.7 kWh/day based on product specifications from a mechanical freezer manufacturer. 
Energy Saved – CRYOGENE. CRYOGENE contracted with an energy provider with carbon-free energy credits (EFEC). At least 35% of the power consumed for CRYOGENE is from emission-free resources. Our calculation of GHG emissions avoided is based on the output mission rates for GHG emissions from the EPA eGRID data (2021) for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).

Employees
We refer to our employees as our “team.” They are critical to our success, and we are in constant communication and training. We believe that we have assembled a strong management and leadership team with the experience and expertise needed to execute our business strategy.

This increase of over 177 employees compared to December 31, 2021 is, primarily as a result of the further build out of our global organization, both organically and through acquisitions, to support our expanded solutions offering and the expected growth in the markets we serve. We anticipate hiring additional personnel as required to support our global growth strategy.
