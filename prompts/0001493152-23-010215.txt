ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an ophthalmic research and development company focused on developing technologies to screen, monitor, diagnose and treat ocular, optical, and sight-threatening disorders. Our mission is to prevent vision loss and blindness due to diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy through early detection from use of two devices: (1) Retinal Imaging Screening Device (RetinalGenixTM), being designed as a portable, high resolution retinal imaging Diabetic screening system providing a 200-degree field of view without requiring pupil dilation; and (2) RetinalCamTM, being designed as a high resolution home monitoring retinal imaging device and physician alert system offering real-time communication with physicians available 24/7. RetinalCamTM, is anticipated to have the capability to be used by patients in a variety of locations including at home, primary care centers, emergency rooms and telehealth centers and nursing homes, at a more efficient cost that is expected to be lower than that of a CT scan and an MRI. Initially, our primary focus was on designing the RetinalGenixTM) high resolution retinal imaging system for Diabetic screening, however, due to the cost for such development, including the additional resources, personnel and equipment that will be required in order to obtain Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulatory approval for commercialization of RetinalGenixTM,) we have shifted our focus to development of the RetinalcamTM high resolution retinal imaging, home monitoring device and alert system. Currently, the majority of our design development team is focused on the development of the RetinalcamTM which does not require FDA approval for its commercialization. We have also recently acquired a pharmacogenetic mapping technology that is expected to have the ability to screen, monitor, and provide data to profile, trend and create diagnostic markers for systemic and retinal disorders i.e., cardiovascular, Alzheimers, Parkinsonism and other diseases. The markers and data analysis are expected to be rapid and cost effective and should eliminate expensive diagnostic equipment such as MRIs and CT scanning in many cases. The results are confidential to the patient and anonymous for any third party without permission of the patient.
 
To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing, business planning, raising capital, designing and developing product candidates, and securing manufacturing partners. We do not have any products developed on a commercial scale or approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the private placement of common stock.
 
We anticipate that we will need an additional $12,000,000 to (i) complete product design and testing for the RetinalGenixTM and RetinalCamTM and submit RetinalGenixTM for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) clearance (we anticipate that the RetinalCamTM will not require FDA clearance); (ii) complete the development and expansion of the software tools around the recently acquired DNA/GPS’ genetic mapping technology (which we anticipate will require approximately $2,000,000); and (iii) build the infrastructure for our sustained growth. We intend to obtain such funds through the sales of our equity and debt securities and/or through potential strategic partnerships; however, no assurance can be provided that funds will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.
 
We do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales unless and until we either successfully complete development of RetinalCamTM, or we successfully obtain regulatory clearance for RetinalGenixTM. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations, compliance and other expenses. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other capital sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed, on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates.
 
We have been issuing shares of our common stock pursuant to a private placement raising approximately $3.0 million from the sale of 3,010,000 shares of common stock from 2019 through December 31, 2021. An additional 60,500 shares were sold in January 2022 pursuant to this private placement. In October 2021, the registration statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration Statement”) that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) pursuant to which we registered for resale shares of common stock, including shares of common stock sold in the offering and shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants was declared effective. No funds were raised by the Company pursuant to the Registration Statement.
 
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
 
Our acquisition of DNA/GPS Inc.
 
On July 5, 2022, we entered into an exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Dr. Lawrence Perich pursuant to which we acquired all the outstanding shares of DNA/GPS Inc., a pharmacogenetics company based in Tampa, Florida (“DNA/GPS”), in exchange for the issuance of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock (the “Shares”). The acquisition of DNA/GPS allows us to combine DNA/GPS’ genetic mapping capabilities with our high resolution retinal imaging. The combined technology should have the ability to screen, monitor, and provide data to profile, trend and create diagnostic markers for systemic and retinal disorders i.e., cardiovascular, Alzheimer’s, Parkinsonism etc. The markers and data analysis are expected to be rapid and cost effective and should eliminate expensive diagnostic equipment such as MRI, CT scanning etc. in many cases. Dr. Perich joined our advisory board upon consummation of the acquisition. Upon acquiring DNA/GPS, we acquired the right to their platform technology that has the ability to screen, monitor, and provide data to profile, trend and create diagnostic markers for systemic and retinal disorders i.e., cardiovascular, Alzheimer’s, Parkinsonism and other diseases. This platform, if it received regulatory approval may offer an opportunity to bring testing away from laboratories and hospitals into primary care centers where it could be handled at reasonable prices. Since many manifestations of diseases are often seen in the eye, we believe it is possible to observe correlations between damage in the eye and kidney disease, high blood pressure and heart problems.

Market Opportunity
 
Our devices are being designed initially to detect the earliest stages of diabetic retinopathy to prevent blindness. Diabetic Retinopathy (“DR”) happens when too much blood sugar (glucose) associated with diabetes damages the blood vessels in the retina. As a result, the retina does not get enough oxygen and nutrients, and blood vessels can leak blood into the retina. According to the Mayo Clinic, DR is the leading cause of new cases of blindness in people 20 to 74 years of age in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) 2022 National Diabetes Statistics Report, more than 130 million adults are living with diabetes or prediabetes in the United States. The American Diabetes Association reports that diabetic retinopathy is the most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of blindness in American adults. The number of individuals with diabetic retinopathy is predicted to increase by nearly 50% (it’s actually 47.7%) to over 11 million people by 2030. According to the CDC, 34.2 million patients in the U.S. have diabetic maculopathy with 26.9 million diagnosed and 7.3 million undiagnosed. In addition, 88 million adult Americans are pre-diabetics of which 84%, or 74 million, are undiagnosed. Diabetic maculopathy effects 500 million patients globally.
Competition
 
The ophthalmic medical technology industries utilize rapidly advancing technologies and are characterized by intense competition. There is a strong emphasis on intellectual property and proprietary products. We face competition from different sources including ophthalmic medical technology companies, academic institutions, government agencies, and public and private research institutions. For example, we face competition from Optomed plc. (“Optomed”), Optos plc (“Optos”) and Zeiss with respect to our RetinalGeniXTM Imaging System. Optos has developed and is currently globally marketing a wide screen imaging system that has a 200-degree field of view that screens for diabetic retinopathy, and Optomed has developed and is currently globally marketing a wide screen imaging system that has a 150 degree field of view that screens for diabetic retinopathy. Zeiss has developed and is currently globally marketing a wide screen imaging system that has a 200-degree field of view that screens for diabetic retinopathy. Although we face competition with respect to our RetinalGeniXTM Imaging System, we do not believe we face competition with respect to our RetinalCamTM.
 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, medical device development and obtaining regulatory approvals than us as well as more established distribution networks and relationships with healthcare providers. Mergers and acquisitions in the ophthalmic medical technology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our products.
 
Manufacturing and Supply
 
On June 24, 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (“Master Services Agreement”) with ADM Tronics Unlimited, Inc. (“ADM Tronics”), pursuant to which ADM Tronics will provide us with design, engineer and provide regulatory services related to RetinalGenixTM and RetinalCamTM.
 
On October 8, 2019, we entered into an option exchange agreement (the “Option Exchange Agreement”) with Diopsys, Inc. (“Diopsys”) pursuant to which we shall issue Diopsys an option to purchase up to 10% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and Diopsys shall issue us an option to purchase up to 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Diopsys on the Closing Date (the “Option Exchange”). “Closing Date” means a date that is within 30 days of the date that all of the contingencies set forth in the Option Exchange Agreement are satisfied including, but not limited to, approval of a product by the FDA. In addition, pursuant to the Option Exchange Agreement, upon the closing of the Option Exchange, we shall enter into an exclusive distribution agreement with Diopsys pursuant to which Diopsys shall act as our exclusive distributor of such product. The agreement was terminated on February 14, 2022.
 
Intellectual Property Portfolio
 
Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies and information, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark, and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties.

Sublicense Agreement with Sanovas Ophthalmology LLC
 
On June 24, 2021, we entered into a sublicense agreement (“Sublicense Agreement”) with Sanovas Ophthalmology LLC (“Sanovas Ophthalmology”), a company for which our Chief Executive Officer is also the managing member, pursuant to which Sanovas Ophthalmology granted us an exclusive worldwide (“Territory”) license to certain intellectual property, including six patents, two patent applications, and two trademark applications, licensed to Sanovas Ophthalmology by Sanovas Intellectual Property LLC relating to certain technologies for eye and ocular visualization and monitoring (“Licensed IP”) for uses related to the screening, examination, diagnosis, prevention and/or treatment of any eye disease, medical condition or disorder, or any disease, medical condition or disorder affecting the eye. The Licensed IP which has been issued by the USPTO and relates to methods of use and systems expires on dates ranging from September 2034 to December 2034, and the Licensed IP which is still pending before the USPTO also relates to methods of use and systems. Pursuant to the Sublicense Agreement, commencing on the date of the first commercial sale of a Licensed Product (as defined in the Sublicense Agreement), in each country in the Territory and continuing on a country by country basis until the expiration or termination of the last Valid Claim (as defined herein) of a licensed patent in such country (the “Royalty End Date”), we shall pay Sanovas Ophthalmology a royalty equal to a mid-single digit percentage of any Net Sales (as defined in the Sublicense Agreement) of any Licensed Product. “Valid Claim” means an issued, unexpired patent claim contained in a licensed patent as long as the claim has not been admitted by Sanovas Intellectual Property, LLC, the owner of the Licensed IP, or otherwise caused to be invalid or unenforceable through reissue, disclaimer or otherwise, or held invalid or unenforceable by a tribunal or governmental agency of competent jurisdiction from whose judgment no appeal is allowed or timely taken. The Sublicense Agreement shall continue until the Royalty End Date, unless earlier terminated pursuant to its terms. The Sublicense Agreement may be terminated by either party if the other party materially breaches the Sublicense Agreement in a manner that cannot be cured, or materially breaches the Sublicense Agreement in a manner that can be cured, and such breach remains uncured for more than 30 days after the receipt by the breaching party of notice specifying the breach. Furthermore, we may terminate the Sublicense Agreement at any time upon 90 days written notice to Sanovas Ophthalmology.
Government Regulation
 
Our business is subject to extensive, complex, and rapidly changing federal and state laws and regulations. Various federal and state agencies have discretion to issue regulations any interpret and enforce healthcare laws. While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction, and interpretation of existing laws and regulations may change periodically. Federal and state legislatures also may enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business.
United States Regulations
 
In the U.S., medical devices are subject to regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. The FDCA and regulations govern, among other things, the design, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion, post-approval monitoring and reporting, distribution and import and export of medical devices. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative and judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to grant requests for 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or premarket approval of new products or modified products, issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, mandatory product recalls, import detentions, civil monetary penalties, and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
 
The FDCA classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject only to the general regulatory controls. Class II devices are moderate risk. They are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices. They are required to obtain premarket approval and comply with post-market conditions of approval in addition to general regulatory controls.
 
We believe RetinalGenixTM is a Class II medical device that will require 510(k) clearance from the FDA. In addition, we believe RetinalCamTM will be considered a Class II exempt medical device because it is non-diagnostic in nature, and therefore, we do not anticipate needing 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market such product. Pursuant to FDA product classification codes for ophthalmic cameras under 21 C.F.R. § 886.1120, “PJZ” cameras are prescription devices indicated only for the capture and storage of images of the eye and surrounding area in the general population. PJZ cameras cannot be indicated for any specific population (e.g., pediatrics, AMD patients, etc.), cannot contain any type of “diagnostic” or “aid in diagnosis” claims in the indication for use, and cannot reference any specific disease. PJZ cameras do not exceed group 1 radiant exposure limits for ultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiation under all light energy conditions, as defined in the ANSI Z80.36-2016 standard Light Hazard Protection for Ophthalmic Instruments. PJZ cameras also have other design and performance characteristics that are described by FDA in the product code description.
 
If the RetinalGeniXTM were to be classified as a Class II medical device, such classification would require us to submit a premarket notification submission to FDA prior to marketing. We anticipate the submission will require clinical evidence of safety and efficacy, generated through a regulated, randomized clinical trial or field evaluation. FDA clearance for ophthalmological devices usually require about 170 days.
 
We intend to launch RetinalCamTM in the fall of 2023 and we intend to apply for 510(k) clearance for RetinalGenixTM in 2024.
 FDA Pre-Market Authorization and Notification
 
Under FDA regulations, all devices, including Class I devices, are subject to general controls, which are the basic authorities of the Medical Device Amendments that provide the FDA with the means of regulating devices to ensure their safety and effectiveness (e.g., labeling, facility registration and device listing and adherence to Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) requirements). For Class III devices, a pre-market approval (“PMA”) application will be required unless the device is a pre-amendment device (on the market prior to the passage of the medical device amendments in 1976, or substantially equivalent to such a device) or is exempted from submission of a PMA. In that case, a 510(k) will be the route to market. A 510(k) clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class I or II medical device, or to a Class III medical device for which the FDA has not required a PMA. The FDA may determine that a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device or that additional information or data are needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made. A request for additional data may require that clinical studies of the device’s safety and efficacy be performed.
 
While most Class I and some Class II devices may be marketed without prior FDA authorization, most other medical devices can be legally sold within the U.S. only if the FDA has: (i) approved a PMA prior to marketing, generally applicable to most Class III devices; (ii) cleared the device in response to a premarket notification, or 510(k) submission, generally applicable to Class I and II devices; or (iii) authorized the device to be marketed through the de novo classification process, generally applicable for novel Class I or II devices. PMA applications, 510(k) premarket notifications, and de novo requests require payment of substantial user fees that are modified each fiscal year.

Commercial distribution of a device for which a 510(k) notification is required may begin only after the FDA issues an order finding the device to be substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device. Even in cases where the FDA grants a 510(k) clearance, it may take the FDA between four and nine months from the date of submission to grant a 510(k) clearance, but may take longer.
 
A “not substantially equivalent” determination, or a request for additional information, could delay the market introduction of new products that fall into this category and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For any of our products that are cleared through the 510(k) process, modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or efficacy of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require new 510(k) submissions.
 
Any products manufactured or distributed by us are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the use of the device. Device manufacturers are required to register their establishments and list their devices with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies. The FDCA requires devices to be manufactured to comply with applicable QSR regulations which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us with respect to design, development, manufacturing and quality assurance activities. The FDA enforces its requirements by market surveillance and periodic visits, both announced and unannounced, to inspect or re-inspect equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes to confirm regulatory compliance. These inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. Following an inspection, the FDA may issue a report, known as a Form 483, listing instances where the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures or, if observed violations are sufficiently severe and urgent, a warning letter. If the manufacturer does not adequately respond to a Form 483 or warning letter, the FDA make take enforcement action against the manufacturer or impose other sanctions or consequences.
 
We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Public Health to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors.
 
510(k) Premarket Notification Pathway
 
Product marketing in the U.S. for most Class II and a limited number of Class I devices typically follows the 510(k) premarket notification pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, referred to as the “predicate device.” A predicate device may be a previously 510(k)-cleared device placed in Class I or Class II via a finding of substantial equivalence to a lawfully marketed Class I or Class II device, or a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 and for which the FDA has not yet called for PMA applications, or a product previously placed in Class I or Class II through the de novo classification process. A finding of “substantial equivalence” means the FDA must conclude that the proposed device has the same intended use as a predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or it has different technological characteristics but submitted information (potentially including clinical data) shows it is as safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device.
 
The FDA has a user fee goal to apply no more than 90 calendar review days to 510(k) submissions. During the process, the FDA may issue an Additional Information request, which stops the clock. The applicant has no more than 180 days to respond (after which the submission is automatically terminated). Therefore, the total review time could be up to a maximum of 270 days.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance for the modified device, the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA approval. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
 
Post-market Requirements
 
After a device is placed on the market, numerous general regulatory controls apply. These include: the QSR, labeling regulations, the medical device reporting regulations (which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), and reports of corrections and removals regulations (which require manufacturers to report recalls or removals and field corrections to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA). Failure to properly identify reportable events or to file timely reports, as well as failure to address each of the observations to FDA’s satisfaction, can subject a manufacturer to warning letters, recalls, or other sanctions and penalties.
 
Labeling and promotion activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and by the Federal Trade Commission. The FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved uses. We and our products are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where our products will be marketed. Any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market our products in those states or localities. Manufacturers are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. Such laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business.
 
Advertising, marketing and promotional activities for devices are also subject to FDA oversight and must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. The FDA’s oversight authority review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media. The FDA also regulates industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context.

Manufacturers of medical devices are permitted to promote products solely for the uses and indications set forth in the approved or cleared product labeling. A number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for “off-label” uses (i.e., uses that are not described in the approved or cleared labeling), including actions alleging that claims submitted to government healthcare programs for reimbursement of products that were promoted for “off-label” uses are fraudulent in violation of the Federal False Claims Act or other federal and state statutes and that the submission of those claims was caused by off-label promotion. The failure to comply with prohibitions on “off-label” promotion can result in significant monetary penalties, revocation or suspension of a company’s business license, suspension of sales of certain products, product recalls, civil or criminal sanctions, exclusion from participating in federal healthcare programs, or other enforcement actions. In the United States, allegations of such wrongful conduct could also result in a corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. government that imposes significant administrative obligations and costs.
 
Violations of the FDCA relating to the inappropriate promotion of approved products may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.
 
For a Class II or Class III device meeting certain requirements, the FDA also may require post-market surveillance requirements. Additionally, the FDA may place conditions on a PMA-approved device that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, all classes of devices must comply with quality-control, manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures under the QSR, and manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA for compliance. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with the QSR. The FDA may withdraw product approvals or recommend or require product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory requirements.
 
Export of our products is regulated by the FDA and subject to the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. §§381-384f, and other statutes FDA administers, which greatly expanded the export of approved and unapproved United States medical devices. Some foreign countries require manufacturers to provide a specific type of FDA export certificate (such as a Certificate to Foreign Government or Certificate of Exportability), which may require the device manufacturer to certify the device is lawfully marketed in the United States, including in conformance with QSR requirements, labeling regulations, premarket notification, and other requirements. The FDA will refuse to issue any export certificate if significant outstanding QSR violations exist.
 
European Union Regulations
 
In the European Union (“EU”), there are four main medical device classes: I, IIa, IIb and III. Similar to the US classification system, the EU classification system is a risk-based system, depending on the potential risk associated with the device. In the EU, we believe the RetinalCamTM would be considered a Class IIa medical device, which would require the grant of a CE marking prior to launching in the EU. To obtain a CE marking, the device manufacturer must be certified to ISO 13485, and the product must meet certain harmonized standards for its design, development and testing. If the manufacturer is not self-certifying, outside agencies (known as Notified Bodies) will be required to test and certify that the device meets the applicable requirements, including clinical evidence of safe and effective use prior to the product being released for general market introduction.
Other Healthcare Laws
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback, false claims, transparency and health information privacy laws and other healthcare laws and regulations.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”) amended the intent element of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Additionally, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal civil False Claims Act. Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Pharmaceutical and medical device companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the Civil Monetary Penalties Law statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by HIPAA, which prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

Further, pursuant to the ACA, CMS issued a final rule that requires certain manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and annually report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other health care professionals (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data are made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.
 
Analogous state and foreign anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non- governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor. In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Further, certain states require the posting of information relating to clinical trials and their outcomes. In addition, certain states require medical device companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes.
 
Privacy and Data Protection Laws
 
Data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which business is conducted may also be applicable. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA requires covered entities to limit the use and disclosure of protected health information to specifically authorized situations and requires covered entities to implement security measures to protect health information that they maintain in electronic form. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 
In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information, and such laws may differ from each other, all of which may complicate compliance efforts. For example, the CCPA, which increases privacy rights for California residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information, came into effect on January 1, 2020. Among other things, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and provide such consumers new data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. On November 3, 2020, California voters approved a new privacy law, the CPRA, which significantly modifies the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain personal information and creating a new state agency to oversee implementation and enforcement efforts. Many of the CPRA’s provisions will become effective on January 1, 2023. State laws are changing rapidly and there is discussion in the U.S. of a new comprehensive federal data privacy law.
 
Healthcare Reform


Healthcare reforms that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, have been focused on cost containment in the healthcare system and could result in reductions in coverage and levels of reimbursement for healthcare products, increases in rebates payable under U.S. government rebate programs and additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical product prices. On September 9, 2021, the Biden administration published a wide-ranging list of policy proposals, most of which would need to be carried out by Congress, to reduce drug prices and drug payment. The Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) plan includes, among other reform measures, proposals to lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and disincentivizing price increases, and to support market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase price transparency. These initiatives recently culminated in the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) in August 2022, which will, among other things, allow HHS to negotiate the selling price of certain drugs and biologics that CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D, although only high-expenditure single-source drugs that have been approved for at least 7 years (11 years for biologics) can be selected by CMS for negotiation, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. The negotiated prices, which will first become effective in 2026, will be capped at a statutory ceiling price representing a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. The law will also, beginning in October 2023, penalize drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D drugs at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges.
 
Employees-Human Capital

RETINALGENIX TECHNOLOGIES INC.
 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE A – HISTORY, BUSINESS PURPOSE, LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN
 
RetinalGenix Technologies Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, was formed in November 2017 by Sanovas Ophthalmology, LLC (“Sanovas Ophthalmology”), a majority owned subsidiary of Sanovas Inc. (“Sanovas”), a privately held research and development incubator. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, a substantial portion of the operations of the Company were conducted by Sanovas, who invoices the Company for costs and expenses paid for on behalf of the Company and costs and expenses allocated to the Company for services performed on behalf of the Company.
 
The Company was formed to develop technologies to diagnose and treat ophthalmic disorders. The Company sublicensed certain technology initially developed by Sanovas from Sanovas Ophthalmology – See Note C. Since 2018, the Company has been developing its screening device and home monitoring and physician alert system.
 
In October 2021, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration Statement”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to which it registered for resale shares of common stock, including shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants. The Company did not raise any cash from the resale of the securities offered by the Registration Statement, and accordingly, the previously deferred offering costs were applied against the proceeds of the shares of common stock sold in 2021 pursuant to the Company’s previous private offering of securities.
 
On October 8, 2019, the Company entered into an option exchange agreement (the “Option Exchange Agreement”) with Diopsys, Inc. (“Diopsys”) pursuant to which the Company shall issue Diopsys an option to purchase up to 10% of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock and Diopsys shall grant the Company an option to purchase up to 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Diopsys on the Closing Date (the “Option Exchange”). “Closing Date” means a date that is within 30 days of the date that all of the contingencies set forth in the Option Exchange Agreement are satisfied including, but not limited to, approval of a product by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In addition, pursuant to the Option Exchange Agreement, upon the closing of the Option Exchange, the Company shall enter into an exclusive distribution agreement with Diopsys pursuant to which Diopsys shall act as the Company’s exclusive distributor of such product. On February 14, 2022, the Company entered into a Termination of Option Exchange Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) with Diopsys pursuant to which the prior Option Exchange Agreement between the Company and Diopsys dated October 8, 2019 (the “Option Exchange Agreement”) was terminated effective immediately and of no further force and effect, and neither party has any past, current or future obligations or liabilities to the other (or any other person or entity) with respect to any rights, obligations or any of the transactions contemplated in the Option Exchange Agreement. At the time of such termination, none of the conditions in the Option Exchange Agreement were satisfied and no options thereunder had been issued to either the Company or Diopsys. In addition, the Exclusive Distribution Agreement to be entered into between the Company and Diopsys and referred to in the Option Exchange Agreement has not been negotiated and as of the second quarter of 2022, there are no plans to move forward with Diopsys.
 
On December 27, 2021, RetinalGenix Technologies Inc. entered into an exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Sanovas Ophthalmology pursuant to which the Company exchanged 28,014,540 shares of common stock held by Sanovas Ophthalmology for a pre-funded warrant (the “Pre-funded Warrant”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 28,014,540 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Pre-funded Warrant is immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share and terminates when exercised in full.
 
On July 5, 2022, RetinalGenix Technologies Inc. entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Dr. Lawrence Perich pursuant to which it acquired all the outstanding shares of DNA/GPS Inc., a pharmacogenetics company based in Tampa, Florida (“DNA/GPS”), in exchange for the issuance of 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The acquisition of DNA/GPS combines DNA/GPS’ genetic mapping capabilities with the Company’s retinal imaging capabilities. The combined technology is expected to have the ability to screen, monitor and provide data to profile trends and create diagnostic markers for systemic and retinal disorders in the cardiovascular, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson and other diseases. The markers and data analysis are rapid and cost effective, thereby eliminating expensive diagnostic equipment such as MRI or CT scanning. The results are to confidential to the patient and anonymous for any third party without permission of the patient. The Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition in 2022. The estimated fair value of the transaction was $2,000,000 plus legal fees associated with the transaction of $32,889 is recorded as acquired in-process research and development costs in the associated consolidated statement of operations.
 
Liquidity and Going Concern
 
The Company has had net losses since inception and has an accumulated deficit of approximately $9,018,000 at December 31, 2022. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 and December 31 2021, the Company had liabilities of approximately $1,069,000 and $470,000, respectively, the majority of which is with related parties. The Company has minimal cash at December 31, 2022 and remains dependent on Sanovas for much of its operations. The Company expects that operating losses and negative cash flows from operations will occur for at least the next several years, and the Company will need to access additional funds to achieve its strategic goals with respect to the sublicensed technology. The Company commenced private offerings of shares of its common stock raising net proceeds of approximately $1,083,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021, and $60,500 in the year ended December 31, 2022 - See Note D. In February 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with an investment banker to raise funds for the Company which led to the private offering of shares mentioned above. The Company is in discussions with investment bankers and individual investors with respect to raising additional capital for the Company and potentially up-listing to the NASDAQ exchange.

F-7
---


Sanovas has paid a significant portion of the Company’s operating expenses through December 2022, and was owed approximately $428,000 as of December 31, 2022 by the Company. The Company also issued shares of its common stock to offset amounts due to Sanovas for payment of expenses on behalf of the Company of $390,358 in June 2021 and $353,432 in May 2022 and $586,370 in November 2022 (see Note C).
 
As of the date of this report, the Company does not have adequate resources to fund its operations through April 2024 without considering any potential future milestone payments that it may receive under any new collaborations that it may enter into in the future or any future capital raising transactions. The Company will need to raise additional funding to complete the development of its products and commence the market launch, assuming regulatory approval is obtained. The Company does not know whether additional financing will be available when needed, whether it will be available on favorable terms, or if it will be available at all. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
A summary of significant accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements is as follows:
 
1. Basis of Presentation
 
The Company’s financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). As of December 31, 2022, there have been no material changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies from those that were disclosed in the 2021 Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, DNA/GPS, Inc. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
2. Cash Equivalents
 
For purpose of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
3. Offering Costs
 
Deferred offering costs are expenses directly related to an expected financing. These costs consisted of legal fees that the Company capitalized. These costs are offset against the resultant capital raised.
4. Use of Estimates
 
In preparing the Company’s financial statements in conformity with US GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
5. Income Taxes
 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
 
The Company follows the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740-10 Income Taxes. ASC Topic 740-10 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. It also provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, and classification of amounts relating to uncertain tax positions, accounting for and disclosure of interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosures. The application of that guidance did not result in the recognition of any unrecognized tax benefits At December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. The Company’s policy is to expense any penalties and interest associated with this topic. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were no amounts accrued for penalties and interest.
 
6. Income (Loss) Per Common Share
 
The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share (“EPS”). Under the provisions of ASC 260, basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) for the period by the weighted-average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. However, common shares that are considered anti-dilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted EPS. Since the Company had a loss during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the basic and diluted net loss per share is the same.

F-8
---


Potentially dilutive securities not included in the computation of loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2022, include stock options to purchase 2,360,000 shares of common stock, pre-funded warrant to purchase 28,014,540 shares of common stock, and warrants to purchase 161,500 shares of common stock. Potentially dilutive securities not included in the computation of loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2021 included 3,000,000 shares of Series F preferred stock, stock options to purchase 1,882,500 shares of common stock, and warrants to purchase 212,500 shares of common stock. The shares of common stock potentially issuable to Diopsys upon the resolution of specified contingencies and exercise of stock options are also excluded from the loss per share calculation for the year ended December 31, 2021.
 
7. Stock-based compensation:
 
The Company recognizes expense for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Stock-Based Compensation. For stock-based awards, the Company calculates the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The expense is recognized over the service period for awards expected to vest. The estimate of stock-based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from original estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates are revised. Stock options granted to non-employee consultants are revalued at the end of each reporting period until vested and the changes in their fair value are recorded as adjustments to expense over the related vesting period.
 
8. Research and Development costs:
 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred in obtaining technology licenses outside of business combinations are charged to research and development expense as acquired in-process research and development if the technology licensed has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use.
  licensed has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use.
 9. Property and Equipment:
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives (3 years), once the asset is placed in service. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the economic useful life of the related assets, are charged to operations as incurred, and expenditures which extend the economic life are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the costs and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss on disposal is recognized in the statement of operations for the respective period.
 
The Company’s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount.
 
10. Recent Accounting Pronouncements:
 
The following pronouncement may have an impact on the accounting policies of the Company:
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” (“ASU 2016-02”). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases. ASU 2016-02 will also require new qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10 “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases” (“ASU 2018-10”), ASU No. 2018-11 “Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements” (“ASU 2018-11”) in July 2018, and ASU No. 2018-20 “Leases (Topic 842) - Narrow Scope Improvements for Lessors” (“ASU 2018-20”) in December 2018. ASU 2018-10 and ASU 2018-20 provide certain amendments that affect narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2016-02. ASU 2018-11 allows all entities adopting ASU 2016-02 to choose an additional (and optional) transition method of adoption, under which an entity initially applies the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Pursuant to ASU 2019-10 the effective date for ASC 842 was deferred an additional year. The Company expects to recognize operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet upon adoption of this ASU when it obtains a lease. The Company is currently evaluating these ASUs and their impact on its financial statements, but does not expect it will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
 
A variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard-setting organizations. Due to the tentative and preliminary nature of those proposed standards, management has not determined whether the implementation of such proposed standards would be material to the financial statements of the Company.
 
11. Reclassification:
 
The Company reclassified approximately $68,000 of costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021 from general and administrative expense to research and development costs to conform to the current presentation.

Shareholders’ notes payable – See Note G
 
NOTE D - COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK
 
Pursuant to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation”), filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on January 8, 2018, the Company is authorized to issue 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 80,000,000 shares of common stock each with a par value of $0.0001 per share. The Company has designated 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock as Series F preferred stock.
 
Pursuant to the terms of an employment agreement dated January 1, 2012 (the “Effective Date”) by and between Sanovas and Lawrence Gerrans, the then President and Chief Executive Officer of Sanovas (the “Original Employment Agreement”), in consideration for Mr. Gerrans’ services, Mr. Gerrans was to receive, among other consideration, the following equity securities: (i) 441,177 shares of restricted common stock of each of the wholly-owned subsidiaries of Sanovas, as of the Effective Date (the “Affiliate Subsidiaries”), representing 7.5% of the total equity capital of each such subsidiary issued and outstanding as of the date of grant; and (ii) 5,000 shares of Series F preferred stock of Sanovas and each of the Affiliate Subsidiaries. The Company was incorporated in Delaware on November 17, 2017, subsequent to the Effective Date, and as such these shares were never issued by the Company because the Company was not an Affiliate Subsidiary of Sanovas. Thereafter, in May 2015, Mr. Gerrans’ Original Employment Agreement was amended and restated with an effective date of January 1, 2012 (the “Amended and Restated Employment Agreement”), the same as the Effective Date of the Original Employment Agreement. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, in consideration for Mr. Gerrans’ services, Mr. Gerrans was to receive, among other consideration, the following equity securities: (i) 7.5% of the total equity capital of each of Sanovas’ Affiliate Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date or thereafter formed (collectively, the “New Subsidiaries”); and (ii) 5,000 shares of Series F preferred stock of Sanovas, each of the Affiliate Subsidiaries and each of the New Subsidiaries, including the Company. Subsequently, pursuant to a board resolution dated December 1, 2017 approved by Lawrence Gerrans, the Company’s then Chief Executive Officer, President and sole director, in 2018 the Company issued 27,000,000 shares of its common stock to Sanovas Ophthalmology LLC, and issued 3,000,000 shares of its Series F preferred stock to Halo Management LLC (“Halo”), an entity owned by Mr. Gerrans, for certain enumerated consideration that was purported to have been provided. Thereafter, and in part based upon the evidence and testimony presented, and verdict and conviction rendered, in the Criminal Action (discussed below), including, but not limited to, the fact that Mr. Gerrans misled and coerced the board of Sanovas regarding the terms and need for approval of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, the Company’s board of directors, acting in concert with the board of directors of Sanovas, carried out an investigation with respect to actions taken by Mr. Gerrans and have determined that Halo did not provide the Company with valid consideration for the Series F preferred stock, and the Company disputes whether any of the shares of the Company issued to Halo were validly issued.
 
In January 2020, a jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California found Mr. Gerrans guilty, in a criminal proceeding (the “Criminal Action”), on 12 felony counts of wire fraud, money laundering, perjury, contempt of court, witness tampering, and obstruction of justice in connection with his activities as an officer and director of Sanovas. Thereafter, in November 2020, Sanovas commenced an action in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Action”) against Halo and Mr. Gerrans seeking an order declaring that any rights that Halo and/or Mr. Gerrans may have with respect to any equity securities in Sanovas and each of its affiliated subsidiaries (including, but not limited to, the Company) are void or voidable and may be cancelled. The Delaware Action is currently still pending.

On November 21,2021, the Company’s Board of Directors resolved to rescind the 3,000,000 shares of Series F preferred stock purported to be issued to Halo Management Group LLC for lack of contract consideration. The Company is aware that the management/ownership of Halo Management Group LLC may dispute this decision however, the Company is prepared to defend its decision in this case. In addition, the Company reserves the right to void the shares and adjust its filings accordingly if necessary.

Conversion:
 
Each share of Series F preferred stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time and from time to time into shares of common stock at a conversion rate as is determined by dividing the Series F Original Issue Price by the Series F Conversion Price. “Series F Original Issue Price” initially means $0.01 and “Series F Conversion Price” initially means $0.01, as adjusted for any dilutive transaction such as stock splits, certain dividends, mergers or acquisitions.
 
All of the outstanding shares of Series F preferred stock will automatically convert into shares of the Company’s common stock upon the consummation of an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in gross proceeds of at least $15,000,000 to the Company or upon written consent of at least 67% of the Series F preferred shareholders.

$ | 1.00 | | 2,360,000 | | 7.2 Years | | 1,204,444 | 525,000

 
The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant to be $0.53 per share using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumption weighted-averages in 2021:
  SCHEDULE OF STOCK OPTIONS FAIR VALUE ASSUMPTIONS
 
Risk-free interest rates | | 1.2% - 2.42 | %
-----------------------------+---+-----------------+--
Expected life in years | | 5.0 | 
Expected volatility | | 73.1 | %
Expected dividend yield | | 0 | %
Fair value common stock | $ | 1.00 | 

 
The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant to be $0.56 per share using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumption weighted-averages in 2022:
 

Risk-free interest rates | | 2.19 | %
-----------------------------+---+------+--
Expected life in years | | 3.5 | 
Expected volatility | | 80 | %
Expected dividend yield | | 0 | %
Fair value common stock | $ | 1.00 | 

 
The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term commensurate with the expected term of the award. Management has estimated expected volatility based on similar comparable industry sector averages. Expected life of the option represents the period of time options are expected to be outstanding. The estimate for dividend yield is 0% because the Company has not historically paid, and does not intend to pay a dividend on its common stock in the foreseeable future.
 
NOTE F - WARRANTS
 
In 2021, the Company finalized the issuance of warrants to purchase 150,000 shares of common stock at $1.10 per share which are fully vested as of December 31, 2021, and exercisable over 7 years, to a consulting firm. The fair value of such warrants was estimated on the date of grant to be $0.61 per share using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumption weighted-averages in 2021:
 SCHEDULE OF WARRANTS FAIR VALUE ASSUMPTIONS
 
Risk-free interest rates | | 2.42 | %

The estimate for dividend yield is 0% because the Company has not historically paid, and does not intend to pay a dividend on its common stock in the foreseeable future. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $75,000 and $0 in the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2022, there is no remaining compensation expense to be recognized.

Pre-funded Warrant
 
On December 27, 2021, the Company entered into an exchange agreement with Sanovas Ophthalmology (the “Exchange Agreement”) pursuant to which it exchanged 28,014,540 shares of common stock (the “Exchange Securities”) held by Sanovas Ophthalmology for a pre-funded warrant (the “Pre-funded Warrant”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 28,014,540 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Pre-funded Warrant is immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share and terminates when exercised in full. As part of the Exchange Agreement, Sanovas Ophthalmology relinquished any and all rights related to the Exchange Securities.
NOTE G – SHAREHOLDERS’ NOTES PAYABLE
 
During 2021, the Company borrowed an aggregate of $73,000 from several stockholders pursuant to note agreements bearing interest at 8% per annum and maturing December 31, 2022. The Company has informally extended the maturity date to December 31, 2023 under the same terms. During the year ended December 31, 2022, one of the noteholders exercised outstanding warrants with an aggregate exercise price of $25,000 through the offset of the note payable due to them from the Company, such that $48,000 remain outstanding at December 31, 2022. Interest expense amounted to $5,140 and $2,619 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The accrued interest payable at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $7,759 and $2,619, respectively.
NOTE H – INCOME TAXES
 
The Company had no current income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to operating losses. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is zero, as the deferred tax benefits are fully offset by the valuation allowance against such deferred income tax assets.
 
At December 31, 2022, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards (“NOL”) of approximately $4,499,000 for federal income tax purposes of which $3,724,000 has no expiration date, $775,000 which begins to expire in 2034, and approximately $4,499,000 for state income tax purposes which begins to expire in 2030.
 
The resulting net deferred tax assets of approximately $1,714,000 ($1,350,000 applicable to net operating loss carryforwards, $236,000 applicable to stock-based compensation and $128,000 applicable to accruals) and $1,193,000 ($992,000 applicable to net operating loss carryforwards, $158,000 applicable to stock based compensation and $43,000 applicable to accruals) at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, has been fully reserved due to the uncertainty of future realization. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $521,000 and $389,000 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
 
 
F-15
----


Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), the availability of the Company’s NOL carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations against taxable income in future periods, which could substantially limit the eventual utilization of such carryforwards. The Company has not analyzed the historical or potential impact of its equity financings on beneficial ownership and therefore no determination has been made whether the NOL carryforward is subject to any Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation. To the extent there is a limitation, there would be a reduction in the deferred tax asset with an offsetting reduction in the valuation allowance.
 
The Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. The open years for tax examination are 2017 and thereafter.
 
NOTE I - CONTINGENCY
 
The Company received a claim against it relating to a former indirect vendor. The Company believes the claim is without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself. The Company does not believe the claim would have a material impact on the financial condition of the Company. NOTE J - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
The Company has evaluated the effect of events and transactions subsequent to December 31, 2022 through the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements, and determined that no subsequent events have occurred that require recognition in the consolidated financial statements.
