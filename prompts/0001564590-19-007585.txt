Item 1. Business. 
Business Overview
 
Savara is an orphan lung disease company. Our current drug development pipeline comprises Molgradex, an inhaled granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (“GM-CSF”) in Phase 3 for autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (“aPAP”), and in Phase 2a for nontuberculous mycobacterial (“NTM”) lung infection and AeroVanc, a Phase 3-stage inhaled vancomycin for treatment of persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (“MRSA”) lung infection in individuals living with cystic fibrosis (“CF”). Our strategy involves expanding our pipeline of potentially best-in-class products through indication expansion, strategic development partnerships and product acquisitions, with the goal of becoming a leading company in the orphan lung disease market. Our management team has significant experience in orphan drug development and pulmonary medicine, identifying unmet needs, developing and acquiring new product candidates and effectively advancing them to approvals and commercialization. 
 The table below summarizes the current status and anticipated milestones for our primary drug development candidates.
 
Corporate Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a leader in orphan lung disease therapeutics through the development and commercialization of novel, best-in-class medicines that address unmet medical needs in this field. The key elements of our strategy include:

• | Advance current pipeline. Advancing Savara’s development pipeline is our highest priority. With Molgradex for aPAP and AeroVanc, we are focused on completing the current Phase 3 studies and, pending positive results, preparing to submit a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) and New Drug Application (“NDA”), respectively, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), ensuring our product supply chains will support commercialization, and preparing for potential commercialization of Molgradex and AeroVanc in the U.S., throughout Europe, Japan and other countries. Regarding Molgradex for NTM, our focus is on the completion of the current Phase 2a study and, pending positive results, preparing for and executing a well-controlled Phase 2b study.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue Molgradex and AeroVanc indication expansion. While our immediate priority is to obtain regulatory approvals in the primary indications described above, we are exploring the utility of Molgradex and AeroVanc in other difficult-to-treat lung infections.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand the product pipeline through strategic product acquisitions. Concurrent with our indication expansion efforts, our strategy includes growing our development pipeline through strategic partnerships and product acquisitions. A key priority has been to enhance the delivery of known chemical entities or drug classes, e.g., changing the route of delivery of a drug directly into the lungs, for the treatment of serious or life-threatening lung diseases. While we have developed an internal core competence in inhaled drug development, we are technology and route-of-delivery agnostic. Future product acquisition decisions will be based on the unmet medical need within a specific disease, the market opportunity and the ability to rapidly develop and commercialize a product candidate.

• | Outsource capital intensive operations. We will continue to pursue the development and manufacturing of our product candidates by outsourcing most clinical development and all manufacturing operations. We believe our business model has facilitated effective development of our pipeline by using high quality specialist vendors and consultants in a capital efficient manner.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish internal sales and marketing capabilities to commercialize our products in the U.S. & EU. Pending FDA approval, we plan to commercialize our products through an internal specialty sales force in the U.S. Pending European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) approval, we expect to commercialize Molgradex and AeroVanc in certain key markets in the EU and may engage with strategic partners to optimize sales and promotion activities in the remaining EU territories.

Molgradex – aPAP
 
Our lead product candidate, Molgradex, an inhaled formulation of recombinant human GM-CSF, is being developed for the treatment of autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (“aPAP”). Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (“PAP”) is a rare lung disease characterized by the build-up of lung surfactant in the alveoli (or air sacs) of the lungs. There are different types of PAP, of which aPAP is the most common. 
 
Molgradex is currently being investigated in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study, called IMPALA, for the treatment of aPAP. Molgradex has been granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of aPAP in the U.S. and the EU, which allows for seven and ten years of exclusivity from approval, respectively. In addition, Savara has exclusive access to the PARI Investigational eFlow Nebulizer System for this indication along with a proprietary cell bank for molgramostim, an inhaled, non-glycosylated form of GM-CSF and the active drug substance of Molgradex.
 
There are approximately 2,200 PAP patients in the U.S., with the vast majority having aPAP. The disease process underlying aPAP involves an autoimmune response against GM-CSF, a naturally occurring protein that functions to clear excess surfactant from the alveoli. The autoimmune response suppresses the stimulating activity of GM-CSF on lung macrophages, resulting in the accumulation of excess surfactant. The surfactant consists of proteins and lipids and is an important physiological substance that lines the inside of the alveoli to prevent the lungs from collapsing. In a healthy lung, the old and inactivated surfactant is cleared and digested by immune cells called alveolar macrophages. Alveolar macrophages need to be stimulated by GM-CSF to function properly in clearing surfactant. In aPAP, GM-CSF is neutralized by antibodies against GM-CSF, rendering the macrophages unable to perform their tasks. As a result, an excess of surfactant accumulates in the alveoli, obstructs gas exchange, and results in shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance. Patients may also experience chronic cough, as well as episodes of fever, chest pain, or coughing blood, especially if secondary lung infection develops. In the long term, the disease can lead to serious complications, including lung fibrosis and the need for a lung transplant. There are no currently approved therapies for the treatment of aPAP. The current standard-of-care is a surgical procedure called whole lung lavage (“WLL”), which entails washing out the lungs bronchoscopically with saline, segment-by-segment, under general anesthesia. By nature, WLL is an invasive and inconvenient procedure that requires highly experienced physicians and hospitalization at specialist sites. Based on published investigator-sponsored treatment experience with inhaled GM-CSF, we believe Molgradex has the potential to replace the inactivated GM-CSF in aPAP patients, thereby restoring the surfactant clearing activity of the alveolar macrophages, and become the first-line treatment-of-choice for aPAP. 
 
The pivotal Phase 3 IMPALA clinical study is being conducted in 18 countries including the U.S., Japan, and throughout Europe. IMPALA is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Molgradex with placebo in patients with aPAP. In 2017, we announced our expedited U.S. development strategy for Molgradex, which enables the ongoing IMPALA study to serve as a pivotal study also for U.S. registration purposes. In support of this strategy, we submitted an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application to the FDA in December 2017 to expand the study into U.S. sites. The primary endpoint of the study is the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, or (A-a)DO2, a commonly used measure of oxygenation impairment. In addition, the FDA will focus its review on three key secondary endpoints that will be assessed to show improvement in clinical symptoms and function. Patients are randomized to receive treatment for up to 24 weeks in one of three treatment arms: 1) Molgradex 300 µg administered once daily, 2) Molgradex 300 µg and matching placebo administered daily in 7-day intermittent cycles of each, or 3) inhaled placebo administered once daily. Patient enrollment was completed for IMPALA in October 2018 with a total of 139 patients. Topline results are expected at the end of Q2 2019. 
 
In March 2018, we initiated the IMPALA-X study. This open-label extension study allows patients who are rolling off IMPALA to continue treatment for up to three additional years and will determine the long-term safety and utilization of Molgradex in patients with aPAP. Active enrollment in this study continues.

Molgradex - NTM
 
Molgradex is also being investigated for the treatment of NTM lung infection in an open-label, non-controlled Phase 2a study called OPTIMA. NTM lung infection is a rare and serious lung disorder associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Nontuberculous mycobacteria are naturally-occurring organisms, and NTM lung infection can occur when the organism (found in the environment) is inhaled and an individual develops a slowly progressive and destructive lung disease. NTM lung infection is typically characterized by cough, fatigue, and weight loss. NTM infections often become chronic and require long courses of multiple antibiotics, and despite aggressive treatment regimens, treatment failure rates are high and recurrence of infection common. Chronic NTM lung infection can have a significant impact on quality of life. There are up to 80,000 individuals affected in the U.S., and the most common types of NTM lung infection involve Mycobacterium avium complex (“MAC”), and Mycobacterium abscessus (“MABSC”). There have been few advancements in new systemic treatments for NTM lung infection. 
 
NTM lung infections are a considerable therapeutic challenge due to the unique ability of these bacteria to evade the normal killing mechanisms of alveolar macrophages, a type of immune cell responsible for killing bacteria in the lungs. There is increasing scientific literature suggesting that GM-CSF plays an important role in enhancing the ability of macrophages to clear mycobacteria.1 For instance, GM-CSF knock out mice inoculated with MABSC develop a chronic lung disease resembling human chronic infection, whereas wild type mice with intact GM-CSF production typically clear the bacteria quickly and fail to develop chronic infection. In animal studies, GM-CSF has been shown to kill NTM with similar efficacy compared to commonly used NTM antibiotics, and the simultaneous use of GM-CSF with antibiotics can further improve the antibacterial effect of either GM-CSF or antibiotics given alone.
 
In two published clinical case reports in the European Respiratory Journal by Dr. Wylam of the Mayo Clinic,2 inhaled GM-CSF was shown to eradicate or dramatically reduce the bacterial burden in patients with chronic MABSC lung infection. This suggests that the promising animal data may be translatable to humans, and the potential therapeutic role of GM-CSF in NTM lung infection warrants more intensive investigation. 
 
The multi-center OPTIMA study in non-CF patients was initiated in Q1 2018 and is investigating the efficacy of Molgradex on reduction of NTM bacterial load in sputum, NTM sputum culture conversion to negative, exercise capacity, patient reported outcomes and safety. Two groups of patients were recruited for the study - those on anti-mycobacterial treatment and those not on anti-mycobacterial treatment. Both groups receive Molgradex 300 µg administered once daily. The primary endpoint is sputum culture conversion during the treatment period, defined as at least three con

secutive negative sputum samples. Interim results from the OPTIMA study were disclosed in December 2018. Based on the microbiological data and safety profile, which provides the basis to continue treating patients for a longer period of time, the duration 
of the OPTIMA study was extended from 24 to 48 weeks, with a 12-week follow up period at the end of treatment. This increases the ability to observe a more robust anti-infective effect, including culture conversions. Final results from the study are expected in the first quarter of 2020.
 
In Q3 2018, the IND application for Molgradex in CF-affected patients with chronic NTM lung infection was accepted by the FDA. A Phase 2a study of Molgradex in CF-affected patients with NTM lung infection is expected to initiate in Q1 2019.
 
AeroVanc 
 
Our second Phase 3 product candidate, AeroVanc, is a vancomycin hydrochloride inhalation powder. AeroVanc is the first inhaled antibiotic in development for the treatment of persistent MRSA lung infection in individuals living with CF. AeroVanc was granted Orphan Drug Designation and Qualified Infectious Disease Product (“QIDP”) status for the treatment of persistent MRSA lung infection in individuals living with CF in the U.S. Orphan Drug Designation makes AeroVanc eligible for seven years of exclusivity from approval in the U.S., and the QIDP designation makes AeroVanc eligible for an additional five years of exclusivity in the U.S. In 2017, a composition of matter patent covering AeroVanc was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), which affords us important protection for the program in the largest market for the product (the U.S.), augments our market protection strategy and will not expire earlier than 2032.

CF is a genetic disease that involves sticky mucus buildup in the lungs, persistent lung infections and permanent and progressive respiratory disability. There are approximately 30,000 individuals affected by CF in the U.S., and MRSA infection has become increasingly common in people living with CF, with a prevalence of approximately 26%. Persistent MRSA infection in people living with CF is associated with increased use of intravenous (“IV”) antibiotics, increased hospitalizations, a more rapid rate of decline in lung function, and shortened life-expectancy. Due to the lung pathology associated with CF, persistent MRSA lung infection is difficult to eradicate or manage using oral or IV antibiotics, and there is currently no standard-of-care to manage this condition. Whereas inhaled antibiotics have become a cornerstone of treating the most prevalent chronic pathogen in individuals living with CF, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (“Pseudomonas”), there are no approved inhaled antibiotics addressing MRSA lung infection. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in individuals living with CF with persistent MRSA infection, AeroVanc met a primary endpoint to reduce MRSA density in sputum, and showed encouraging trends of improvement in lung function and respiratory symptoms, as well as prolongation of the time-to-use of other antibiotics, with best responses in patients under 21 years of age. 
 
AeroVanc is currently being investigated in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study, called AVAIL, in the U.S. and Canada for the treatment of persistent MRSA lung infection in individuals living with CF. The study began enrolling patients at U.S. and Canadian clinical sites in September 2017 and December 2017, respectively. The study is expected to enroll approximately 200 patients (150 patients ≤ 21 years old, 50 patients > 21 years old). During Period 1 of the study, patients are randomly assigned in a blinded 1:1 fashion to receive either AeroVanc (30 mg) twice daily, or placebo, by inhalation for 24 weeks or 3 dosing cycles. A dosing cycle is defined as 28 days of treatment followed by 28 days of observation. During Period 2 of the study, patients receive open-label AeroVanc (30 mg) twice daily for an additional 24 weeks or 3 dosing cycles, to evaluate the long-term safety of AeroVanc. The primary endpoint is the mean absolute change in Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (“FEV1”) percent predicted from baseline, which will be analyzed sequentially at week 4 (the end of cycle 1), week 12 (the end of cycle 2), and at week 20 (the end of cycle 3). Analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on patients 6‒21 years of age. Secondary endpoints include: (i) time-to-use of another antibiotic medication (oral, IV, and/or inhaled) for pulmonary infection, (ii) the number of successful FEV1-response cycles a patient achieves over Period 1 (weeks 4, 12, and 20), (iii) relative change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted at weeks 4, 12, and 20, (iv) change from baseline Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised scores at weeks 4, 12, and 20 and (v) change from Baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Symptom Diary-Chronic Respiratory Symptom Score at weeks 4, 12, and 20. We anticipate that AVAIL patient enrollment will be completed in Q3 2019, with top line results expected in Q2 of 2020.

Background on aPAP

PAP is a rare lung disease, which affects up to seven out of a million people in the U.S.3, and has a similar prevalence in Japan4. PAP is characterized by the build-up of lung surfactant in the alveoli, or air sacs, of the lungs. The surfactant consists of proteins and lipids and is an important physiological substance that coats the inside of the alveoli to prevent the lungs from collapsing. The lungs continuously produce new active surfactant. In a healthy lung, the old and inactivated surfactant is cleared and digested by immune cells called alveolar macrophages. However, in lungs of patients with aPAP, the macrophages fail to clear the surfactant from the alveoli, leading to gradual accumulation of excess surfactant in the alveoli. The root cause of aPAP is an autoimmune response against a naturally occurring protein in the body, GM-CSF. Pulmonary macrophages need to be stimulated by GM-CSF to function properly, but in aPAP, GM-CSF is deactivated by antibodies against GM-CSF, rendering the macrophages unable to perform their tasks, such as clearing the surfactant from the alveoli.
 
aPAP most commonly affects men in early middle age, but both sexes and patients of any age can be affected. As a result of the accumulation of excess surfactant, gas exchange in the lungs is obstructed, and patients start to experience shortness of breath, and decreased exercise tolerance. Shortness of breath is typically first observed upon exertion, but as the disease progresses, also at rest. Patients may experience chronic cough, as well as episodes of fever, chest pain, or coughing blood, especially if secondary lung infection develops. In the long term, the disease can lead to serious complications, including lung fibrosis and the need for lung transplant. Mortality due to aPAP has decreased over the last decades with better clinical management, but in rare cases serious lung infections or respiratory insufficiency may lead to death.

Current treatment options for aPAP
 
The current standard-of-care for aPAP is a surgical procedure called Whole Lung Lavage (“WLL”), which entails washing out the lungs with saline under general anesthesia. WLL is an invasive and inconvenient procedure that requires highly experienced physicians at specialist sites. The procedure is conducted in an operating room, requiring hospitalization and admission to intensive care after the procedure. In many patients, WLL only provides temporary symptomatic relief, and once the lungs refill with surfactant, the WLL procedure needs to be repeated.
 
As there are no approved drug treatments available for aPAP, we believe there is a high need for a convenient and efficacious medicinal treatment. We believe that inhalation of GM-CSF directly into the lungs has the potential to replace the inactivated GM-CSF, and thereby restore the surfactant clearing activity of the alveolar macrophages. As a result, we believe that inhaled GM-CSF has the potential for considerable improvement in oxygenation and exercise tolerance. An injectable form of GM-CSF, sargramostim, is approved and on the market in the U.S. for IV and subcutaneous administration for the treatment of neutropenia caused by cancer chemotherapy, but there is currently no approved inhalation formulation of GM-CSF.
 
The potential benefits of inhaled GM-CSF in aPAP, together with the availability of sargramostim, have stimulated independent clinicians and academic researchers in the U.S., Europe, and Japan to study the safety and efficacy of GM-CSF, administered by inhalation, in aPAP patients. Several such investigator-sponsored, open-label clinical studies and case studies of inhaled GM-CSF treatment have been published, with promising results on the efficacy and safety of the treatment.5,6,7 In total, treatment of more than 80 aPAP patients with inhaled GM-CSF has been reported in open-label studies or retrospective cohorts, as well as several individual case reports. Whereas the majority of the patients described in the literature received sargramostim, the results indicate that both sargramostim and molgramostim have the potential for a positive impact on oxygenation and clinical symptoms in aPAP patients.
 
According to our review of published literature, few safety issues related with molgramostim or sargramostim inhalation in patients with aPAP have been reported. However, there is still limited information available on the long-term safety of inhaled GM-CSF. In indications other than aPAP, more than 100 patients, mainly with a cancer diagnosis, have received inhaled sargramostim, in doses up to 4000 µg/day. Pulmonary toxicity was the most frequently reported toxicity at high doses. An increase in both number and severity of adverse events with increasing dose has been observed. However, due to the underlying diseases it was often difficult for the investigators to assess causality of the adverse event cases.
 
Molgradex Product Description
 
Molgradex is a novel inhaled formulation of recombinant human GM-CSF being developed for the treatment of aPAP. The active drug substance, molgramostim, is a non-glycosylated form of GM-CSF. GM-CSF is an endogenous growth factor that stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells (blood and immune cells), mainly granulocytic and monocytic cell lines, which serve as the body’s first line of defense against bacteria and viruses, and also function to clear cellular debris and waste substances from the body. Molgramostim is produced in a strain of Escherichia coli bearing a genetically engineered plasmid containing a human GM-CSF gene.
 
Molgradex, is a sterile nebulizer solution in a vial containing 300 µg of molgramostim, designed to be administered once daily by inhalation via a high efficiency Investigational eFlow Nebulizer System (PARI Pharma GmbH, Germany). The PARI eFlow Nebulizer system for use with investigational drug products is a reusable electronic inhalation system that has been optimized for administration of Molgradex.
 
Molgradex was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA in October 2012, and by the EMA in July 2013, for the treatment of aPAP. Since 2014, Molgradex has been available in several European countries for the treatment of aPAP for named patients following unsolicited physician requests.

We anticipate that Molgradex will be used as a long-term therapy in patients with aPAP. The optimal duration of treatment is currently not known, and is likely to vary between patients depending on the disease severity and the natural course of their disease. Molgradex treatment may not entirely eliminate the need for WLL in all patients, but based on interviews conducted by us, PAP centers that have experimented with long-term inhaled GM-CSF have seen a considerable reduction of WLL procedures.
 
Molgradex Key Advantages 
 
Building upon the published investigator-sponsored treatment experience with inhaled GM-CSF, we believe Molgradex has the potential to become the treatment of choice for aPAP. Molgradex has the following characteristics that we believe will contribute to the clinical profile of the product candidate, as well as facilitate our regulatory approval and successful commercialization. 
Specifically, Molgradex offers:
  
• | Strong product foundation, applying a previously approved active drug substance class and previously approved drug delivery technology.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | GM-CSF delivery directly to the lungs, the primary site of macrophage function deficiency, which we believe can result in high clinical efficacy with limited systemic adverse effects.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High efficiency nebulizer providing a fast and convenient method of administration, which is highly desirable for long-term treatment in a chronic disease, such as aPAP.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Eligibility for strong market protection via orphan drug status, a proprietary cell bank used in the production of the drug substance, and an exclusive device supply agreement.

Clinical Development of Molgradex ‒ aPAP
 
Ongoing Phase 3 IMPALA Study
 
We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study of Molgradex, called IMPALA, in 18 countries including the U.S., Japan, and throughout Europe. IMPALA is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Molgradex with placebo in patients with aPAP. The study began enrolling patients in Europe and Japan in 2016. In 2017, we announced our expedited U.S. development strategy for Molgradex, which enables the ongoing IMPALA study to serve as a pivotal study for U.S. registration purposes. In support of this strategy, we submitted an IND application to the FDA in December 2017 to expand the study into U.S. sites. The primary endpoint of the study is (A-a)DO2, a commonly used measure of oxygenation impairment. IMPALA is over 90% powered to detect a 10mmHg change in (A-a)DO2 from baseline versus placebo. In addition, the FDA will focus its review on three key secondary endpoints that will be assessed to show improvement in clinical symptoms and function. To help ensure adequate statistical power by confirming or modifying the study sample size, the IND submission included a blinded interim check of the variability of two of the key secondary endpoints - the six-minute walk distance and St. George’s respiratory questionnaire. This blinded analysis indicated that the original sample size of 90 patients was sufficient to achieve 90% power for one of the two secondary endpoints. However, to achieve 90% power for both secondary endpoints, and thereby further increase the likelihood of a robust and convincing study outcome, the sample size was increased to a total of 135 patients, or 45 patients per treatment arm. Patients are randomized to receive treatment for up to 24 weeks in one of three treatment arms: 1) Molgradex 300 µg administered once daily, 2) Molgradex 300 µg and matching placebo administered daily in 7-day intermittent cycles of each, or 3) inhaled placebo administered once daily. At the end of the 24-week double-blind period, all treatment arms roll into a 24-week open-label follow up period and receive Molgradex 300 ug administered daily in 7-day intermittent cycles.
 
Patient enrollment in IMPALA is complete, and we anticipate top line results at the end of Q2 2019. 
 
In March 2018 we initiated the IMPALA-X study. This open-label extension study allows patients who are rolling off IMPALA to continue treatment for up to three additional years and will determine the long-term safety and utilization of Molgradex in patients with aPAP. Active enrollment in this study continues.
 
Completed Phase 1 Clinical Study
 
In a Phase 1 study evaluating the safety and tolerability of Molgradex in 42 healthy adult volunteers, the drug was generally well tolerated and produced dose-dependent increases in total and differential white blood cell counts consistent with the known pharmacologic effect of GM-CSF. The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (“SAD”) and multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of Molgradex. As part of the SAD arm, 18 subjects were included with four subjects randomized to each of the three SAD dose levels (150 µg, 300 µg and 600 µg) and six subjects received placebo for a duration of six days. As part of the MAD arm, 24 subjects were included with nine subjects randomized to each of the two MAD dose levels (300 µg or 600 µg) and six subjects received placebo for a duration of six days.
 7

In the SAD arm, GM-CSF was absorbed into the systemic circulation with a time to reach peak serum concentration (“Tmax”) of two hours after inhalation of Molgradex; however, at picogram levels, 50 to 100 times lower than what has been observed following similar doses of IV-administered GM-CSF. Total systemic exposure (AUC last) increased with dose, ranging between 13 and 138 pg•h/mL and maximum concentration (“Cmax”) ranging between 9.1 and 41 pg/mL (Cmax was similar for the 300 and 600 µg dose levels). In the MAD arm, there was evidence of some accumulation after multiple dosing; Cmax increased from 32 pg/mL on Day 1 to 90 pg/mL on Day 6 at the 300 µg dose level, and from 96 pg/mL on Day 1 to 251 pg/mL on Day 6 at the 600 µg dose level. Likewise, AUC last increased from 97 to 248 pg•h/mL from Days 1 to 6 for the 300 µg dose level and from 350 to 802 pg•h/mL for the 600 µg dose level. Minimum measurable plasma concentrations (“Cmin”) on Day 6 were 3.6 and 5.1 pg/mL measured at 8 and 12 hours, respectively for the 300 µg and 600 µg dose levels. In subjects treated with Molgradex, a slight increase in total white blood cell and differential counts (primarily within normal reference ranges) was observed in a dose-dependent manner, in-line with the known biological mode-of-action of GM-CSF.
 
No meaningful difference in the frequency or severity of adverse events was observed between Molgradex 300 µg and placebo. The most common adverse event was cough, reported in 21 out of 30 subjects (70%) receiving Molgradex and 8 out of 12 subjects (67%) receiving placebo, and there was no difference in the causality assessment between the treatment arms. A higher number of treatment-related adverse events were observed at the 600 µg dose compared to the 300 µg dose and placebo in the MAD arm. There were no serious or severe adverse events, dose-limiting toxicity or other remarkable findings of clinical concern in the safety data.
 
Background on NTM
 
NTM lung infection is a rare and serious lung disorder associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Nontuberculous mycobacteria are naturally occurring organisms and NTM lung infection can occur when an individual inhales the organism from their environment and develops a slowly progressive and destructive lung disease. NTM lung infection is typically characterized by cough, fatigue, and weight loss. NTM infections often become chronic and require long courses of multiple antibiotics, and despite aggressive treatment regimens, treatment failure rates are high, and recurrence of infection common. Chronic NTM lung infection can have a significant impact on quality of life. There are up to 80,000 individuals affected in the U.S, and the most common types of NTM lung infection involve MAC and MABSC. There have been few advancements in new systemic treatments for NTM lung infection. However, in a 2017 Phase 3 clinical study, local delivery of an inhaled form of amikacin directly to the lung was shown to be effective in approximately one third of treatment refractory patients with pulmonary MAC infection. This suggests that administration of high local concentrations of drug directly at the site of infection provides an attractive new avenue to improve clinical outcomes in this and other difficult-to-treat chronic lung infections. 
 NTM lung infections are a considerable therapeutic challenge due to the unique ability of these bacteria to evade the normal killing mechanisms of alveolar macrophages, a type of immune cells responsible for killing bacteria in the lungs. There is increasing scientific literature suggesting that GM-CSF plays an important role in enhancing the ability of macrophages to clear mycobacteria.8 For instance, GM-CSF knock out mice inoculated with MABSC develop a chronic lung disease resembling human chronic infection, whereas wild type mice with intact GM-CSF production typically clear the bacteria quickly and fail to develop chronic infection. In animal studies, GM-CSF has been shown to kill NTM with similar efficacy compared to commonly used NTM antibiotics, and the simultaneous use of GM-CSF with antibiotics can further improve the antibacterial effect of either GM-CSF or antibiotics given alone. 
 In two published clinical case reports in the European Respiratory Journal by Dr. Wylam of the Mayo Clinic,9 inhaled GM-CSF was shown to eradicate or dramatically reduce the bacterial burden in patients with refractory MABSC lung infection. This suggests that the promising animal data may be translatable to humans, and the potential therapeutic role of GM-CSF in NTM lung infection warrants more intensive investigation. Among the various NTM species, MABSC is a particularly challenging clinical problem, as it is one of the most resistant organisms to antibiotics. Importantly, GM-CSF is not an antibiotic that targets the bacteria. Rather, it is an anti-infective immunotherapy that targets the human immune response, not the bacteria directly, thus avoiding the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance.
 Clinical Development of Molgradex ‒ NTM
 
A Phase 2a multi-center clinical study in non-CF patients, called OPTIMA, was initiated in Q1 2018 and is investigating the efficacy of Molgradex on reduction of NTM bacterial load in sputum, NTM sputum culture conversion to negative, exercise capacity, patient reported outcomes and safety.

OPTIMA is an open-label, non-controlled, multi-center, Phase 2a clinical study of Molgradex in 32 subjects (≥18 years of age) with persistent NTM lung infection. OPTIMA enrolled subjects with chronic MAC or MABSC infection, with all patients having either antibiotic refractory infection or intolerance to standard NTM antibiotics. The study initially consisted of a 24-week treatment period and a 12-week follow up period. Two groups of subjects were recruited into the OPTIMA study. Group 1 consists of patients who remained sputum culture positive while currently on a multidrug NTM guideline-based anti-mycobacterial regimen, which had been ongoing for at least six-months prior to the baseline visit. Group 2 consists of patients who remained sputum culture positive, but either stopped a multidrug NTM guideline-based anti-mycobacterial regimen at least 28 days prior to screening due to lack of response or intolerance, or never started such treatment.
 
The primary endpoint in the study is sputum culture conversion, defined as at least three consecutive sputum samples without growth of NTM. Secondary endpoints include: (i) the number of patients with sputum smear conversion to negative, defined as at least three consecutive negative acid-fast bacilli (“AFB”) stained sputum smears on microscopy among patients who were smear positive at baseline, (ii) the number of patients with durable sputum culture conversion, defined as sputum culture conversion at or before week 48 and culture still negative for growth of NTM at 12-week follow up, (iii) the number of patients with durable sputum smear conversion, defined as sputum smear conversion at or before week 48 and AFB stained smear still negative for NTM at 12-week follow up among patients who were smear positive at baseline, and (iv) other microbiological indicators, exercise capacities and patient reported outcomes.
 
Interim results from the OPTIMA study were disclosed in December 2018. 
 
The interim analysis focused on efficacy, as assessed by microbiological results, in 14 patients who completed the 24-week treatment period and had culture results available up to at least the 16-week timepoint. Ten of the evaluable patients have MAC infection and four have MABSC infection. Of the patients with MAC infection, eight are in treatment Group 1 (on anti-mycobacterial treatment) and two are in treatment Group 2 (not on anti-mycobacterial treatment). The four evaluable MABSC patients are evenly split between both treatment groups. Safety and tolerability was assessed for all 32 patients enrolled in the study. 
 
The data show that among the 10 patients with MAC infection, four experienced a consistent sputum smear conversion to negative by week 24, and three experienced a negative sputum culture at weeks 16 and 20, with culture results pending for the week 24 timepoint. Sputum smear or sputum culture conversions were not observed in the four patients with MABSC infection. Due to the generally slow growth of NTM on culture media, a sputum sample can be determined negative only after eight weeks of observation, causing a corresponding lag time in the assessment of the culture data.
 
Safety was assessed in the total study population. Among the 32 patients, six (19%) experienced serious adverse events (“SAEs”), including one patient who died by suicide. The death was considered unrelated to treatment. The majority of SAEs consisted of hospitalizations due to pulmonary exacerbations or worsening of NTM infection, of which one was considered possibly treatment-related. GM-CSF was generally well tolerated, with nine patients (28%) reporting mostly mild, potentially treatment-related respiratory adverse events. Respiratory adverse events were defined as shortness of breath, chest tightness or wheeze. A total of three patients (9%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events.
 
Consistent with the systemic pharmacological effect of GM-CSF on white blood cells, 17 patients (53%) experienced increased levels of blood eosinophils. The increase generally peaked at the week 4 timepoint, and levels decreased or plateaued at subsequent visits.
 
Based on the microbiological data and safety profile, which provides the basis to continue treating patients for a longer period of time, the duration of the OPTIMA study was extended from 24 to 48 weeks, with a 12-week follow up period at the end of treatment. This increases the ability to observe a more robust anti-infective effect, including culture conversions. The primary endpoint is sputum culture conversion during the treatment period, defined as at least three consecutive negative sputum samples. Final results from the study are expected in the first quarter of 2020.
 
In Q3 2018, the IND application for Molgradex in CF-affected patients with chronic NTM lung infection was accepted by the FDA. A Phase 2a study of Molgradex in CF-affected individuals with NTM lung infection is expected to initiate in Q1 2019.

Overview of AeroVanc
 
Background on MRSA Infection in CF
 
CF is a genetic disease characterized, in part, by the prevalence of thick, sticky mucus produced in the lung, frequent lung infections, and a resultant decline in pulmonary function. As the disease progresses, patients’ lungs are typically infected with bacteria that are difficult to eradicate. Inhaled antibiotics have become a cornerstone for the treatment of the most common chronic pathogen, Pseudomonas, in order to control the infection and improve lung function and quality of life. In recent years, MRSA lung infection has become increasingly common in CF, with a prevalence of 26% according to the most recent (2017) data report of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Importantly, persistent MRSA lung infection has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in CF, including a more rapid rate of decline in lung function10 and a shorter life expectancy.11 The increasing prevalence and high clinical impact of MRSA infection in CF have resulted in an unmet need for improved therapies to help address the condition. Considering the established practice of treating chronic Pseudomonas infection in CF using inhaled antibiotics, all of which have limited activity against MRSA, it would be logical to attempt treatment of chronic MRSA infection with an inhaled antibiotic that is active against MRSA. We believe that AeroVanc is the first inhaled antibiotic being developed to specifically treat MRSA infection of the lungs.
 
Current MRSA treatment options in CF
 Persistent MRSA lung infection in people living with CF is difficult to eradicate or manage using oral or IV antibiotics. Currently, there is no standard of care to manage the infection despite the high need.12 In contrast to the established treatment of Pseudomonas infection with inhaled antibiotics, there is no FDA-approved inhaled antibiotic treatment available for MRSA infection.
 
For people living with CF who have MRSA infection, IV vancomycin or linezolid are the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbation, and these drugs may be used in combination with other IV antibiotics in patients with simultaneous Gram-negative infections, such as Pseudomonas. For MRSA lung infection, vancomycin is available exclusively in IV form, and while highly effective against MRSA and other Gram-positive bacteria, chronic home-based use of IV vancomycin is not practical, and chronic use has also been associated with systemic toxicity, especially renal toxicity and ototoxicity.
 
According to our research, there is increasing clinical need to treat chronic MRSA infection in CF. In the absence of an inhaled antibiotic, there is emerging use of oral anti-MRSA antibiotics in an attempt to suppress the MRSA infection and reduce the occurrence of acute pulmonary exacerbations. According to our survey results, 27% of the surveyed CF specialists in the U.S. regularly use antibiotics targeting MRSA as a suppressive treatment (any dosage form) in patients with frequent exacerbations or other symptoms for which MRSA is considered a cause or contributing factor. This practice is emerging despite the absence of established consensus or guidelines relating to the use of oral anti-MRSA antibiotics in CF, or evidence of efficacy established in controlled studies.
 
As with current inhaled anti-pseudomonal drugs, we believe that there is significant clinical advantage in delivering an anti-MRSA antibiotic, such as vancomycin, directly to the site of infection to maximize the clinical efficacy, reduce systemic exposure and the risk of adverse effects, and to enable convenient use of the product outside of the hospital setting. The aerosolized IV form of vancomycin, administered by nebulization, has been used in multiple small published clinical studies, mainly to treat ventilator-associated pneumonia in an intensive care setting. In these studies and case reports, nebulized vancomycin had good antibacterial efficacy and was generally well tolerated. According to our research, in recent years many of the leading CF centers in the U.S. have explored the use of inhaled vancomycin to treat MRSA on a chronic basis, by nebulizing the IV form of vancomycin. The experience gained from this type of treatment has been encouraging and provides anecdotal reports of the safety and clinical utility of inhaled vancomycin for a period of several years in some patients. Similarly, in the 1990’s, nebulized IV tobramycin was explored as a treatment of Pseudomonas infections in people living with CF. This exploration resulted in the development of the most widely used inhaled antibiotic worldwide, and is a cornerstone of chronic treatment of Pseudomonas lung infection in CF.

We believe that inhaled antibiotics, as well as other palliative treatments, will continue to have a central role in the management of CF. Various disease modifying drugs, such as CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (“CFTR”) modulators, that attempt to address the underlying cause of CF, (i.e. restore or improve the function of the CFTR protein that is defective or dysfunctional in individuals living with CF) have recently been launched. Such disease-modifying drugs, on average, result in modest improvement in lung function and, potentially, slow the rate of lung function decline. Patients on these drugs continue to have chronic infections that require antibiotic treatment, and their lung function continues to decline.
 
AeroVanc Product Description
 
AeroVanc is a novel inhaled formulation of vancomycin being developed for the treatment of persistent MRSA lung infection in individuals with CF. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that was discovered in the mid-1950’s and is commonly used in the prophylaxis and treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Vancomycin acts by inhibiting proper cell wall synthesis of aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, and is generally not active against Gram-negative bacteria.
 AeroVanc is delivered via a capsule containing a proprietary dry powder formulation of vancomycin hydrochloride intended for oral inhalation with the AeroVanc inhaler. The AeroVanc inhaler is a commercialized, hand-held, manually operated, breath-activated device manufactured by Plastiape S.p.A. (Lecco, Italy).
 
We anticipate that AeroVanc will be used predominantly to suppress chronic MRSA lung infection, which has the potential to improve patients’ lung function and respiratory symptoms, and to prolong the time to pulmonary exacerbation and need of systemic antibiotics. AeroVanc is not intended to replace IV vancomycin or other IV antibiotics in the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations associated with MRSA. However, long-term AeroVanc use has the potential to reduce the occurrence of these exacerbations, and thereby reduce the need for IV treatments and hospitalizations.
 
If approved, we believe AeroVanc in CF will be broadly adopted based on a high level of interest for the product from direct clinician surveys, as well as market research of key opinion leaders in the field of CF. Notably, a clear majority of the surveyed CF physicians in the U.S. (94%) indicated they expect to prescribe AeroVanc for MRSA lung infection, if approved by the FDA. Likewise, according to U.S. payer interviews, an AeroVanc launch would receive reimbursement support given the high unmet need in an orphan indication and a current lack of comparable products.
 
AeroVanc Key Advantages 
 
There are a number of important characteristics that, we believe, contribute to AeroVanc’s overall clinical profile and may facilitate regulatory approval and, potentially, successful commercialization. Specifically, AeroVanc offers:

• | Strong product foundation, applying both a previously approved active drug substance and drug delivery technology.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High concentration of antibiotic delivered directly to the lungs (the primary site of infection) which, we believe, can result in higher clinical efficacy and reduced systemic toxicity, as compared with oral or IV delivery of antibiotics.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capsule based powder inhaler providing a fast and convenient method of administration, which is attractive to the CF population, who have a high treatment burden.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Eligibility for strong market protection via orphan drug status, QIDP status, a formulation patent, and an exclusive device supply agreement.

Clinical Development of AeroVanc
 
Phase 3
 
AeroVanc is currently being investigated in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study in the U.S. and Canada, called AVAIL, for the treatment of persistent MRSA lung infection in people living with CF. The study began enrolling patients at U.S. and Canadian clinical sites in September 2017 and December 2017, respectively. 
 
AVAIL is currently enrolling approximately 200 patients (150 patients ≤ 21 years old, 50 patients > 21 years old). During Period 1 of the study, patients are randomly assigned in a blinded 1:1 fashion to receive either AeroVanc (30 mg) twice daily, or placebo, by inhalation for 24 weeks or 3 dosing cycles. A dosing cycle is defined as 28 days of treatment followed by 28 days of observation. During Period 2 of the study, patients receive open-label AeroVanc (30 mg) twice daily for an additional 24 weeks or 3 dosing cycles, to evaluate the long-term safety of AeroVanc. 
 
11

The primary endpoint is the mean absolute change in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline, which will be analyzed sequentially at week 4 (the end of Cycle 1), week 12 (the end of Cycle 2), and at week 20 (the end of Cycle 3). Analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on patients 6 ‒ 21 years of age. Secondary endpoints include: (i) time-to-use of another antibiotic medication (oral, IV, and/or inhaled) for pulmonary infection, (ii) the number of successful FEV1-response cycles a patient achieves over Period 1 (weeks 4, 12, and 20), (iii) relative change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted at weeks 4, 12, and 20, (iv) change from baseline Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised scores at weeks 4, 12, and 20 and (v) change from baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Symptom Diary-Chronic Respiratory Symptom Score scores at weeks 4, 12, and 20. 
 
We anticipate that AVAIL patient enrollment will be completed in Q3 2019 with top line results expected in Q2 2020.
 
Completed Clinical Studies
 
Phase 1 Study
 
In a Phase 1 single escalating dose study, AeroVanc was shown to be generally well tolerated and safe, with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. In the study, AeroVanc inhalation powder was administered to 18 healthy volunteers (doses of 16 mg, 32 mg, and 80 mg), and seven patients with CF (doses of 32 mg and 80 mg). AeroVanc demonstrated a relatively slow pulmonary absorption phase (Tmax of 1.33 h - 2.08 h), followed by distribution and elimination comparable to IV administration. The mean absolute bioavailability across all AeroVanc doses was 49% (standard deviation 8%), with no apparent differences observed between the doses. The absolute bioavailability closely corresponds with the pulmonary absorption of vancomycin, considering that vancomycin is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The mean Cmax of AeroVanc after an 80 mg dose was 618 ng/mL, corresponding to approximately one fifth of the dose adjusted Cmax after a 250 mg dose of IV vancomycin. The dose linearity of AeroVanc, in terms of Cmax and AUC values, was excellent (R 2 > 0.99). In the CF patients, all subjects had sputum vancomycin concentrations in high excess of the minimum inhibitory concentration (“MIC”) of vancomycin for MRSA (2 µg/mL) at one hour after the administration of AeroVanc with both the 32 mg and the 80 mg dose (mean of 106 µg/mL and 261 µg/mL, respectively). At later time points, the concentrations decreased, but on average remained above the MIC values for up to 24 hours. Variability in sputum concentrations was high, as expected.
 
All adverse events in the healthy volunteers were classified as mild, and all events that were considered probably drug-related involved local irritation effects and resolved spontaneously and rapidly (between 15 and 60 minutes). Small reduction in the post-dose FEV1 (7% ‒ 11%) was observed in three subjects after the 80 mg dose. None of the subjects required bronchodilator treatment, and the changes were considered by the independent Drug Safety Monitoring Board to be clinically non-significant. In CF patients, chest congestion and/or chest tightness were reported by four of the seven patients, and there appeared to be a slight trend towards more adverse events at the higher dose (80 mg). All reported respiratory adverse events were mild, none of the patients felt distressed, and the events either did not require treatment or resolved after airway clearance and/or albuterol inhalation. Based on the sputum concentration data, dose levels of 32 mg and 64 mg twice a day were selected for use in the Phase 2 study.
 
Phase 2 Study
 
In a Phase 2 clinical study in CF patients with persistent MRSA lung infection, AeroVanc met a primary endpoint to reduce MRSA density in sputum, and showed encouraging trends of improvement in lung function, prolongation of the time to use of other antibiotics, and improvement in respiratory symptoms, with best responses in patients below 21 years of age. The consistency of the responses across the different endpoints, as well as the magnitude of change in the younger patients, supported the advancement of the AeroVanc drug candidate into a Phase 3 clinical study. The results of the Phase 2 study were summarized and presented to the FDA in an End of Phase 2 Meeting, and the agency subsequently provided detailed guidance on the design and analysis of our current Phase 3 study, which is described above under the heading “Phase 3.” The key findings of the Phase 2 study are described below.
 
The Phase 2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of AeroVanc in CF patients with persistently positive MRSA lung infection. The 28-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 87 patients. AeroVanc was administered at dose level of 32 mg twice daily (“BID”) or 64 mg BID, with an eight-week follow-up. The study was conducted at 40 sites in the U.S. Quantitative MRSA cultures from spontaneously expectorated sputum samples were used as the primary endpoint of the study. The average baseline values in both active drug cohorts, as well as the placebo cohorts were high, ranging from 6.78 ‒ 7.65 log 10 colony-forming units (“CFU”) /mL. In the primary endpoint analyses (modified intent-to-treat population), a reduction from baseline in MRSA CFU was observed in the 32 mg and 64 mg dose cohorts pooled, compared to placebo by -0.52 log 10 CFU/mL and -0.06 log 10 CFU/mL for the AeroVanc and placebo doses, respectively (p = 0.0312); in the 64 mg dose cohort by -0.63 log 10 CFU/mL and 0.16 log 10 CFU/mL for the AeroVanc and placebo doses, respectively (p = 0.0145); in the 32 mg dose cohort by -0.25 log 10 CFU/mL and -0.30 log 10 CFU/mL for the AeroVanc and placebo doses, respectively (p = 0.8352).

MICs of vancomycin for MRSA cultured from the sputum samples were determined using a broth microdilution technique at baseline, at each visit during the administration of AeroVanc, as well as at the post-administration follow-up time points. The distribution of MIC values was very narrow, with the MIC 50 and MIC 90 both at 0.5 µg/mL at baseline. At baseline, all strains were susceptible to vancomycin, with MIC values of 1 µg/mL, and there were no notable changes in the MIC distribution at any of the time points following the baseline sample. This suggests the susceptibility of MRSA to vancomycin was not affected by the 28 days of pulmonary administration of AeroVanc.
 
Vancomycin peak and trough concentrations in sputum at Day 8 and Day 29 were in high excess over the generally accepted level of MIC (mean C trough /MIC ratio > 35) after multiple dosing in all patients at both dose levels, with apparent dose-dependency, but no notable difference in C trough between the two time points.
 
The most frequent adverse events reported were respiratory related. The AeroVanc 32 mg BID dose was well tolerated, with no significant difference in adverse events as compared with placebo. However, a higher incidence of adverse events, most frequently consistent with signs and symptoms of bronchoconstriction, and a significantly higher rate of premature study drug discontinuations were seen in adult patients at the 64 mg BID dose, as compared with patients receiving the 32 mg of AeroVanc or placebo. Discontinuations were most commonly due to drug intolerability (mainly bronchoconstriction and/or chest tightness) or pulmonary exacerbation, and typically occurred within the first two weeks from the start of drug administration.
 
Based on the observed clinical results in the 32 mg cohort of patients below 21 years of age, the high vancomycin concentrations in sputum observed at both dose levels, and the high frequency of discontinuation in adult patients at the 64 mg dose, the Phase 3 study is further evaluating the 32 mg dose, and enrollment is focused on patients below 21 years of age. 
 
Human Factor Study
 
We have performed a human factor study with fourteen people living with CF (ages 12 ‒ 56 years old) to better understand patient reactions to the AeroVanc inhaler device, drug capsule and written instructions. Study participants represented a variety of sex and ethnicity demographics, as well as dominant hand preference. Patients were given the device, capsules and instructions to simulate use (without drug) and provide feedback. In summary, all patients were able to use the device properly and no device design issues were identified that could impact proper use.
Manufacturing and Supply
 
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities to produce clinical or commercial quantities of any of our product candidates. We have fee-for-service contracts with well-established drug substance manufacturers, as well as drug product manufacturers covering all steps of the manufacturing process of our product candidates. We expect to continue with this outsourcing model for the foreseeable future. All of our manufacturing and supply vendors conduct their operations under current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), a regulatory standard for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.
Molgradex Manufacturing
 
The drug substance in Molgradex, molgramostim, is currently manufactured by GEMA Biotech S.A. (Buenos Aires, Argentina). All clinical and nonclinical studies to date have used material sourced from GEMA Biotech S.A. and validation activities are ongoing to prepare for commercial manufacturing.  
 
The drug product, Molgradex, has been manufactured at Miltenyi Biotec GmbH (Berglisch Gladbach, Germany). Patheon UK Limited (Ferentino, Italy), a division of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., has been selected as the commercial drug product manufacturer. Technology transfer is ongoing, and the planning of process validation activities has been initiated. 
 
Molgradex is administered to the lungs using the investigational eFlow® Nebulizer System, manufactured by PARI Pharma GmbH (Stamberg, Germany). The eFlow nebulizer has been CE certified (CE 0123) according to the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC (as amended by Directive 2007/47/EC) as a class IIa device. The device has a 510(k) approval in the U.S. as a general device. We have an exclusive license and a long-term supply agreement with PARI Pharma GmbH, as further discussed below, covering the eFlow nebulizer for the administration of recombinant human GM-CSF.

AeroVanc Manufacturing
 
AeroVanc is a high-performance inhalation powder formulation of vancomycin hydrochloride, applying a commercially-available capsule inhaler. The drug substance used in AeroVanc, vancomycin hydrochloride USP, is produced using microbial fermentation followed by purification, and is sourced from Xellia Pharmaceuticals ApS (Copenhagen, Denmark), a commercial manufacturer with two manufacturing facilities (one in China and one in Denmark). Both sites use the same cell line and manufacturing processes and produce material of comparable quality. A long-term commercial supply agreement has been established with Xellia Pharmaceuticals ApS.
 
AeroVanc inhalation powder is a spray-dried powder containing a ratio of 9:1 by weight of vancomycin hydrochloride and l-leucine. L-leucine is an essential amino acid and has generally regarded as safe, GRAS, status as a food additive. Formulation studies showed that the addition of l-leucine improves inhalation performance in vitro, as measured by improved emitted dose and fine particle dose. The powder manufacturing is carried out by Hovione LLC (East Windsor, NJ), a vendor with two operational sites (one in the U.S. and one in Europe). Both of the facilities have the same base equipment, which could be upgraded to produce material of comparable quality. The proprietary AeroVanc spray drying process creates very fine particles (smaller than five microns) required for efficient delivery to the lungs. Proprietary nozzle and cyclone technologies were developed to meet product performance and manufacturing throughput requirements. The powder production process has been successfully scaled-up from laboratory to commercial equipment. A long-term commercial supply agreement is under negotiation with Hovione LLC.
 
The drug product is manufactured from bulk AeroVanc powder by GlaxoSmithKline Trading Services Limited (“GSK”). At this final stage of manufacturing, AeroVanc powder is conditioned and automatically filled into 16 mg capsules of vancomycin. The capsules are then packaged into aluminum foil blisters to protect them from light and moisture. A long-term commercial supply agreement has been established with GSK for the finished product.
 
The inhaler device used for AeroVanc is manufactured by Plastiape S.p.A. (Lecco, Italy). The device was approved in the U.S. as part of the Aridol ® new drug application (NDA 022368) on October 5, 2010. A cosmetically modified version of the device was approved in the U.S. as part of the Arcapta ® Neohaler ® new drug application (NDA 022383) on July 1, 2011. An exclusive long-term commercial supply agreement has been established with Plastiape S.p.A.
 
We have worked with our manufacturing partners to scale up processes, improve yields and production rates, and transfer processes to commercial facilities with commercial equipment. We have produced the supplies for the AVAIL pivotal Phase 3 clinical study using the same manufacturing sites, equipment and processes that will be used for commercial supply.
 Commercialization
 We own exclusive rights to Molgradex and AeroVanc in the U.S., and all other major markets, except for Japan, where we have licensed the Molgradex rights to Nobelpharma Co., Ltd. (“Nobelpharma”), located in Tokyo, Japan, and which is described further below. We plan to pursue regulatory approvals for our products in the U.S. and EU, and to independently commercialize AeroVanc and Molgradex in the U.S. In doing so, we may engage with strategic partners to help implement optimal sales and promotion activities. Our commercialization strategy will target key prescribing physicians, as well as provide patients with support programs to ensure product access. Pending EMA approval, we expect to commercialize Molgradex and AeroVanc in certain key markets in the EU and may engage with strategic partners to optimize sales and promotion activities in the remaining EU territories.
License and Supply Agreements

PARI Pharma GmbH
 In November 2014, Serendex, predecessor-in-interest to our Savara ApS subsidiary, entered into a license and collaboration agreement related to Molgradex with PARI Pharma GmbH (“PARI”), (collectively the “PARI License Agreement”), which we assumed as part of the Serendex Acquisition (refer to Item 7 of this report). Under the PARI License Agreement, we have a worldwide, exclusive license to commercialize PARI’s investigational eFlow Nebulizer device for the pulmonary delivery of any liquid formulation containing Human Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factors (“hGM-CSF”) as the sole active pharmaceutical ingredient for nebulization for aPAP. Additionally, we have the option to change the device, subject to certain conditions, to PARI’s eFlow Technology Nebulizer CS and, until marketing approval, the option to negotiate an extension to the license to cover commercialization of the drug for pulmonary delivery via the PARI eFlow Inline device for the treatment of certain other indications. 
 On July 23, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “PARI Amendment”), effective May 23, 2018, to the PARI License Agreement which adds NTM lung infection to the indications included in the license and allows us to add other pulmonary infections to the included indications in the future.
 Under the terms of the PARI License Agreement, we are not permitted to work with third parties to develop any inhalation device or nebulizer for the pulmonary delivery of a pharmaceutical product containing hGM-CSF as the sole active ingredient. This restriction extends until (i) in the European Economic Area, marketing approval of the product in Europe or the U.S., whichever is later, or (ii) in the rest of the world, the term of the PARI License Agreement.
 In consideration of rights granted by PARI, Serendex paid a one-time upfront fee and agreed to pay an hourly rate for work performed by PARI under work orders issued pursuant to the PARI License Agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to make future milestone payments to PARI based upon (i) the successful completion of certain clinical trials, (ii) submissions for regulatory approval in the U.S, the European Union or Japan, and (iii) the first marketing approval for the product in the U.S., the European Union or Japan. The PARI Amendment expanded the development milestones in the agreement to include NTM and any additional pulmonary indications.
 If we successfully commercialize any product candidate subject to the PARI License Agreement in a country, we are responsible for royalty payments equal to a percentage of net sales. We are obligated to make such royalty payments until the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim in an issued patent covering a portion of the PARI device in the applicable country or (ii) 15 years after the first commercial sale of Molgradex with the PARI device in that country (the “PARI Royalty Period”). If there is no such valid patent claim covering the applicable PARI device, the royalty owed to PARI will be decreased by a specified percentage.
 The license term extends on a country by country basis until the end of the PARI Royalty Period or until mutually agreed by the parties.
 In April 2015, Serendex entered into a commercial supply agreement with PARI (the “PARI Supply Agreement”) related to the supply of the investigational PARI eFlow Technology Nebulizer and related accessories for commercial use with our products after marketing approval is obtained. We assumed the PARI Supply Agreement as part of the Serendex Acquisition (as described in the subheading “Acquisition of Serendex Pharmaceuticals” in Item 7 of this report). Pursuant to the terms of the PARI Supply Agreement, we are obligated to purchase from PARI (i) within the European Economic Area, (a) during the first five years from marketing approval, all of our requirements for the device and related accessories and (b) thereafter 80% and (ii) in the rest of the world, all of our requirements during the PARI Royalty Period. Pricing is on a per unit basis, with a reduction in price once purchasing volumes reach over 5,000 for devices and starter kits and over 40,000 for nebulizer handsets in a twelve-month period.
 GEMA Biotech S.A.
 In December 2012, Serendex entered into a supply and license agreement related to supplying the API for Molgradex with GEMA Biotech S.A. (“GEMA”), which was subsequently amended by addendums in February 2016 and September 2017 (the “GEMA Agreement”). We assumed the GEMA Agreement as part of the Serendex Acquisition (as described in the subheading “Acquisition of Serendex Pharmaceuticals” in Item 7 of this report). Under the GEMA Agreement, we have an exclusive license to market, distribute and sell products based on GEMA recombinant hGM-CSF for any disease to be treated by inhalation, local pulmonary administration, parenteral administration, or local administration of the API in any territory except Latin America, Central America and Mexico. Under the original GEMA Agreement, GEMA is the sole supplier of the API.
 As consideration for the rights granted by GEMA, we are required to pay GEMA an agreed upon price per vial of 1 gram of the API. Additionally, if we successfully develop, register and obtain approval by the proper health authorities, we must pay GEMA a single digit percentage royalty on annual net sales. There is no minimum royalty, and no signing fee or milestones are included in the royalty payments. Additionally, we have milestone-based commitments to GEMA in the amount of $600,000 upon the successful release of the first GMP grade API batch and $2,000,000 upon the first regulatory approval of Molgradex in Europe or the U.S.  
 15

Pursuant to the terms of the February 2016 addendum, GEMA granted an exclusive worldwide license to Serendex to transfer the manufacture of the API to Synco Bio Partners B.V., and agreed to transfer the master cell bank and working cell bank to Serendex (now us) at our discretion. Upon the completion of the transfer of the master cell bank and working cell bank, the royalty payable to GEMA described above decreases.
 Nobelpharma Co., Ltd.
 
Serendex entered into a license agreement on May 12, 2016, as assumed by us in the Serendex Acquisition, which was amended on June 4, 2018 (the “Nobelpharma Agreement”), with Nobelpharma Co. Ltd. (“Nobelpharma”) under which Nobelpharma received an exclusive right to import, market, sell, distribute and promote Molgradex in Japan for the treatment of aPAP. In return, Nobelpharma will pay us marketing and regulatory-based milestone payments totaling $10.5 million and sales-based royalties equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of the National Health Insurance price determined by the Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare in Japan. 
 
Pursuant to the Nobelpharma Agreement, we are obligated to fund Nobelpharma fifty percent (50%), up to a maximum of approximately $0.8 million, of the external costs associated with specific regulatory and filing activities to be conducted by Nobelpharma regarding the commercialization of Molgradex for the treatment of aPAP in Japan.
 

Mayo Foundation for Medical Education Services and Research
 
Under an agreement with the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education Services and Research, entered into on October 8, 2018, we are subject to certain milestone payments for the use of proprietary information and material in specific intellectual property filings related to the application of Molgradex in the treatment of NTM. We will owe royalties to the foundation based on net sales of Molgradex for the treatment of NTM equal to one half of one percent (0.5%) when the intellectual property filings are published and one quarter of one percent (0.25%) prior to the publication or in the event publication does not occur, with respect to the specified intellectual property filings.
Government Regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of drugs, such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Government Regulation of Drugs
 The process required by the FDA before drug product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
  
• | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) regulation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or ethics committee for each clinical site before a clinical trial can begin.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed product candidate for its intended purpose.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA, after completion of all required clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 16

 
• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigational sites to assess compliance with current Good Clinical Practices (“cGCP”); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the U.S., which must be updated annually and when significant changes are made.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB, for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. Additionally, in certain instances, a fourth phase, post approval, may be necessary or required.
  
• | Phase 1. The drug product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. Phase 4 studies may be required as a condition to approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the drug characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 17

NDA Submission and Review by the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once an NDA has been filed, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for the indication being pursued, and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety and effectiveness. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. After the FDA evaluates an NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or our drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may request additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of its products under development.
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drug products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider sections of the NDA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A fast track designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the NDA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 18

Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve an NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Sponsors may request the FDA to designate a breakthrough therapy at the time of or any time after the submission of an IND, but ideally before an end-of-phase 2 meeting with the FDA. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller or more efficient clinical trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough designation also allows the sponsor to file sections of the NDA for review on a rolling basis. We may seek designation as a breakthrough therapy for some or all of our product candidates.
 Fast track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 The review and approval process with respect to our drug candidates may also be significantly delayed in the event of government shutdowns, if any.
 Orphan Drug Status
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drug candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the drug in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Although there may be some increased communication opportunities, orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
 Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of our drug candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.
 As in the U.S., designation as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU, must be made before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product.
 The FDA and foreign regulators expect holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the orphan drug.
 19

GAIN Act Exclusivity for Antibiotics
 In 2012, Congress passed legislation known as the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act (the “GAIN Act”). This legislation is designed to encourage the development of antibacterial and antifungal drug products that treat pathogens that cause serious and life-threatening infections. To that end, the new law grants an additional five years of exclusivity upon the approval of an NDA for a drug product designated by FDA as a QIDP. Thus, for a QIDP with Orphan Drug Designation, the periods of five-year exclusivity and seven-year orphan drug exclusivity, would become 12 years.
 A QIDP is defined in the GAIN Act to mean “an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by (1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens or (2) certain qualifying pathogens.” A “qualifying pathogen” is a pathogen that has the potential to pose a serious threat to public health (such as resistant Gram-positive pathogens, multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and C. difficile) and that is included in a list established and maintained by the FDA. A drug sponsor may request the FDA to designate its product as a QIDP any time before the submission of an NDA. The FDA must make a QIDP determination within 60 days of the designation request. A product designated as a QIDP will be granted priority review by the FDA and can qualify for “fast track” status.
 The five year exclusivity extension under the GAIN Act for drug products designated by the FDA as QIDPs does not apply to: a supplement to an application under FDCA Section 505(b) for any QIDP for which an extension is in effect or has expired; a subsequent application filed with respect to a product approved by the FDA for a change that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength; or a product that does not meet the definition of a QIDP under Section 505(g) based upon its approved uses.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may, among other things, halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the NDA.
 Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing.
 The FDA may withdraw approval of an NDA if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 20

 
• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Government Regulation of Combination Products
 Our products under development will be regulated as combination products, which means that they are comprised of two or more different components that, if marketed individually, would be subject to different regulatory paths and would require approval of independent marketing applications by the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a center within the FDA that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. We believe our product candidates include both a drug and medical device component, and will be regulated as a drug, subject to the review of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research which will have primary jurisdiction over premarket development and approval. The FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health will provide support and review of the inhaler component of our product candidates.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 Our sales, promotion, medical education, clinical research and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the U.S. in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs and interactions with healthcare professionals must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the civil False Claims Act (“FCA”), physician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, and additional federal and state laws similar to the foregoing.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the knowing and willing, direct or indirect offer, receipt, solicitation or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients, including the purchase, order or lease of any good, facility, item or service that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and services. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to increased scrutiny and review if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. The government has enforced the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham research or consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payers.

Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the FCA, impose liability on persons and/or entities that, among other things, knowingly present or cause to be presented claims that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed for payment or approval by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons or entities that “cause” the submission of claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, submitting claims for services not provided as claimed, or submitting claims for services that were provided but not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual, or whistleblower, in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other illegal sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, certain companies that were found to be in violation of the FCA have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, restricting the manner in which they conduct their business.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers; knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; and willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payer, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our products, once commercialized, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, for payments or other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Covered manufacturers are required to collect and report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data to the government each year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Additionally, entities that do not comply with mandatory reporting requirements may be subject to a corporate integrity agreement. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on covered manufacturers’ marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals.
 We are also subject to data privacy and security regulation by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business and the EU with the General Data Protection Regulation rules which became effective in May 2018. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements on certain health care providers, plans and clearinghouses (collectively, “covered entities”) and their “business associates,” relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain states have their own laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other and/or HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 22

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to them, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, and diminished profits and future earnings, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 In addition to the foregoing health care laws, we are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have adopted an anti-corruption policy which mandates compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws applicable to our business throughout the world. However, we cannot assure that such a policy or procedures implemented to enforce such a policy will protect against intentional, reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and reputation.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement are provided by third-party payers. Third-party payers include state and federal government health care programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payers will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, we cannot be certain of this. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price, examining the cost-effectiveness, and reducing reimbursement for medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective and thus may not be covered or sufficiently reimbursed. It is time consuming and expensive for third-party payers to seek coverage and reimbursement. Thus, one payer’s decision to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that another payer will provide coverage or that the reimbursement levels will be adequate. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow third-party payers to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
Healthcare Reform
 The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could materially affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 By way of example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to our potential drug candidates are:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 23

 
• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include, among others, the Budget Control Act of 2011, which mandates aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.
 We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, including the possible repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, are unpredictable, and the potential impact on our operations and financial position are uncertain, but may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and place additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the U.S. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including our product candidates and our processes. We seek patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for our products, their methods of use and processes of manufacture and any other technology to which we have rights, as appropriate, such as device exclusivity. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
 We own six issued patents and additional pending patent applications worldwide for a proprietary formulation of AeroVanc. The patents and pending applications are derived from a PCT application (Pub. No. WO2012159103) entitled “Dry Powder Vancomycin Compositions and Associated Methods.” In May 2017, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued United States Patent No. 9,572,774 for “Dry Powder Vancomycin Compositions and Associated Methods” which will provide key intellectual property protection in the U.S. for the AeroVanc program and will expire no earlier than 2032. This affords us important composition of matter protection for our AeroVanc program in the U.S., the largest market for the product, and is a key component of our market protection strategy which also includes Orphan Drug and QIDP protection. We have also received a Notice of Allowance from the Canadian Intellectual Property Office for our Canadian Patent Application No. 2,836,643 entitled “Dry Powder Vancomycin Compositions and Associated Methods.” This notice serves as official communication that the examination of the patent application has been successfully completed. Once issued, the patent will provide protection for AeroVanc in Canada until 2032. We also have corresponding patent applications for AeroVanc in different stages of prosecution in other key markets throughout the world. As of March 12, 2019, patents have issued in the U.S., Canada, Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore.
 While we do not have any issued patents or pending applications covering Molgradex or its use in aPAP, we have issued patents ex-US (under prosecution in the U.S.) with an additional international patent application pending for Molgradex for the treatment of NTM lung infection. Molgradex is also a registered trademark in most European countries.
 Our success will, in part, depend on the ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, the validity and enforceability of our patents, the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets as well as our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 24

We cannot be sure patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology and products. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our processes and proprietary technology portfolio are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect the proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. While we have confidence in our key individuals, consultants, partner organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and there may not be adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to continuous technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. We believe that key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates will be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. Many of our potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than us, and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, manufacturing, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be faster and more successful in obtaining FDA approval for therapies and achieving widespread market acceptance. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of very capable competitors. We anticipate facing intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Our competitors’ products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our therapies obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover development and commercialization expenses.
 We are not aware of any other companies developing an inhaled form of GM-CSF. A glycosylated GM-CSF product, sargramostim (Leukine), is available on the market in the U.S., intended for IV or subcutaneous delivery in patients with neutropenia following cancer chemotherapy. Leukine has not been approved for the treatment of aPAP or any other acute or chronic lung disease but may be administered off-label. The drug substance in Leukine, sargramostim, has been used in a nonclinical research project conducted by NIH/TRND in collaboration with the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine on the potential application of inhaled GM-CSF as a treatment for aPAP. No clinical studies have been conducted to date under this collaboration project. We are aware of a multicenter clinical study of inhaled Leukine, using a standard commercially available nebulizer, which is currently ongoing in Japan, conducted by a consortium of independent clinical investigators. It is not known to us if this study, together with other possibly available related clinical or nonclinical information, may be, or will be, used to support a potential new product approval in Japan. If such a new product would be approved and launched in Japan, we believe it has the potential to present a material competitive threat to the commercial success of Molgradex in Japan. In addition, in November 2018, Partner Therapeutics, Inc., a commercial biotechnology company, was granted Orphan Drug Designation to Leukine® for the treatment of PAP by the FDA. 
 We are not aware of any other companies developing inhaled forms of vancomycin. There are several inhaled antibiotics on the market or in development, but we are not aware of any other inhaled antibiotic product that would be specifically developed for the treatment of MRSA infection. Certain inhaled antibiotics in development, including levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin inhalation formulations, may possess some level of in vitro or in vivo activity against MRSA, even though the compounds are not generally considered MRSA-antibiotics. It is therefore possible that such products, if approved, may present a competitive threat to AeroVanc. A combination product containing fosfomycin and tobramycin for inhalation (“FTI”) was developed by Gilead Sciences (Foster City, CA), and shown in a Phase 2 study to possess activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA. Gilead Sciences terminated the development of the product, and licensed it to CURx Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA) in February 2014. No clinical studies on FTI have been initiated by CURx Pharmaceuticals. If FTI is developed, and approved, for the treatment of MRSA lung infection in CF, we believe it has the potential to present a material competitive threat to the commercial success of AeroVanc.
 25

Many small and large pharmaceutical companies have intravenously or orally administered MRSA-antibiotics on the market, and/or in development. Whereas such antibiotics are important in the treatment of many acute and chronic MRSA-infections, such as skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, or endocarditis, we do not believe these products are practical or sufficiently efficacious and/or safe for long-term management of chronic MRSA lung infection in individuals living with CF. Therefore, we do not believe these products and product candidates are a material competitive threat to the commercial success of AeroVanc.
 
Employees
 As of March 13, 2019, we had 33 full-time employees and one part-time employee, as well as several full-time or part-time consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Acquisition of Serendex Pharmaceuticals
 On July 15, 2016, we closed on a Business Transaction Agreement (the “Serendex Acquisition”) under which we acquired certain assets, liabilities, employees, and subsidiaries of Serendex Pharmaceuticals A/S (“Serendex”), a public limited company organized under the laws of Denmark, which delisted from the Oslo Axxes on or about May 4, 2016. Serendex’s wholly-owned subsidiaries include Pharmaorigin ApS and Drugrecure ApS  which are private limited companies organized under the laws of Denmark. Serendex was a biopharmaceutical development company which, directly and through its subsidiaries, advanced a pipeline and portfolio of novel inhalation therapies and related technologies for the treatment of severe pulmonary conditions. Its primary focus was on the medicinal product Molgradex (an inhalation formulation of recombinant human GM-CSF for the treatment of aPAP). The purchase price consists of 1,965,400 shares of our common stock, taking into consideration the Exchange Ratio of the Merger (refer to Note 1 of the consolidated financial statement in this report), and $21.5 million of contingent cash consideration based upon the achievement of certain milestones.
Merger with Mast Therapeutics and Corporate Information
 On April 27, 2017, Savara completed its business combination with Mast Therapeutics, Inc. (“Mast”), a publicly held company, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the "Merger Agreement"), dated January 6, 2017 (the ‘Merger’). In connection with and immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, Mast implemented a reverse stock split at a ratio of one new share for every 70 shares of its common stock outstanding. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Savara common stock was then converted into Mast common stock at the Exchange Ratio (refer to Item 7 and note 1 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this report). As a result of the Merger, the Mast’s pre-existing equity holders owned approximately 23% of the combined company, and Savara’s pre-existing equity holders owned approximately 77%. In connection with the Merger, Mast changed its name to Savara Inc.  
 Savara was formed as a corporation in Delaware in 2007.  Mast was originally incorporated in Delaware in December 1995. In October 2000, Mast merged its wholly-owned subsidiary, Biokeys Acquisition Corp., with and into Biokeys, Inc. and changed its name to Biokeys Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In May 2003, Mast merged Biokeys, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, with and into the company and changed the company’s name to ADVENTRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In March 2013, the company merged Mast Therapeutics, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, with and into the company and changed the company’s name to Mast Therapeutics, Inc. In April 2017, Mast merged its wholly-owned subsidiary, Victoria Merger Corp., with and into Aravas Inc. (formerly, Savara Inc.) and changed the name of the company to Savara Inc.
