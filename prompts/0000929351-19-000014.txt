ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Overview
Lionsgate (NYSE: LGF.A, LGF.B) is a global content leader whose films, television series, digital products and linear and over-the-top platforms reach next generation audiences around the world. In addition to our filmed entertainment leadership, Lionsgate content drives a growing presence in interactive and location-based entertainment, video games, esports and other new entertainment technologies. Lionsgate's content initiatives are backed by a nearly 17,000-title film and television library and delivered through a global sales and licensing infrastructure.
We manage and report our operating results through three reportable business segments: Motion Picture, Television Production and Media Networks. Financial information for our segments is set forth in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report.
Motion Picture
Our Motion Picture segment includes revenues derived from the following:

• | Theatrical. Theatrical revenues are derived from the domestic theatrical release of motion pictures licensed to theatrical exhibitors on a picture-by-picture basis (distributed by us directly in the United States and through a sub-distributor in Canada).


• | Home Entertainment. Home Entertainment revenues are derived from the sale or rental of our film productions and acquired or licensed films and certain television programs (including theatrical and direct-to-video releases) on packaged media and through digital media platforms (including pay-per-view and video-on-demand platforms, electronic sell through, and digital rental). In addition, we have revenue sharing arrangements with certain digital media platforms which generally provide that, in exchange for a nominal or no upfront sales price, we share in the rental or sales revenues generated by the platform on a title-by-title basis.


• | Television. Television revenues are primarily derived from the licensing of our theatrical productions and acquired films to the linear pay, basic cable and free television markets.


• | International. International revenues are derived from (i) licensing of our productions, acquired films, our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles to international distributors, on a territory-by-territory basis, and (ii) the direct distribution of our productions, acquired films, and our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles in the United Kingdom.


• | Other. Other revenues are derived from, among others, the licensing of our film and television content to other ancillary markets, our interactive ventures and games division, our global live and location-based entertainment franchise division, and the sales and licensing of music from the theatrical exhibition of our films and the television broadcast of our productions.

Television Production
Our Television Production segment includes revenues derived from the following:

• | Television. Television revenues are derived from the licensing to domestic markets (e.g., linear pay, basic cable, free television and syndication) of scripted and unscripted series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming. Television revenues also include revenue from licenses to subscription-video-on-demand (“SVOD”) platforms in which the initial license of a television series is to an SVOD platform.


• | International. International revenues are derived from the licensing and syndication to international markets of scripted and unscripted series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming.


• | Home Entertainment. Home Entertainment revenues are derived from the sale or rental of television production movies or series on packaged media and through digital media platforms.

• | Other. Other revenues are derived from, among others, the licensing of our television programs to other ancillary markets, the sales and licensing of music from the television broadcasts of our productions, and from commissions due to our interest in 3 Arts Entertainment related to talent management.

Our Media Networks segment includes revenues derived from the following:

• | Starz Networks. Starz Networks’ revenues are derived from the domestic distribution of our STARZ branded premium subscription video services pursuant to affiliation agreements with U.S. multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), including cable operators, satellite television providers and telecommunications companies, and over-the top (“OTT”) (collectively, “Distributors”), and on a direct-to-consumer basis. Starz Networks' revenues also include international revenues from the OTT distribution of the Company's STARZ branded premium subscription video services.


• | STARZPLAY International. STARZPLAY International revenues are primarily derived from OTT distribution of the Company's STARZ branded premium subscription video services internationally.


• | Streaming Services. Streaming Services revenues are derived from the Lionsgate legacy start-up direct to consumer streaming services on SVOD platforms.

MOTION PICTURE
Motion Picture - Theatrical
Production and Acquisition
We take a disciplined approach to theatrical production, with the goal of producing content that can be distributed through various domestic and international platforms. In doing so, we attempt to mitigate the financial risk associated with production by, among other things:

• | Negotiating co-financing development and co-production agreements which may provide for joint efforts and cost-sharing with one or more third-party companies;


• | Pre-licensing international distribution rights on a selective basis, including through international output agreements (which license rights to distribute a film in one or more media generally for a limited term, and in one or more specific territories prior to completion of the film);


• | Structuring agreements that provide for talent participation in the financial success of the film in exchange for reduced guaranteed “up-front payments” that would be paid regardless of the film's success; and


• | Utilizing governmental incentives, programs and other structures from state and foreign countries (which typically take the form of sales tax refunds, transferable tax credits, refundable tax credits, low interest loans, direct subsidies or cash rebates, calculated based on the amount of money spent in the particular jurisdiction in connection with the production).

Our approach to acquiring films for theatrical release is similar to our approach to film production. We generally seek to limit our financial exposure in acquiring films while adding films of quality and commercial viability to our release schedule and library.
Distribution 
The economic life of a motion picture consists of its exploitation in theaters, on packaged media and on various digital and television platforms in territories around the world. 
We distribute motion pictures directly to movie theaters in the U.S. whereby the exhibitor retains a portion of the gross box office receipts and the balance is remitted to the distributor. Concurrent with their release in the U.S., films are generally released in Canada and may also be released in one or more other foreign markets. We construct release schedules taking into account moviegoer attendance patterns and competition from other studios' scheduled theatrical releases. We use either wide (generally, more than 2,000 screens nationwide) or limited initial releases, depending on the film. After the initial theatrical release, distributors seek to maximize revenues by releasing films in sequential release date windows, which may be exclusive against other non-theatrical distribution platforms.
Producing, marketing and distributing films can involve significant risks and costs, and can cause our financial results to vary depending on the timing of a film’s release. For instance, marketing costs are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows, and are expensed as incurred. Therefore, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film’s theatrical exhibition, and profitability for the film may not be realized until after its theatrical release window. Further, we may revise the release date of a film as the production schedule changes or in such a manner as we believe is likely to maximize revenues or for other business reasons. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any of the films scheduled for release will be completed, that completion will occur in accordance with the anticipated schedule or budget, or that the film will ever be released.
Theatrical Releases
In fiscal 2019 (i.e., the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2019), we released 33 films in the U.S. across all our labels, which included the following:

• | Fourteen films released through our Lionsgate and Summit Entertainment labels (including films developed and produced in-house, films co-developed and co-produced and films acquired from third parties);


• | Six films released through our Lionsgate Premiere label;


• | One film released through our Good Universe label;


• | Four films released through Pantelion Films, our joint venture with Grupo Televisa; and

Lionsgate and affiliated companies have distributed films that have earned 124 Academy Award® nominations and 30 wins, as well as numerous Golden Globe Awards®, Producers Guild Awards®, Screen Actors Guild Awards®, Directors Guild Awards®, BAFTA Awards and Independent Spirit Awards nominations and wins.
Motion Picture - Home Entertainment
Our U.S. home entertainment distribution operation exploits our film and television content library of nearly 17,000 motion picture titles and television episodes and programs, consisting of titles from, among others, Lionsgate, our subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures (such as Starz, Summit Entertainment, Anchor Bay Entertainment, Artisan Entertainment, Grindstone Entertainment Group, Modern Entertainment, Trimark, Pantelion Films and Roadside Attractions), as well as titles from third parties such as A24, A&E, Amazon Studios, AMC, CBS Films, Entertainment Studios, Marvel, Miramax, Saban Entertainment, StudioCanal, and Tyler Perry Studios. Home entertainment revenue consists of packaged media and digital revenue.
Packaged Media
Packaged media distribution involves the marketing, promotion and sale and/or lease of DVDs/Blu-ray discs to wholesalers and retailers who then sell or rent the DVDs/Blu-ray discs to consumers for private viewing. Fulfillment of physical distribution services are substantially licensed to Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment.
We distribute or sell content directly to retailers such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, Amazon, Costco and others who buy large volumes of our DVDs/Blu-ray discs to sell directly to consumers. Sales to Wal-Mart accounted for approximately 53% of net home entertainment packaged media revenue in fiscal 2019. We also directly distribute content to the rental market through Redbox, Netflix and others.
Of these titles, certain are released through our subsidiary, Grindstone Entertainment Group, which acquires and/or produces titles as finished pictures and as “pre-buys” based on script, cast and genres, and creates targeted key art, marketing materials and release plans, which are then distributed direct-to-video, VOD and through other media. In fiscal 2019, Grindstone Entertainment Group released 37 titles.
Additionally, we distribute television product including series such as American Gods, Ancient Aliens, Ash vs. Evil Dead, Blue Mountain State, Casual, Duck Dynasty, Fear the Walking Dead, Grace and Frankie, Graves, Narcos, Knightfall, MacGyver, Into the Badlands, Mad Men, Nurse Jackie, Orange Is The New Black, Power, The Royals, The Walking Dead, Weeds, library titles such as Alf and Little House on the Prairie, certain Disney-ABC Domestic Television series, as well as premier children's brands including Saban Brand’s Power Rangers, Aardman’s Shaun the Sheep library, and Rock Dog.
Our year included the following:

• | In fiscal 2019, one of our theatrical releases, I Can Only Imagine, debuted at number one on DVD/Blu-ray;


• | In fiscal 2019, we shipped approximately 65 million DVD/Blu-ray finished units;

8


• | In calendar 2018, we had an approximate 9% market share for home entertainment, making us the number six studio in market share overall;


• | In calendar 2018, we maintained a box office-to-home entertainment conversion rate of 22% above the industry average. Box office-to-home entertainment conversion rate is calculated as the ratio of the total of both first cycle DVD release revenues and total digital platform revenues for a theatrical release compared to the total North American box-office revenues from such theatrical release.

Digital Media
Digital media distribution involves delivering content (including certain titles not distributed theatrically or on physical media) by electronic means directly to consumers in-home and on mobile devices. The key distribution methods today include transactional distribution (such as electronic-sell-through (“EST”) and transactional video-on-demand (“TVOD”)), SVOD, advertiser-supported video-on-demand (“AVOD”) and free video-on-demand (“FVOD”)), as well as distribution through various linear pay, basic cable and free, over-the-air television platforms.
Digital transactional platforms and networks to which we distribute our content include, among others, iTunes, Amazon, Wal-Mart's Vudu, Google Play, Microsoft's Xbox, and Sony's PlayStation Network. Digital SVOD services to which we license our content include, among others, Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. AVOD services to which we license our content include, among others, The Roku Channel, Tubi TV, YouTube, IMDb, and Pluto. We also directly distribute digital transactional content to MVPDs including cable operators (such as Comcast and Charter), satellite television providers (such as DIRECTV and DISH Network) and telecommunications companies (such as Verizon).
Linear networks to which we distribute our content include, among others, pay television networks such as Starz, EPIX, HBO and Showtime, and basic cable networks such as USA Network, FX, Turner Entertainment Networks, BET, Pop, A&E, SyFy, Lifetime, MTV, Bravo, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, Audience Network, Spike, AMC Networks, Freeform, Reelz, Nickelodeon, El Rey, HD Net, Bounce, Telemundo and UniMás.
In fiscal 2019, we achieved the following:

• | Four titles we distributed, Tyler Perry’s Acrimony, Overboard, The Spy Who Dumped Me and Hunter Killer, debuted at the number one ranking on the Rentrak On-Demand charts.


• | Two titles we distributed, Hostiles and Chappaquiddick, debuted at the number two and number three rankings, respectively, on the Rentrak On-Demand charts.


• | Four of our titles reached the number one ranking on the iTunes’ movie charts, including Sicario, A Simple Favor, Hunter Killer and Robin Hood.

Motion Picture - Television

Motion Picture - International
Our international sales operations are headquartered at our offices in London, England. The primary components of our international business are, on a territory by territory basis through third parties or directly through our international divisions:

TELEVISION PRODUCTION
Our television business consists of the development, production, syndication and distribution of television programming. We principally generate revenue from the licensing and distribution of such programming to broadcast television networks, pay and basic cable networks, digital platforms and syndicators of first-run programming, which license programs on a station-by-station basis and pay in cash or via barter (i.e., trade of programming for airtime). Each of these platforms may acquire a mix of original and library programming.
After initial exhibition, we distribute programming to subsequent buyers, both domestically and internationally, including basic cable network, premium subscription services or digital platforms (known as “off-network syndicated programming”). Off-network syndicated programming can be sold in successive cycles of sales which may occur on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. In addition, television programming is sold on home entertainment (packaged media and via digital delivery) and across all other applicable ancillary revenue streams including music publishing, touring and integration.
As with film production, we use tax credits, subsidies, and other incentive programs for television production in order to maximize our returns and ensure fiscally responsible production models.

The linear networks air over 1,000 movies per month from studio partners, including first-run content from Sony Pictures Entertainment, and have a growing line-up of successful original programming. Our services are offered by Distributors to their subscribers either at a fixed monthly price as part of a programming tier or package or on an a la carte basis, or directly to consumers via the STARZ app at www.starz.com or through our retail partners (such as Apple and Google) for a monthly fee.
The table below depicts our 17 existing linear services, the respective on-demand service, the STARZ app service and highlights some of their key attributes.
Demographics and Strategy
Our services deliver Obsessable™ original series and hit movies that appeal to a wide range of audiences, attracting both die hard and casual viewers and serving a variety of fandoms. We are focused on developing and delivering content to meet the needs of engaged viewers, including underserved audiences such as African Americans, LatinX, LGBTQIA and female audiences.
Built to serve both our traditional MVPDs as well as the OTT community, the STARZ app is a best-in-class subscription video app designed with fans in mind. In addition to targeting MVPD subscribers, the STARZ app targets audiences who are looking for an alternative to a traditional subscription package. The primary audience for the app consists of a balanced mix of individuals, 
15

who are cost-conscious, heavy consumers of video content and likely have at least one OTT subscription service. Other important segments consist of households with children and frequent travelers looking for the ability to download and watch blockbuster theatricals, STARZ original series and favorite TV and movies without an internet connection.
We also intend to ensure that our Starz Networks’ services are available in formats and platforms that meet the needs of our Distributors as well as subscribers. We seek to monetize the digital rights we control for our Starz Networks’ exclusive original series and those under our programming licensing agreements with Hollywood studios by licensing the digital rights to Starz Networks’ services to our traditional distributors and online video providers as well as using these rights for the STARZ app.
We believe that this strategy, combined with a proven management team, positions Starz Networks for continued success. We look forward to making our Starz Networks services “must haves” for subscribers and a meaningful margin driver for our Distributors, thereby driving value for our stockholders.
Affiliation agreements
Our services are distributed pursuant to affiliation agreements with Distributors. These agreements require delivery of programming that meets certain standards. We earn revenue under these agreements either (i) based on the total number of subscribers who receive our services multiplied by rates specified in the affiliation agreements or (ii) based on amounts or rates which are not tied solely to the total number of subscribers who receive our services. Our affiliation agreements expire at various dates through 2023.
We work with Distributors to increase the number of subscribers to our services. To accomplish this, we may help fund the Distributors’ efforts to market these services or may permit Distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees. We believe these efforts enhance our relationship with Distributors, improve the awareness of our services and ultimately increase subscribers and revenue over the term of these affiliation agreements.
Distributors report the number of subscribers to our services and pay for services, generally, on a monthly basis. The agreements are generally structured to be multi-year agreements with staggered expiration dates and generally provide for annual contractual rate increases of a fixed percentage or a fixed amount, or rate increases tied to annual increases in the Consumer Price Index.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, revenue earned under Starz Networks’ affiliation agreements with AT&T (including DIRECTV) accounted for at least 10% of Lionsgate's revenue.
OTT service
The STARZ app is the single destination for both Distributor authenticated and direct OTT subscribers to stream or download our original series and movie content. The STARZ app:

• | Is available on a wide array of platforms and devices;


• | Includes on-demand streaming and downloadable access to our content in a single destination app;


• | Offers instant access to approximately 7,500 selections each month (including original series and commercial free movies);

Output and Content License Agreements
The majority of content on our services consists of movies that have been released theatrically. Starz has an exclusive long-term output licensing agreement with Sony for all qualifying movies released theatrically in the U.S. by studios owned by Sony through December 31, 2021. The Sony agreement, which began in 2001, includes all titles released under the Columbia, Screen Gems, Sony Pictures Classics and TriStar labels. Starz does not license movies produced by Sony Pictures Animation. Under this agreement, Starz has valuable exclusive rights to air new movies on linear television services, on-demand or online during two separate windows over a period of approximately three to seven years from their initial theatrical release. Generally, except on a VOD or pay-per-view basis, no other linear service, online streaming or other video service may air or stream these recent releases during Starz’s windows, and no other premium subscription service may air or stream these releases between the two windows.
Starz also licenses library content comprised of older, previously released theatrical movies from many of Hollywood’s major studios. In addition to theatrical movies, Starz licenses made for television movies, television series and other content from studios, production companies or other rights holders. The rights agreements for library content are of varying duration and generally permit Starz’s services to exhibit these movies, series and other programming during certain window periods.
A summary of significant output and library programming agreements (including a library agreement with Lionsgate) are as follows:
17


Significant output programming agreements | | Significant library programming agreements
Studio | Term (1) | | Studio | Term 
Sony . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 12/2021 | | Paramount . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 08/2022

(1) Dates based on initial theatrical release. | | | | 

The Sony output agreement requires Starz to pay for movies at rates calculated on a pricing grid that is based on each film’s domestic box office performance (subject to maximum amounts payable per movie and a cap on the number of movies that can be put to Starz each year). The amounts Starz pays for library content vary based on each specific agreement, but generally reflect an amount per movie, series or other programming commensurate with the quality (e.g., utility and perceived popularity) of the content being licensed.
Transmission
We uplink our programming to four non-pre-emptible, protected transponders on two satellites positioned in geo-synchronous orbit. These satellites feed our signals to various swaths of the Americas. We lease these transponders under long-term lease agreements. These transponder leases have termination dates in 2023. We transmit to these satellites from our uplink center in Englewood, Colorado. We have made arrangements at a third party facility to uplink our linear channels to these satellites in the event we are unable to do so from our uplink center.
Regulatory Matters
In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) regulates several aspects of our, and our distribution ecosystem’s operations and programming. This includes FCC oversight in connection with communications satellites and related uplink/downlink equipment and transmissions, content-specific requirements such as closed captioning, messaging during children’s programming, loudness of commercials, and program access requirements in connection with certain Distributors and programmer services with shared attributable interests. Additionally, as part of the FCC’s 2008 order approving the acquisition by Liberty Media Corporation (now known as Qurate Retail, Inc.) (“Liberty Media”) of a controlling interest in DIRECTV, the FCC imposed program access conditions on Liberty Media and its affiliated entities, which may remain applicable to Starz.
Online Services
To the extent that our programming services are distributed through online based platforms, we must comply with various federal and state laws and regulations applicable to online communications and commerce. Congress and individual states may consider additional legislation addressing online privacy and other issues.
Proposed Changes in Regulation

The regulation of programming services, cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite providers, broadcast television licensees and online distributed services is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux historically. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated and there can be no assurance that our business will not be materially adversely affected by future legislation, new regulation or deregulation.
Media Networks - STARZPLAY International 
STARZ, through its international premium branded SVOD service, STARZPLAY, is currently available in five countries and expected to launch in additional countries over the next several years.
The service is anchored by Starz and Lionsgate programming, as well as content from third party providers. Most content available on STARZPLAY is English-language, may include certain seasons of STARZ original series exclusively and may often 
18

air day-and-date with the U.S. STARZPLAY also includes access to a rich and diverse Lionsgate library of television series, feature films and documentaries, and, to amplify content from the Starz domestic slate, may include first-run, exclusive access to unique third party programming, including locally produced television shows that align with the STARZ brand. 
STARZPLAY is distributed through global wholesale partners, local IPTV or Telco partners, and is expected to be offered through retail partners over the next year. We believe that this multi-faceted approach to distribution will allow STARZPLAY to scale across multiple countries through new and existing distribution partners and supported platforms. 
STARZ also expands its international footprint through the following: STARZPLAY Arabia, a service that provides access to 19 different countries in the Middle East and North Africa (see Joint Ventures, Partnerships and Ownership Interests below); Celestial Tiger Entertainment, a service that provides access to China and Southeast Asia; and Bell Media, which has the exclusive rights to distribute the STARZ service in Canada across linear, on-demand and streaming platforms.
Media Networks - Streaming Services
Streaming services represent revenues derived from the Lionsgate legacy start-up direct to consumer streaming service initiatives on SVOD platforms including PANTAYA, our joint venture with Hemisphere Media Group. PANTAYA is the first-ever premium streaming destination for world-class movies in Spanish offering the largest selection of current and classic, commercial-free blockbusters and critically acclaimed titles from Latin America and the U.S. In February 2019, PANTAYA announced its first-ever original scripted series “El Juego de las Llaves” (The Game of Keys) which is expected to debut in the U.S. exclusively on PANTAYA in fall 2019, and will stream internationally in more than 200 countries and territories on Amazon Prime Video.
JOINT VENTURES, PARTNERSHIPS AND OWNERSHIP INTERESTS
Our joint ventures, partnerships and ownership interests support our strategy of being a multiplatform global industry leader in entertainment. We regularly evaluate our existing properties, libraries and other assets and businesses in order to determine whether they continue to enhance our competitive position in the industry, have the potential to generate significant long-term returns, represent an optimal use of our capital and are aligned with our goals. When appropriate, we discuss potential strategic transactions with third parties for purchase of our properties, libraries or other assets or businesses that factor into these evaluations. As a result, we may, from time to time, determine to sell individual properties, libraries or other assets or businesses or enter into additional joint ventures, strategic transactions and similar arrangements for individual properties, libraries or other assets or businesses. Certain of the Company’s joint ventures, partnerships and ownership interests include the following: 
19


3 Arts Entertainment | In May 2018, we acquired a majority stake in 3 Arts Entertainment, a leading talent management and television/film production company. 
Atom Tickets | In August 2014, we acquired an interest in Atom Tickets, a first-of-its-kind social movie ticketing app. 
Celestial Tiger Entertainment | In January 2012, we formed Celestial Tiger Entertainment, a joint venture with Saban Capital Group and Celestial Pictures, a company wholly-owned by Astro Overseas Limited. Celestial Tiger Entertainment is a leading independent media company dedicated to entertaining audiences in Asia and beyond that creates and distributes branded pay television channels and services targeted at Asian consumers.

Intellectual Property
We currently use and own or license a number of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names and similar intellectual property in connection with our businesses and own registrations and applications to register them both domestically and internationally. We believe that ownership of, and/or the right to use, such trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names and similar intellectual property is an important factor in our businesses and that our success depends, in part, on such ownership.
Motion picture and television piracy is extensive in many parts of the world, including South America, Asia and certain Eastern European countries, and is made easier by technological advances and the conversion of content into digital formats. This trend facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies of content on packaged media and through digital formats. The proliferation of unauthorized copies of these products has had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on our business, because these products may reduce the revenue we receive from our products. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time, we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.
Competition
Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets. We compete with companies within the entertainment and media business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, outdoor recreation and other cultural related activities. We compete with the major studios, numerous independent motion picture and television production companies, television networks, pay television services and digital media platforms for the acquisition of literary and film properties, the services of performing artists, directors, producers and other creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our businesses. In addition, our motion pictures compete for audience acceptance and exhibition outlets with motion pictures produced and distributed by other companies. Likewise, our television product faces significant competition from independent distributors as well as major studios. Moreover, our networks compete with other programming networks for viewing and subscribership by each distributor’s customer base, as well as for carriage by such distributors. As a result, the success of any of our motion picture, television or networks business is dependent not only on the quality and acceptance of a particular film or program, but also on the quality and acceptance of other competing content released into the marketplace at or near the same time as well as on the ability to license and produce content for the networks that is adequate in quantity and quality and will generate satisfactory subscriber levels.
20

Given such competition, we attempt to operate with a different business model than others. We typically emphasize a lower cost structure, risk mitigation, reliance on financial partnerships and innovative financial strategies. Our cost structures are designed to utilize our flexibility and agility as well as the entrepreneurial spirit of our employees, partners and affiliates, in order to provide creative entertainment content to serve diverse audiences worldwide.
Social Responsibility and Employee Engagement
Lionshares
We are committed to acting responsibly and making a positive difference in the local and global community through Lionshares, the umbrella for our companywide commitment to our communities. Lionshares is a volunteer program that seeks to provide opportunities for employees within the Lionsgate family to partner with a diverse range of charitable organizations. The program not only enriches the Lionsgate work experience through cultural and educational outreach, but also positively interacts and invests in the local and global community. 
Employee Resource Groups
We provide our employees with an opportunity to enhance cross-cultural awareness, develop leadership skills and network across the Company’s various business units and levels through resource groups including Lionsgate Multicultural Group, Lionsgate Pride, Lionsgate Vets and Lionsgate Women’s Empowerment Group.

• | Lionsgate Multicultural Group engages in partnerships that promote diversity, equity and inclusion within the Company and the industry, allowing for an exchange of ideas and resources that contribute to overall innovation.


• | Lionsgate Pride supports, develops and inspires future LGBTQ leaders within the Company and the industry.


• | Lionsgate Vets creates a community of veterans and their supporters working together to enhance veteran presence and engage the industry from the unique perspective of a military background.


• | Lionsgate Women’s Empowerment Group creates a community that improves the prominence of female leaders and empowers women at all levels within the Company and the industry.

Employees
As of May 20, 2019, we had 1,415 full-time employees in our worldwide operations. We also utilize many consultants in the ordinary course of our business and hire additional employees on a project-by-project basis in connection with the production of our motion pictures and television programming.
