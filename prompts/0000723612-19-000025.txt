OVERVIEW

We are a leading global provider of mobility solutions through our three most recognized brands, Avis, Budget and Zipcar, together with several other brands, well recognized in their respective markets. We and our licensees operate the Avis and Budget brands in approximately 180 countries throughout the world. We generally maintain a leading share of airport car rental revenue in North America, Europe and Australasia, and we operate one of the leading truck rental businesses in the United States.
Our differentiated brands help us meet a wide range of customer mobility needs throughout the world. Avis is a leading vehicle rental brand positioned to serve the premium commercial and leisure segments of the travel industry. Budget is a leading vehicle rental brand focused primarily on more value-conscious segments of the industry. Our Zipcar brand is one of the world’s leading car sharing networks offering an alternative to traditional vehicle rental and ownership. 
On average, our rental fleet totaled nearly 650,000 vehicles in 2018 and we completed more than 40 million vehicle rental transactions worldwide. We generate approximately 65% of our revenue from on-airport locations and approximately 35% of our revenue from off-airport locations. We license the use of the Avis, Budget, Zipcar and Payless trademarks to licensees in areas in which we do not operate directly. Our brands have an extended global reach with more than 11,000 car and truck rental locations throughout the world, including approximately 4,600 car rental locations operated by our licensees. We believe that Avis, Budget and Zipcar enjoy complementary demand patterns with mid-week commercial demand balanced by weekend leisure demand.
We operate Budget Truck, one of the leading truck rental businesses in the United States, through a network of dealer-operated and Company-operated locations throughout the continental United States. We also own Payless, a car rental brand that operates in the deep-value segment of the industry in the United States and certain other international regions; Apex, which is a leading deep-value car rental brand in New Zealand and Australia; Maggiore and Morini Rent, leading vehicle rental brands in Italy; Turiscar, a well-established car rental brand in Portugal; and FranceCars, which operates one of the largest light commercial vehicle fleets in France.

We categorize our operations into two reportable business segments: 

• | Americas, which provides and licenses the Company’s brands to third parties for vehicle rentals and ancillary products and services in North America, South America, Central America and the Caribbean, and operates the Company’s car sharing business in certain of these markets; and


• | International, which provides and licenses the Company’s brands to third parties for vehicle rentals and ancillary products and services in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australasia, and operates the Company’s car sharing business in certain of these markets.

Additional discussion of our reportable segments is included in the Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

COMPANY HISTORY

Avis was founded in 1946 and is believed to be the first company to rent cars from airport locations. Since its founding, Avis has expanded its business throughout the United States and internationally, becoming one of the largest and most recognized car rental brands in the world. In 1996, Avis was acquired by HFS Incorporated and in 1997 merged with our predecessor company, with the combined entity being renamed Cendant Corporation. In 2006, Cendant spun off several significant subsidiaries and changed its name to Avis Budget Group, Inc. The Company is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey.
Budget was founded in 1958 to appeal to the value-conscious car rental customer. In 2002, we acquired the Budget brand and certain Budget vehicle rental operations, including the Budget truck rental business. In 2011, we acquired Avis Europe, an independently-owned Company licensee, to expand our international operations and globally reunite the Avis and Budget brands. In 2012 and 2013, we acquired our Apex and Payless brands, respectively, which allowed us to expand our presence in the deep-value segment of the car rental industry. In 2013, we acquired Zipcar, one of the world’s leading car sharing networks, to better serve a greater variety of our customers’ mobility needs. In 2015, we acquired Maggiore, a leading provider of vehicle rental services in Italy. In 2016, we acquired FranceCars, a privately held vehicle rental company based in France, which significantly expanded our presence in the French market. In 2018, we acquired Morini, which focuses on rentals of cars, vans and refrigerated trucks in Northern Italy, and Turiscar, a well-established vehicle rental company in Portugal, and also invested in our licensee in Greece. These acquisitions have allowed us to continue to expand our global footprint of Company-operated locations and brand presence.

OUR STRATEGY

Our objective is to drive sustainable, profitable growth for our Company by delivering strategic initiatives aimed at winning and retaining customers through differentiated brands and products, increasing our margins via revenue growth and operational efficiency and enhancing our leadership in the evolving mobility industry.
Supporting and Strengthening Our Brands
In executing our strategy, we will continue to position our distinct and well-recognized global brands to focus on different segments of customer demand, complemented by our other brands in their respective regional markets. While our brands address different use-cases and target customers, we achieve efficiencies by sharing the same operational and administrative infrastructure while providing differentiated value propositions tailored to each of our brands.
We currently operate our brands, either directly or through independent operators and licensees around the world and we plan to continue to strengthen and further expand our global footprint through organic growth and, potentially, through acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing agreements or other relationships:

• | In countries where we have Company-operated locations, we will continue to identify opportunities to add new rental locations, to grant licenses to independent third parties for areas where we do not currently operate and do not wish to operate directly, to strengthen the presence of our brands and in certain cases to re-acquire previously granted license rights.


• | In countries operated by licensees or partners, we will seek to ensure that those businesses are well positioned to realize the growth potential of our brands in those countries and are growing their presence in those markets, and in certain cases we will continue to consider the re-acquisition of previously granted license rights.


• | In countries where we have either Company-operated or licensee-operated locations, we will also continue to identify opportunities to leverage our Zipcar brand and its car sharing model, which allows us to fulfill the expanding urban mobility needs of customers.

Since our Avis brand represents approximately 58% of our revenue and is recognized as a global leader in vehicle rental, we are particularly focused on maintaining and building its reputation as a reliably high-quality service provider. Our Avis Preferred loyalty program, which offers our customers the ability to bypass the rental 
4

counter and also earn reward points, coupled with our continued investment in technology, including our Avis mobile application and websites, and our growing fleet of connected cars, are all key parts of our efforts to enhance the Avis experience for our customers.
We aim to provide a range of vehicles, products and services at competitive prices, to leverage various marketing channels and to maintain marketing affiliations and corporate account contracts that complement each brand’s positioning. We also continue to invest in our brands through a variety of efforts, including both on-line and off-line marketing. We continue to see particular growth opportunities for Budget and our other local brands in Europe, as the share of airport car rentals for Budget is significantly smaller in Europe than in certain other parts of the world.
To further support and strengthen our brands, we are committed to serving our customers and enhancing their rental experience through new organic offerings that optimize our brands, our systems and our employees. We frequently solicit feedback from and survey our customers to better understand their needs and we have implemented actions to enhance our services, including the following:

• | We created our Avis mobile application to provide a higher quality end-to-end user experience, building upon direct feedback from customers to re-design the rental experience to meet their needs. Our Avis mobile application allows customers to reserve, update and cancel reservations, choose their car, exchange or upgrade their vehicle, add ancillary products, extend rentals, return the vehicle with one click, view and share current and past rental receipts to expedite expense processing, review rental agreement details and the vehicle’s insurance card, and, in the case of connected vehicles, lock and unlock the vehicle, confirm their fuel level at the beginning and end of their rental as well as miles driven, using their mobile device;


• | We continue to upgrade our technology and the ways it can further serve our customers, to make the vehicle reservation, pick-up and return processes more convenient and user-friendly, with a particular emphasis on enabling and simplifying our customers’ online transactions. We have partnered with other technology and product companies to continuously improve the user experience through various mobile and technology capabilities. These include working with Amazon to allow for voice-controlled access to our services through Amazon Alexa enabled devices; and


• | We piloted and subsequently launched “Curbside Delivery” services in select U.S. airport markets, in which customers can bring their car to the Avis and Budget return lot, where an Avis or Budget employee will drive them to their appointed terminal or gate and complete the vehicle return process transaction at the curb.

We will continue to invest in these and other innovative efforts, with a particular emphasis on technologies, services and products that will allow us to not only serve customers more effectively and efficiently, but offer new brand-differentiating options.
Margins and Operational Efficiency
Our strategy is focused on identifying and implementing actions to increase our margins over the next several years. We see significant potential in opportunities that optimize our pricing and customer mix; increase sales of ancillary products and services through new product and service development; optimize our procurement processes; refine the deployment and disposition of vehicles (e.g. increasing the use of non-auction channels for selling our vehicles); drive operational efficiency in our business; and apply connected car/in-vehicle systems and other innovative mobility technologies in our operations.
We continue to pursue opportunities intended to drive our margins and increase our revenues and profitability, including:

• | Offering our customers useful ancillary products and services, promoting car class upgrades, adjusting our mix of vehicles to match customer demand; repositioning our sales strategy to focus on the most profitable segments, increasing the number of rentals that customers book directly through our websites and mobile applications and increasing the proportion of “Pay Now” transactions by which customers prepay for rentals.


• | Investing in yield management and pricing analytics tools, such as our Revenue Management System, to increase the profits we earn per rental day. We have implemented, and plan to continue deploying, new technology systems that strengthen our yield management decisions and enable us to tailor our product,

5

service and price offerings to meet our customers’ needs and react quickly to shifting market conditions. We will continue to adjust our pricing to improve profitability and manage our fleet to match changes in demand. 

• | Managing and improving our fleet decisions to better optimize and drive the purchase, deployment, and disposition of our fleet to lower costs and meet customer demand, grow our direct-to-dealer and consumer sales performance, reduce maintenance and repair expenses, better optimize our salvage costs, reduce the risk of damage to our vehicles, and improve fleet utilization benefits and savings by combining our vehicle rental and car sharing fleets when appropriate which we believe will create significant financial benefits.


• | Seeking opportunities where our investments will generate strong margin returns, including expanding rental locations, acquiring and integrating existing licensees in key markets, participating in joint ventures and acquiring leading local brands.


• | Increasing our Zipcar membership base within its existing markets, as well as expanding the brand into new markets.

We also continued to focus our efforts on rigorously controlling our costs, aggressively reducing expenses and increasing efficiencies throughout our organization by:

• | Implementing process improvements throughout our business to increase efficiencies, reduce operating costs and create sustainable cost savings.


• | Achieving reductions in underlying direct operating and selling, general and administrative expenses, including reductions in staff where and when appropriate.


• | Assessing location, segment and transaction profitability to address less-profitable aspects of our business and focus on the more-profitable accounts that will help drive increased margins.


• | Deploying changes to our sales, marketing and affinity programs to improve profitability.


• | Integrating our acquired businesses, to realize cost efficiencies from combined maintenance, systems, technology and administrative infrastructure.


• | Implementing innovative technological solutions like self-service voice reservation technology, mobile communications with customers and fleet optimization technologies to reduce costs.

We believe such operational improvements will continue to assist and in some cases, drive our financial performance.
Our Evolving Mobility Platform
We believe our Company is well-positioned as a global leader in the evolving mobility marketplace. Mobility is more than providing a clean reliable car of choice for a customer to use to get from point A to point B; it also means providing our customers the choice to rent a vehicle or share a vehicle, and to do so by the year, month, week, day, hour or fraction of an hour. Mobility means our customers, using their smartphones or tablets, can customize their experiences with our products, services, and employees, bypass the counter or change their minds about the make or model of a vehicle and review their options on their mobile device right up to the moment they exit the parking lot. Mobility also means providing customers with choices even on the shortest trips, including how they want to be transported to or from their rental vehicles at the airport or by providing them with real time data about the wait time for the next shuttle.
When our customers return their rental vehicles to our fleet, whether at an airport or off-airport facility or a designated customer parking spot, our preferred customers can receive their complete charges for their transaction including gas, ancillary products use, and any other applicable charges, via email or text, within minutes of their proper return of the vehicle. In the future we intend to deliver more data content to our customers in their vehicles and to their devices that will provide them with customized access to useful information they want to know about, including eating, shopping, lodging, emergency assistance and tips on just enjoying the location they are visiting.
With our connected cars, mobility means being able to collect data about the car that will improve customer service and vehicle safety. It also means that we will be able to provide a new suite of services for clients who are looking to utilize our operational experience and our technology to maintain and manage their own fleets, and provide supply chain services with quality and precision at levels that exceed their ability to do so themselves. 
6

Our current and growing list of business partnerships with other mobility service providers in adjacent business models allows us to offer more options to our business and leisure customers to satisfy a wide variety of mobility needs.
For our shareholders, mobility means seizing opportunities that will increase our overall value through strategies that expand the use of our technologies, fleet and employees, open new markets, increase revenue and margins across all our brands; and maintain our strength as an innovator in the expanding mobility market.
Since 2017, we have undertaken several initiatives and entered into partnerships in support of our strategy, including:

• | Exceeding our goal of having more than 100,000 connected vehicles in our U.S. Avis fleet in 2018, delivering both customer benefits and operational efficiencies, including entering into agreements with Ford and Toyota to connect all their vehicles in our U.S. Avis fleet. We also expect to expand connected vehicles in Europe during 2019, bringing us closer to our goal of having a 100% global connected fleet;


• | Our launch of our first-ever Mobility Lab in the Kansas City, Missouri area, utilizing fully connected vehicles that allows us to leverage our capabilities to deliver operational efficiencies through on-demand inventory counts, mileage management and automated maintenance notifications that enhance and optimize the Company’s fleet management capabilities;


• | Our integration with Amazon Alexa, which allows travelers to book and manage their car rental reservations through the voice platform on Amazon Echo;


• | Our partnership with Waymo, an Alphabet Inc. company, through which we are offering fleet support and maintenance services for their growing fleet of autonomous vehicles in Phoenix, Arizona. This provides a unique opportunity to grow our understanding of the support and operational maintenance requirements for self-driving vehicles at the fleet level, including staffing and facility requirements;


• | Our focus on emerging technologies through our collaboration with various international and local technology incubators;


• | Our partnership with Lyft, in which we are enabling Lyft drivers across North America the ability to use Avis vehicles on a monthly and weekly basis as an alternative to using their own personal vehicle;


• | Our partnership with Brightline in Florida, the only privately owned and operated passenger rail service in the United States, in which we offer Brightline passengers and those living or working near Brightline’s stations convenient access to Avis and Zipcar vehicles that can be reserved via integration with the Brightline app; and


• | Our use of Amazon Web Services’ (“AWS”) Connected Vehicle Solution to build our data analytics platform, providing highly secure and scalable cloud services and allows us to leverage AWS’ capabilities for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data management to develop a wide variety of innovative connected vehicle applications and mobility services.

We are committed to finding new and innovative ways of thinking and operating, and to leverage our technology, employees, global presence and capabilities to be leaders among the contributors that are now shaping the evolving mobility market.

OUR BRANDS AND OPERATIONS

OUR BRANDS
Our Avis, Budget and Zipcar brands are three of the most recognized brands in our industry. We believe that we enjoy significant benefits from operating our brands with services and products targeted to different customers and sharing the same maintenance facilities, fleet management systems, technology and administrative infrastructure. In addition, we are able to recognize significant benefits and savings by combining our car rental and car sharing maintenance activities and fleets at times to increase our fleet utilization efficiency and to meet demand peaks. We believe that Avis, Budget and Zipcar all enjoy complementary demand patterns with mid-week commercial demand balanced by weekend leisure demand. We also operate the Apex and Payless brands, which operate in the deep-value segment of the car rental industry, augmenting our Avis, Budget and Zipcar brands. In addition, our Maggiore and Morini brands in Italy, FranceCars brand in France and Turiscar brand in Portugal further extend the range of vehicle use occasions we are able to serve.

The Avis brand provides high-quality vehicle rental and other mobility solutions at price points generally above non-branded and value-branded vehicle rental companies to serve the premium commercial and leisure segments of the travel industry. We operate or license the Avis vehicle rental system (the “Avis System”), one of the largest global vehicle rental systems, at approximately 5,500 locations worldwide, including in virtually all of the largest commercial airports and cities in the world.
The Avis System is comprised of an approximately equal number of company-owned and licensee vehicle rental locations worldwide, in both the on-airport and off-airport, or local, rental markets.

The following graphs present the approximate composition of our Avis revenue by segment, customer and market in 2018.
We also license the Avis System to independent commercial owners who operate approximately half of our locations worldwide and generally pay royalty fees to us based on a percentage of applicable revenue. In 2018, approximately 33% of the global Avis System revenue was generated by our licensees. The graphs below present the approximate composition of the Avis System revenue in 2018.

We offer Avis customers a variety of premium services, including:

• | the Avis mobile application, which allows customers a new and innovative way to control many elements of their rental experience via their mobile devices without the need to visit the rental counter.

Budget
The Budget brand is a leading supplier of vehicle rental and other mobility solutions focused primarily on more value-conscious customers. We operate or license the Budget vehicle rental system (the “Budget System”), which is comprised of vehicle rental locations at most of the largest airports and cities in the world. 
The table below presents the approximate number of locations that comprise the Budget System as of December 31, 2018.

Budget offers its customers several products and services similar to Avis, such as refueling options, roadside assistance, electronic toll collection, curbside dropoff and other supplemental rental products, emailed receipts and special rental rates for frequent renters. In addition, Budget’s mobile application allows customers to reserve, modify and cancel reservations on their mobile device, and its Fastbreak service, expedites rental service for frequent travelers.
Budget Truck
Our Budget Truck rental business is one of the largest local and one-way truck rental businesses in the United States. As of December 31, 2018, our Budget Truck fleet is comprised of approximately 18,000 vehicles that are rented through a network of approximately 640 dealer-operated and 430 Company-operated locations throughout the continental United States. These dealers are independently-owned businesses that generally operate other retail service businesses. In addition to their principal businesses, the dealers rent our light- and medium-duty trucks to customers and are responsible for collecting payments on our behalf. The dealers receive a commission on all truck and ancillary equipment rentals. The Budget Truck rental business serves both the consumer and light commercial sectors. The consumer sector consists primarily of individuals who rent trucks to move household goods on either a one-way or local basis. The light commercial sector consists of a wide range of businesses that rent light- to medium-duty trucks, which we define as trucks having a gross vehicle weight of less than 26,000 
10

pounds, for a variety of commercial applications.
Zipcar
Zipcar operates one of the world’s leading membership-based car sharing networks, which provides its members on-demand access to vehicles in over 500 cities and towns and at more than 600 college campuses around the world. Zipcar provides its members on-demand, self-service vehicles in reserved parking spaces located in neighborhoods, business districts, office complexes, college campuses and airports, as an alternative to car ownership. Members can reserve vehicles online, on a mobile device or over the phone, by the minute, hour or by the day, at rates that include gasoline, insurance and other costs associated with vehicle ownership. In 2018, we widened Zipcar’s product offering by launching our Zipcar Commuter product, which is now available in 11 major markets in North America and provides unlimited, sole access to a vehicle and dedicated parking spot for Zipcar members who commute outside of the city for work. We also began offering our Zipcar “Flex” product in London providing for one-way rentals that are typically at a lower price than ride-hailing services.
Other Brands
Our Payless brand is a leading rental car supplier positioned to serve the deep-value segment of the vehicle rental industry. We operate or license the Payless brand, which is comprised of approximately 280 locations worldwide, including approximately 120 Company-operated locations and more than 160 locations operated by licensees. Company-operated Payless locations are primarily located in North America, the majority of which are at or near major airports. Payless’ rental fees are often lower than those of larger, more established brands, but Payless has historically achieved a greater penetration of ancillary products and services with its customers. The Payless business model allows the Company to extend the life-cycle of a portion of our fleet, as we “cascade” certain vehicles that exceed certain Avis and Budget age or mileage thresholds to be used by Payless. 
Our Apex brand operates in the deep-value segment of the vehicle rental industry in New Zealand and Australia, where we have approximately 30 rental locations. Apex operates its own rental fleet, separate from Avis and Budget vehicles. Apex generates its reservations through its proprietary websites as well as its contact center and online travel agencies and typically has a greater-than-average length of rental. Apex operates rental locations at, or near, major airports and in several metropolitan cities.
Our Maggiore brand is a leading vehicle rental brand in Italy, where we operate or license approximately 140 rental locations under the Maggiore name. Our Maggiore brand has a strong domestic reputation and benefits from a strong presence at airport, off-airport and railway locations, and benefits from the integration of our existing operations and fleet management expertise. In addition, our recently acquired Morini brand is a leading vehicle rental brand in Italy, which offers rental of cars, vans and refrigerated vehicles. We operate or license more than 40 rental locations under the Morini name throughout the country.
Our FranceCars brand operates one of the largest light commercial vehicle fleets in France from approximately 85 rental locations and leverages our existing operational processes and local customer base.
Our recently acquired Turiscar brand is a leading vehicle rental brand in Portugal, primarily in the corporate market, including light commercial vehicles, from approximately 25 rental locations throughout the country.
RESERVATIONS, MARKETING AND SALES
Reservations
Our customers can make vehicle rental reservations through our brand-specific websites and toll-free reservation centers, by calling a specific location directly, through our brand-specific mobile applications, online travel agencies, travel agents or through selected partners, including many major airlines, associations and retailers. Travel agents can access our reservation systems through all major global distribution systems, which provide information with respect to rental locations, vehicle availability and applicable rate structures. 
Our Zipcar members may reserve cars by the minute, hour or by the day through Zipcar’s reservation system, which is accessible through the Zipcar website, through the Zipcar application on their smartphone or by phone. 
11

We also provide two-way SMS texting, enabling us to proactively reach out to members during their reservation via their mobile device to manage their reservation, including instant reservation extension.
Marketing and Sales
We support our brands through a range of marketing channels and campaigns, including traditional media, such as television and print advertising, as well as Internet and email marketing, social media and mobile device applications. We market through sponsorships of major sports entities such as the PGA Tour, the New York Yankees, the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto FC. We also market through sponsorships of charitable organizations such as the Make-A-Wish Foundation. We utilize a customer relationship management system that enables us to deliver more targeted and relevant offers to customers across online and offline channels and allows our customers to benefit through better and more relevant marketing, improved service delivery and loyalty programs that reward frequent renters with free rental days and car class upgrades. 
We maintain strong links to the travel industry including marketing alliances with numerous marketing partners, such as:

• | Many major airlines, including Air Canada, Air France, Air New Zealand, American Airlines, British Airways, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia Airlines, Japan Airlines, JetBlue Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, Norwegian Air, Qantas, SAS, Southwest Airlines, Virgin America and WestJet Airlines;


• | Many major hotel companies, including Best Western International, Inc., Choice Hotels International, Hyatt Corporation, MGM Resorts International, Radisson Hotels and Resorts, Universal Parks & Resorts and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts and in 2018, we became the exclusive car rental partner of Luxury Retreats, an Airbnb worldwide villa rental company;


• | Offering customers the ability to earn frequent traveler points with many major airlines’ and hotels’ frequent traveler programs. We are the exclusive rental partner of the Aeroplan, JetBlue and Wyndham Rewards loyalty programs; and


• | Relationships with non-travel entities, such as affinity groups, membership organizations, retailers, financial institutions and credit card companies.


In addition, we developed new relationships that provide brand exposure and access to new customers, including a multi-year deal with Lyft to provide vehicles to the Lyft Express Drive Program in cities across North America, an agreement with Amazon to reward customers who rent an Avis or Budget car with gift cards, and a mobility partnership with Brightline, a privately owned passenger rail service in Florida.
Approximately 60% of vehicle rental transactions in 2018 from our Company-operated Avis locations were generated by travelers who rented from Avis under contracts between Avis and their employers or through membership in an organization with which Avis has a contractual affiliation (such as AARP and Costco Wholesale). Avis also maintains marketing relationships with other organizations such as American Express, MasterCard International and others, through which we are able to provide their customers with incentives to rent from Avis. Generally, Avis licensees also have the option to participate in these affiliations.
Additionally, we offer “Unlimited Rewards®,” an award-winning loyalty incentive program for travel agents, and Avis and Budget programs for small businesses that offer discounted rates, central billing options and rental credits to members. Budget has contractual arrangements with American Express, MasterCard International and other organizations, which offer members incentives to rent from Budget.
Our Zipcar brand also partners with other active lifestyle brands that appeal to our Zipcar members and we organize, sponsor and participate in charitable and community events with organizations that are important to our Zipcar members. Zipcar maintains close relationships with universities that allow us to market to the “next generation consumer” who, upon graduation, may continue their relationship with us and advocate for broad sponsorship of Zipcar membership at their places of work. Through our Zipcar for Business program, we also offer reduced weekday driving rates to employees of companies, federal agencies and local governments that sponsor the use of Zipcars.

LICENSING
We have licensees in approximately 175 countries throughout the world. Royalty fee revenue derived from our vehicle rental licensees in 2018 totaled $135 million, with approximately $97 million in our International segment and $38 million in our Americas segment. Licensed locations are independently operated by our licensees and range from large operations at major airport locations and territories encompassing entire countries to relatively small operations in suburban or rural locations. Our licensees generally maintain separate independently owned and operated fleets. Royalties generated from licensing provide us with a source of high-margin revenue because there are relatively limited additional costs associated with fees paid by licensees to us. Locations operated by licensees represented approximately 45% of our Avis and Budget vehicle rental locations worldwide and approximately 31% of total revenue generated by the Avis and Budget Systems in 2018. We facilitate one-way vehicle rentals between Company-operated and licensed locations, which enables us to offer an integrated network of locations to our customers.
We generally enjoy good relationships with our licensees and meet regularly with them at regional, national and international meetings. Our relationships with our licensees are governed by license agreements that grant the licensee the right to operate independently operated vehicle rental businesses in certain territories. Our license agreements generally provide our licensees with the exclusive right to operate under one or more of our brands in their assigned territory. These agreements impose obligations on the licensee regarding its operations, and most agreements restrict the licensee’s ability to sell, transfer or assign its rights granted under the license agreement or to change the control of its ownership without our consent. 
The terms of our license agreements, including duration, royalty fees and termination provisions, vary based upon brand, territory, and original signing date. Royalty fees are generally structured to be a percentage of the licensee’s gross rental income. We maintain the right to monitor the operations of licensees and, when applicable, can declare a licensee to be in default under its license agreement. We perform audits as part of our program to assure licensee compliance with brand quality standards and contract provisions. Generally, we can terminate license agreements for certain defaults, including failure to pay royalties or to adhere to our operational standards. Upon termination of a license agreement, the licensee is prohibited from using our brand names and related marks in any business. In the United States, these license relationships constitute “franchises” under most federal and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises and the relationship of the parties to a franchise agreement.
We continue to optimize the Avis and Budget Systems by issuing new license agreements and periodically acquiring licensees to grow our revenues and expand our global presence. Discussion of our recent acquisitions is included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
OTHER REVENUE
In addition to revenue from our vehicle rentals and licensee royalties, we generate revenue from our customers through the sale and/or rental of optional ancillary products and services. We offer products to customers that will enhance their rental experience, including:

• | collision and loss damage waivers, under which we agree to relieve a customer from financial responsibility arising from vehicle damage incurred during the rental;


• | additional/supplemental liability insurance or personal accident/effects insurance products which provide customers with additional protections for personal or third-party losses incurred;


• | products for driving convenience such as fuel service options, chauffeur drive services, roadside assistance services, electronic toll collection services, curbside dropoff, tablet rentals, access to satellite radio, portable navigation units and child safety seat rentals; and


• | products that supplement truck rental including automobile towing equipment and other moving accessories such as hand trucks, furniture pads and moving supplies.

13

We offer customized bundling of certain of these ancillary products and services, allowing our customers to benefit from discounted pricing and providing customers the flexibility to add multiple products or services that suit their needs.
We also receive payment from our customers for certain operating expenses that we incur, including vehicle licensing fees, as well as airport concession fees that we pay in exchange for the right to operate at airports and other locations. In addition, we collect membership fees in connection with our car sharing business.
OUR TECHNOLOGIES
Vehicle Rental
We use a broad range of technologies in our vehicle rental operations, substantially all of which are linked to what we call our Wizard system, which is a worldwide reservation, rental, fleet control, data processing and information management system. The Wizard system enables us to process millions of incoming customer inquiries each day, providing our customers with accurate and timely information about our locations, rental rates and vehicle availability, as well as the ability to place or modify reservations. Additionally, the Wizard system is linked to virtually all major travel distribution networks worldwide and provides real-time processing for travel agents, travel industry partners (such as airlines and online travel sites), corporate travel departments and individual consumers through our websites or contact centers. The Wizard system also provides personal profile information to our reservation and rental agents to help us better serve our customers. 
We also use data supplied from the Wizard system and other third-party reservation and information management systems to maintain centralized control of major business processes such as fleet acquisition and logistics, sales to corporate accounts and determination of pricing. The principal components of the systems we employ include: 

• | Fleet planning model. We have a comprehensive decision tool to develop fleet plans and schedules for the acquisition and disposition of our fleet, along with fleet age, mix, mileage and cost reports, allowing management to monitor and change fleet deployment on a daily basis and to optimize our fleet plan based on estimated business levels and available repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs.


• | Revenue management system. We have a revenue management system which is designed to enhance profitability by providing greater control of vehicle availability, inventory movements and pricing at our rental locations. Our system monitors and forecasts both vehicle supply and customer demand to support our strategy to optimize volume and rate at each location. An integrated fleet distribution module takes into consideration the costs and benefits associated with distributing vehicles to various rental locations within a geographic area to accommodate demand, and make specific recommendations for movement of vehicles between locations. We utilize sophisticated systems to gather and report competitive industry rental rate changes every day using data from third-party reservation systems, which automatically scan rate movements and report significant changes for evaluation.


• | Websites and mobile applications. Our websites and mobile applications leverage our technology across brands and provide a simpler, streamlined experience for our customers.


• | Connected car services application. We have developed an enterprise-wide application that interfaces with various telematics solutions that support our self-service and connected car strategy. This application, among other things, enables a more accurate reading of fuel and mileage to enable a customer to self-service check-out and check-in their vehicle.


• | Campaign management. We have deployed tools that enable us to recognize customer segments and value, and to automatically present appropriate offers on our websites.


• | Interactive adjustments. We have developed a customer data system that allows us to easily retrieve pertinent customer information and make needed adjustments to completed rental transactions online for superior customer service.

Car Sharing
Our Zipcar car sharing technology was specifically designed and built for our car sharing business and has been continually refined and upgraded. Our fully-integrated platform centralizes the management of our Zipcar reservations, member services, fleet operations and financial systems to optimize the member experience, minimize costs and leverage efficiencies. Our platform allows for basic functions such as processing new member applications, managing reservations and keyless vehicle access, and providing the mobile and website applications used by our members. This platform also allows us to manage and monitor member interactions and communications, billing and payment processing, manage our car sharing fleet, including service and cleanings, vehicle locations and monitor and analyze key metrics of each Zipcar such as utilization rate, mileage and maintenance requirements.
Each Zipcar is typically equipped with a combination of telematics modules, including a control unit with mobile data service, radio frequency identification card readers, wireless antennae, wiring harness, vehicle interface modules and transponders for toll systems. This hardware, together with internally developed embedded firmware, vehicle communication protocols and datacenter software, allows us to authorize secure access to our Zipcars from our data centers and provides us with a comprehensive set of fleet management data that is stored in our centralized database. 
Interactions between members and our Zipcars are captured in our system, across all communication channels, providing us with knowledge we use to improve our members’ experiences and optimize our business processes. We continue to innovate our technology platform to provide scale to support growth, drive operational efficiency and improve the member experience.
OUR FLEET
We offer a wide variety of vehicles in our rental fleet, including luxury cars, specialty-use vehicles and light commercial vehicles. Our fleet consists primarily of vehicles from the current and immediately preceding model year. We maintain a single fleet of vehicles for Avis and Budget in countries where we operate both brands. The substantial majority of Zipcar’s fleet is dedicated to use by Zipcar. We maintain a diverse rental fleet, in which no vehicle manufacturer represented more than 14% of our 2018 fleet purchases, and we regularly adjust our fleet levels to be consistent with demand. We participate in a variety of vehicle purchase programs with major vehicle manufacturers. The following presents the approximate percentage of fleet purchases by manufacturer in 2018.
* Includes all manufacturers for which fleet purchases were less than 5%.
15

Fleet costs represented approximately 25% of our aggregate expenses in 2018. Fleet costs can vary from year to year based on the prices at which we are able to purchase and dispose of rental vehicles. 
In 2018, on average, approximately 38% of our rental car fleet was comprised of vehicles subject to agreements requiring automobile manufacturers to repurchase vehicles at a specified price during a specified time period or guarantee our rate of depreciation on the vehicles during a specified period of time, or were vehicles subject to operating leases, which are subject to a fixed lease period and interest rate. We refer to cars subject to these agreements as “program” cars and cars not subject to these agreements as “risk” cars because we retain the risk associated with such cars’ residual values at the time of their disposition. The following graphs present the approximate percentage of program cars in both our average rental car fleet and fleet purchases within each of our reporting segments in the last three years.

Our agreements with automobile manufacturers typically require that we pay more for program cars and maintain them in our fleet for a minimum number of months and impose certain return conditions, including car condition and mileage requirements. When we return program cars to the manufacturer, we receive the price guaranteed at the time of purchase and are therefore protected from fluctuations in the prices of previously-owned vehicles in the wholesale market. In 2018, approximately 54% of the vehicles we disposed of were sold pursuant to repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs. The future percentages of program and risk cars in our fleet will depend on several factors, including our expectations for future used car prices, our seasonal needs and the availability and attractiveness of manufacturers’ repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs.
We dispose of our risk cars largely through automobile auctions and direct-to-dealer sales. In 2018, we continued to expand the scope of our direct-to-consumer car sales program to include the sale of our risk cars directly to consumers through our retail lots in several U.S. cities and through our Ultimate Test Drive program, which offers customers the ability to purchase well-maintained, late-model rental vehicles from our rental car fleet. Alternative disposition channels such as direct-to-consumer, online auctions, retail lots and direct-to-dealer sales provide the opportunity to increase vehicle sale prices and reduce relevant fleet costs compared to selling cars at auctions.
In 2018, our average monthly vehicle rental fleet size ranged from a low of approximately 557,000 vehicles in January to a high of approximately 746,000 vehicles in July. Our average monthly car rental fleet size typically peaks in the summer months. Average fleet utilization for 2018, which is based on the number of rental days (or portion thereof) that vehicles are rented compared to the total amount of time that vehicles are available for rent, ranged from 65% in January to 75% in July. Our calculation of utilization may not be comparable to other companies’ calculation of similarly titled metrics.
16

We place a strong emphasis on the quality of our vehicle maintenance for customer safety and customer satisfaction reasons, and because quick and proper repairs are critical to fleet utilization. To accomplish this task, we developed specialized training programs for our technicians. Our Maintenance and Damage Planning Department prepares technical service bulletins that can be retrieved electronically at our repair locations. In addition, we have implemented policies and procedures to promptly address manufacturer recalls as part of our ongoing maintenance and repair efforts.
CUSTOMER SERVICE
Our commitment to delivering a consistently high level of customer service across all of our brands is a critical element of our success and business strategy. Our Customer Led, Service Driven™ program focuses on continually improving the overall customer experience based on our research of customer service practices, improved customer insights, executing our customer relationship management strategy, delivering customer-centric employee training and leverage our mobile applications technology and the enriched experience it provides our customers. 
The employees at our Company-operated locations are trained and empowered to resolve most customer issues at the location level. We also continuously track customer-satisfaction levels by sending location-specific surveys to recent customers and utilize detailed reports and tracking to assess and identify ways that we can improve our customer service delivery and the overall customer experience. Our location-specific surveys ask customers to evaluate their overall satisfaction with their rental experience and the likelihood that they will recommend our brands, as well as key elements of the rental experience. Results are analyzed in aggregate and by location to help further enhance our service levels to our customers.
We understand our customers’ time is valuable and we offer rental options that provide greater control and self-service capabilities. While our mobile applications provide a fast customer experience, our customers know a company representative is always available to meet their needs. Our survey platform includes specific questions to learn more about individual preferences and find innovative ways to better serve and anticipate our customers’ needs.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 30,000 people worldwide, of whom approximately 8,800 were employed on a part-time basis. Of our approximately 30,000 employees, approximately 18,000 were employed in our Americas segment and 12,000 in our International segment. 
In our Americas segment, the majority of our employees are at-will employees and, therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. Certain of our executive officers may be employed under employment contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other benefits. In our International segment, we enter into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction. Many of our employees are covered by a variety of union contracts and governmental regulations affecting, among other things, compensation, job retention rights and pensions.
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 27% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements with various labor unions. We believe our employee relations are satisfactory.
AIRPORT CONCESSION AGREEMENTS
We generally operate our vehicle rental and car sharing services at airports under concession agreements with airport authorities, pursuant to which we typically make airport concession payments and/or lease payments. In general, concession fees for on-airport locations are based on a percentage of total commissionable revenue (as defined by each airport authority), often subject to minimum annual guaranteed amounts. Concessions are typically awarded by airport authorities every three to ten years based upon competitive bids. Our concession agreements with the various airport authorities generally impose certain minimum operating requirements, provide for relocation in the event of future construction and provide for abatement of the minimum annual guarantee in the event of extended low passenger volume.

OTHER BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS

SEASONALITY
Our vehicle rental business is subject to seasonal variations in customer demand patterns, with the spring and summer vacation periods representing our peak seasons for the majority of the countries in which we operate. We vary our fleet size over the course of the year to help manage any seasonal variations in demand, as well as localized changes in demand. The following chart presents our quarterly revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.
COMPETITION
The competitive environment for our industry is generally characterized by intense price and service competition among global, local and regional competitors. Competition in our vehicle rental operations is based primarily upon price, customer service quality, including usability of booking systems and ease of rental and return, vehicle availability, reliability, rental locations, product innovation and national or international distribution. In addition, competition is also influenced strongly by advertising, marketing, loyalty programs and brand reputation. We believe the prominence and service reputation of our brands, extensive worldwide ownership of mobility solutions and commitment to innovation provides us with a competitive advantage.
The use of technology has increased pricing transparency among vehicle rental companies and other mobility solutions providers enabling cost-conscious customers to more easily compare on the Internet and their mobile devices the rates available for the mobility solutions that fit their needs. This transparency has further increased the prevalence and intensity of price competition in the industry. 
Our vehicle rental operations compete primarily with Enterprise Holdings, Inc., which operates the Enterprise, National and Alamo car rental brands; Hertz Global Holdings, Inc., which operates the Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty brands; Europcar Mobility Group, which operates the Europcar, Goldcar, InterRent and Ubeeqo brands; and Sixt AG. We also compete with smaller local and regional vehicle rental companies for vehicle rental market share, and with ride-hailing companies largely for short length trips in urban areas. Our Zipcar brand also competes with various local and regional mobility companies, including mobility services sponsored by several auto manufacturers, ride-hailing and car sharing companies and other technology players in the mobility industry. Our Budget Truck operations in the United States competes with several other local, regional and nationwide truck rental companies including U-Haul International, Inc., Penske Truck Leasing Corporation, Ryder Systems, Inc. and Enterprise.

INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Our vehicle rental and corporate operations expose us to various types of claims for bodily injury, death and property damage related to the use of our vehicles and/or properties, as well as general employment-related matters stemming from our operations. We generally retain economic exposure for liability to third parties arising from vehicle rental and car sharing services in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, in accordance with the minimum financial responsibility requirements (“MFRs”) and primacy of coverage laws of the relevant jurisdiction. In certain cases, we assume liability above applicable MFRs, up to $1 million per occurrence, other than in cases involving a negligent act on the part of the Company, for which we purchase insurance coverage for exposures beyond retained amounts from a combination of unaffiliated excess insurers. 
In Europe, we insure the risk of liability to third parties arising from vehicle rental and car sharing services in accordance with local regulatory requirements primarily through insurance policies provided by unaffiliated insurers. We may retain a portion of the insured risk of liability through local deductibles, and by reinsuring certain risks through our captive insurance subsidiary AEGIS Motor Insurance Limited. In Australasia, motor vehicle bodily injury insurance coverage is compulsory and provided upon vehicle registration. In addition, we provide our customers with third-party property damage insurance through an unaffiliated third-party insurer. We retain a share of property damage risk through local deductibles and through AEGIS Motor Insurance Limited. We insure the risk of liability to third parties in Argentina and Brazil through unaffiliated insurers. 
We offer our U.S. customers a range of optional insurance products and coverages such as supplemental liability insurance, personal accident insurance, personal effects protection, emergency sickness protection, automobile towing protection and cargo insurance, which create additional risk exposure for us. When a customer elects to purchase supplemental liability insurance or other optional insurance related products, we typically retain economic exposure to loss, since the insurance is provided by an unaffiliated insurer that is reinsuring its exposure through our captive insurance subsidiary, Constellation Reinsurance Co., Ltd. Additional personal accident insurance offered to our customers in Europe and Australasia is provided by a third-party insurer, and reinsured by our Avis Budget Europe International Reinsurance Limited subsidiary. We also maintain excess insurance coverage through unaffiliated carriers to help mitigate our potential exposure to large liability losses. We otherwise bear these and other risks, except to the extent that the risks are transferred through insurance or contractual arrangements. 
OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We rely primarily on a combination of trademark, trade secret and copyright laws, as well as contractual provisions with employees and third parties, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. The service marks “Avis,” “Budget,” and “Zipcar” and related marks or designs incorporating such terms and related logos and marks such as “We Try Harder,” “We Know The Road” and “Own The Trip, Not The Car” are material to our vehicle rental and car sharing businesses. Our subsidiaries and licensees actively use these marks. All of the material marks used by Avis, Budget and Zipcar are registered (or have applications pending for registration) with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as well as in foreign jurisdictions. Our subsidiaries own the marks and other intellectual property, including the Wizard system, used in our business. We also own trademarks and logos related to the “Apex Car Rentals” brand in Australia and New Zealand, the “Payless Car Rental” brand in the United States and several other countries, the “Maggiore” and “Morini” brands in Italy, the “FranceCars” brand in France and the “Turiscar” brand in Portugal. 
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
At Avis Budget Group, we take our responsibilities as a corporate citizen seriously. We remain aware of how our actions can benefit the community and are sensitive to the needs of the environment, our customers and our employees. We recognize that being a successful organization means our progress is measured not only in economic terms, but also in the many ways we impact the world around us.
We believe in being responsible global corporate citizens and strive to establish and maintain best practices in corporate social responsibility through a focus on:
