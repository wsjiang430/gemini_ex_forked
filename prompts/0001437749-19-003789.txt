ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Overview
 
We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of proprietary prodrugs to treat serious medical conditions through our proprietary Ligand Activated Therapy, or LAT™, technology. We utilize our proprietary LAT technology to generate improved prodrug versions of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as well as to generate prodrug versions of existing compounds that may have applications for new disease indications. Our product candidate pipeline is focused on the high need areas of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, and stimulant use disorder, or SUD. Our co-lead clinical development candidates, KP415 and KP484, are both based on a prodrug of d-methylphenidate, but with differing extended-release, or ER, effect profiles, and are intended for the treatment of ADHD. In addition, we recently announced our commercial partnership with KVK Tech, Inc., or KVK, of APADAZ®, an FDA approved immediate-release, or IR, combination product of benzhydrocodone, our prodrug of hydrocodone, and acetaminophen, or APAP, for the short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.
 
In October 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the License Agreement, with KVK pursuant to which we granted an exclusive license to KVK to conduct regulatory activities for, manufacture and commercialize APADAZ in the United States.
 
Key members of our senior management, while at New River Pharmaceuticals Inc., were instrumental in the development of VYVANSE, a prodrug of amphetamine indicated for ADHD, through FDA marketing approval. New River Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was acquired by Shire plc in 2007 and Vyvanse generated over $3.5 billion in sales in 2018.
 
We employ our proprietary LAT technology to discover and develop prodrugs that are new molecules that can improve one or more of the attributes of approved drugs, such as enhanced bioavailability, extended duration of action, increased safety and reduced susceptibility to abuse. A prodrug is a precursor chemical compound of a drug that is inactive or less than fully active, which is then converted in the body to the active form of the drug through a normal metabolic process. Where possible, we seek, in part, to develop prodrugs that will be eligible for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FFDCA, otherwise known as a 505(b)(2) NDA, which allows us to rely on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for one or more approved products, if we demonstrate such reliance is scientifically appropriate.
 
We intend to advance our pipeline of product candidates for the treatment of ADHD and SUD, and we anticipate submitting a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA for KP415 in the second quarter of 2019. In addition, we anticipate KVK's commercial launch of APADAZ in the second half of 2019. We also anticipate reporting pivotal efficacy trial data and submitting an NDA for KP484 in 2020. We plan to employ our LAT technology and development expertise to develop additional product candidates that address unmet medical needs in large, established markets. We believe our product candidates may be eligible for composition-of-matter patent protection and we intend to use the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway when available, which we believe may reduce drug development time, risk and expense.
 
As of December 31, 2018, our patent portfolio consisted of 155 granted patents and 128 pending patent applications worldwide. Within that patent portfolio, we have received granted U.S. composition-of-matter patents covering benzhydrocodone, our prodrug of hydrocodone, benzhydrocodone-related compositions-of-matter and a composition-of-matter patent that generally covers KP484 and at least one component of KP415.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to be a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel prodrugs. Key components of our strategy include, for example:
 

● | Leverage our proprietary LAT technology to improve the attributes of widely-prescribed, FDA-approved drugs. We plan to employ our proprietary LAT technology to discover and develop prodrugs that can improve one or more of the attributes of FDA-approved drugs that are widely-prescribed. We intend to discover and develop prodrugs of FDA-approved drugs in multiple therapeutic areas.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advance the development of our pipeline product candidates. We plan to advance the development of our co-lead product candidates, KP415 and KP484, for the treatment of ADHD. We plan to report pivotal efficacy trial data for KP484 in 2020. We also plan to submit an NDA for KP415 in 2019 and an NDA for KP484 in 2020. In addition, we are developing KP879, our prodrug of d-methylphenidate, for the treatment of SUD.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to build a global intellectual property portfolio. We intend to vigorously pursue composition-of-matter patent protection for our prodrugs in markets covering a majority of the global commercial opportunity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to evaluate potential partnering opportunities for our ADHD product candidates. We intend to continue to actively evaluate and seek potential partnering opportunities for our ADHD assets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Commercialize APADAZ. In October 2018, we entered into the License Agreement with KVK pursuant to which we granted an exclusive license to KVK to conduct regulatory activities for, manufacture and commercialize APADAZ in the United States. We anticipate that KVK’s commercialization strategy will target outreach to pharmacy benefit managers, managed care organizations and integrated delivery networks for the exclusive utilization of APADAZ as an alternative to currently available hydrocodone/acetaminophen products. We anticipate that KVK may initiate regional pilot launches of APADAZ sales as early as the second half of 2019. We may also license the international commercial rights to APADAZ to one or more collaborators.

Our Proprietary LAT Technology
 
We employ our proprietary LAT technology to create prodrugs that are new molecules by chemically attaching one or more molecules, referred to as ligands, to an FDA-approved parent drug. We typically use ligands that have been demonstrated to be safe in toxicological studies or have been granted Generally Recognized as Safe, or GRAS, status by the FDA. When the prodrug is administered, human metabolic processes, such as those in the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract, separate the ligand from the prodrug and release the parent drug, which can then exert its therapeutic effect. We select ligands that, when combined with the parent drug, create prodrugs believed to have improved drug attributes while maintaining efficacy potentially equivalent to the parent drug.
 
We believe that our proprietary LAT technology offers the following potential benefits:
 

● | Improved drug properties. We seek to discover and develop prodrugs that are new molecules with potentially improved attributes over FDA-approved drugs, such as enhanced bioavailability, extended duration of action, increased safety and reduced susceptibility to abuse.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Composition-of-matter patent protection. Our prodrugs are new molecules and thus may be eligible for patent protection as novel compositions of matter, provided that all other applicable requirements are met. We seek patent protection not only for our product candidates, but also for related compounds with the intention of creating potential heightened barriers to market entry.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Eligibility for 505(b)(2) NDA pathway. Our proprietary LAT technology allows us to discover and develop prodrugs that may be eligible to use the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway. Under that regulatory pathway, if we are able to provide an adequate bridge between our product candidates and appropriate FDA-approved drugs, we will then be able to reference the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness of the approved drugs in our 505(b)(2) NDA submissions. This may allow us to avoid the significant time and expense of conducting large clinical trials and eliminate the need for some preclinical activities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Unmet Need for Addressing Early Morning Behavioral Deficits and Maintaining Consistent, Sustained Efficacy in Daily ADHD Treatment
 
The ADHD market is relatively well served by a number of methylphenidate and amphetamine stimulant products. However, we believe there is a significant need for longer duration products. While many of the currently marketed methylphenidate products provide good symptom control for up to 12 hours post-dose, there is increasing attention to addressing late afternoon/early evening behavioral deficits, while maintaining early symptom control.
 
A study published in a peer-reviewed journal characterized the frequency and severity of ADHD symptoms throughout the day in children and adolescents treated with stable doses of stimulant medications. Results of that particular study indicated that the time from awakening to arriving at school can comprise up to 20% of waking hours per day (2-3 hours), and therefore such symptoms can cause significant distress for both children and caregivers. As a result, we believe there is a need to develop a methylphenidate product that provides early-morning control of symptoms. 
 
In addition to early onset, patients require sustained, consistent efficacy throughout the day and into the early evening hours. While currently marketed methylphenidate products offer efficacy for up to 12 hours, this duration may not be sufficient for all patients. Particularly adolescents and adults may often require longer effects as they have longer waking hours compared to younger patients. It has been reported in a peer-reviewed journal that these patients are typically using dose-augmentation strategies by taking additional doses of stimulant later in the day. We believe a single dose therapy that provides effective symptom control without requiring additional doses may have several benefits including, potentially, improved dosage compliance by regularly and consistently taking medication as indicated, reduced social embarrassment by avoiding the need to take medication during working hours, and overall improvement in quality of life through more consistent therapy. Based on this evidence, we believe there is a need to develop a methylphenidate product that can deliver long duration of efficacy. There may also be a need to develop a long-duration stimulant with and without very early onset depending on individual patient preference and requirements.

Our Product Candidates and Partnered Asset
 
We have employed our proprietary LAT technology to create a portfolio of product candidates that we believe will offer significant improvements over FDA-approved and widely-prescribed drugs. 
 
In February 2018, we announced that the FDA approved the NDA for APADAZ for the short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.
 
In July 2018, we announced top line results from our pivotal efficacy and safety clinical trial of KP415. The trial, also known as KP415.E01 was a multicenter, randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled analog laboratory classroom clinical trial in 150 children aged 6-12 years old with a diagnosis of ADHD to assess the efficacy and safety of KP415. Subjects who received KP415 met the trial’s primary and secondary efficacy endpoint, showing statistically significant improvement on both the Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham, or SKAMP, Scale and the Permanent Product Measure of Performance, or PERMP, scale.
 
In September 2018, we announced top line results from our oral HAP clinical trial of serdexmethylphenidate, or SDX, a prodrug of d-methylphenidate, the major active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in KP415. Results from this oral HAP trial, suggest that the prodrug component of KP415 may have lower abuse potential compared to FOCALIN XR (d-methylphenidate extended release capsules), a schedule II controlled substance approved for the treatment of ADHD, even when SDX is administered at oral doses up to 1.5 times higher than FOCALIN XR on a molar basis. On September 17, 2018, we announced top line results from our intranasal HAP clinical trial of SDX. In this intranasal HAP trial, SDX produced significantly lower scores on the primary endpoint, maximal Drug Liking, and other abuse-related endpoints, compared to intranasal d-methylphenidate hydrochloride, indicating that SDX is not efficiently converted to active d-methylphenidate when snorted.
 
In October 2018, we entered into the License Agreement with KVK pursuant to which we have granted an exclusive license to KVK to conduct regulatory activities for, manufacture and commercialize APADAZ in the United States. Under the terms of the License Agreement we are eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $53.0 million and royalties based on the net profits of APADAZ sales in the United States. We anticipate that KVK’s commercialization strategy will target outreach to pharmacy benefit managers, managed care organizations and integrated delivery networks for the exclusive utilization of APADAZ as an alternative to currently available hydrocodone/acetaminophen products. We anticipate that KVK may initiate regional pilot launches of APADAZ sales as early as the second half of 2019. In support of this anticipated commercial launch, we have begun the technology transfer process outlined under the License Agreement. As part of this process, in February 2019 we completed the transfer of the NDA for APADAZ to KVK.
 
We have also developed a number of product candidates focused on the treatment of pain, in addition to our partnered asset, APADAZ. As of the date of this report, we have chosen to redirect our development efforts to focus on our ADHD and SUD programs, and do not anticipate engaging in substantial development efforts on our pain program during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.
 
Our pipeline of product candidates and our partnered asset are summarized in the table below:

KP415 and KP484
 
Overview
 
The prodrug in KP415 and KP484 is SDX, which we are developing for the treatment of ADHD. The ADHD market is largely served by the stimulant products methylphenidate and amphetamine. KP415 and KP484 are designed to be extended-duration methylphenidate products.
 
We intend to seek approval of KP415 and KP484 under the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway, which will allow us to rely on the FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness for one or more approved products. We anticipate submitting a 505(b)(2) NDA for KP415 in the second quarter of 2019 and reporting additional pharmacokinetic, or PK, and pivotal efficacy trial data and submitting a 505(b)(2) NDA for KP484 in 2020.
 
We are actively evaluating and seeking potential commercial partnership opportunities for KP415 and KP484.
 
We have granted Shire, LLC, or Shire, a right of first refusal to acquire, license or commercialize KP415 and KP484. The right of first refusal may be exercised by Shire for a period of 30 business days following Shire's receipt of written notice from us of the existence of a bona fide offer from a third party to acquire, license or commercialize KP415 or KP484. In early 2019, Shire was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical, or Takeda, and Takeda now holds the right of first refusal.
 
We are also party to an agreement with Aquestive Therapeutics (formerly known as MonoSol Rx, LLC), or Aquestive, pursuant to which Aquestive has the right to receive an amount equal to a percentage in the low teens of any value generated by KP415, KP484 or KP879, and any product candidates arising therefrom, including royalty payments on any license of KP415, KP484 or KP879, the sale of KP415, KP484 or KP879 to a third party or the commercialization of KP415, KP484 or KP879.
 
Market Opportunity
 
We believe the ADHD market would be receptive to new branded drugs that have improved properties when compared to current treatments. We believe a new product in the form of a prodrug that has differentiated features may provide a new treatment option in this large market segment. While methylphenidate is available as a generic product, the branded formulations, including, among others, CONCERTA, FOCALIN XR, QUILLICHEW XR and COTEMPLA XR-ODT, accounted for sales of $1.2 billion in 2018.

Key Features of KP415
 
Based on our preclinical and clinical data, we believe KP415, if approved by the FDA, may have valuable product features and may provide significant benefits to patients, physicians, and society when compared to other FDA-approved and widely-prescribed methylphenidate products:
 

● | Faster early-morning symptom control and sustained effectiveness. In July 2018, we announced top line results from our pivotal efficacy and safety clinical trial of KP415. KP415.E01 was a laboratory classroom clinical trial in children aged 6-12 years old with a diagnosis of ADHD to assess the efficacy and safety of KP415. Subjects who received KP415 met the trial’s primary and secondary efficacy endpoint, showing statistically significant improvement on both the SKAMP and PERMP scales.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced abuse potential. In order to evaluate the potential for reduced abuse of SDX, our prodrug of d-methylphenidate and major component of KP415, we conducted preclinical and clinical studies to compare the exposure to d-methylphenidate following oral, intranasal and intravenous, or IV, administration of the prodrug as compared to oral, intranasal and IV administration of d-methylphenidate hydrochloride. We observed significantly lower concentrations of d-methylphenidate following oral, intranasal and IV administration of the prodrug compared to oral, intranasal and IV administered d-methylphenidate hydrochloride. Consistent with this lower exposure, in human abuse potential studies, we also observed significantly lower abuse-related pharmacodynamic effects compared to d-methylphenidate comparators. Our prodrug of d-methylphenidate incorporates our proprietary LAT technology and, based on our preclinical and clinical studies, we believe it may have lower abuse potential compared to d-methylphenidate.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Once-daily dosing. PK data from our preclinical studies suggest that the time to maximum plasma concentration of d-methylphenidate after oral administration of KP415 is approximately three times longer than that after oral administration of currently marketed IR d-methylphenidate. We believe our PK studies in human subjects also demonstrate that KP415 affords d-methylphenidate concentrations that are consistent with a once-daily, extended-duration product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Amenable to patient-friendly formulations. Our preclinical and clinical data show that KP415 could ultimately be used in a variety of patient-friendly dosage forms such as oral thin film and orally dissolving tablets as a means of increasing patient convenience and dosage compliance by regularly and consistently taking the medication as indicated.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Composition-of-matter patent protection. We have a U.S. composition-of-matter patent that will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible term extensions, in 2032 that generally covers at least one component of KP415. Our patent strategy is focused primarily on key geographic markets, and, as of December 31, 2018, we have composition-of-matter patents in over 50 countries, including in Canada, China, Europe, Malaysia, Mexico, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea and Vietnam, and additional patent filings were pending in the United States and an additional 15 foreign jurisdictions. In addition, subject to further discussions with the FDA, we believe additional patent protection may be eligible for new chemical entity, or NCE, exclusivity status, which could allow for five years of U.S. market exclusivity following the FDA's approval of an NDA for KP415.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No generic equivalent product. KP415 contains a prodrug that was given a new chemical name, serdexmethylphenidate, by the U.S. Adopted Names Council, or USAN, which means that there may be no generic equivalent product for KP415 in most states, making drug-equivalent substitution potentially difficult at the pharmacy.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Features of KP484
 
Based on our preclinical and clinical data, we believe KP484, if approved by the FDA, may have valuable product features and may provide significant benefits to patients, physicians, and society when compared to other FDA-approved and widely-prescribed methylphenidate products:

● | Super-extended release. We believe that this KP484 may provide sustained, consistent effectiveness through the day and into the evening hours.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced abuse potential. The preclinical and clinical studies of SDX, the prodrug of d-methylphenidate, discussed above in the KP415 “Reduced Abuse Potential” subsection are being used by us for the abuse potential evaluation of the KP484 product candidate. Accordingly, we believe serdexmethylphenidate may have attributes that disincentivize certain forms of abuse, as observed in these preclinical and clinical studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Once-daily dosing. PK data from our clinical studies suggest that under fasted conditions, the time to maximum plasma concentration of d-methylphenidate after oral administration of KP484 is potentially five to seven times longer compared to oral administration of currently marketed IR d-methylphenidate. We believe this extended-duration attribute of KP484 may allow for convenient, once-daily dosing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Amenable to patient-friendly formulations. Our preclinical and clinical data shows that KP484 could ultimately be used in a variety of patient-friendly dosage forms such as oral thin film and orally dissolving tablets as a means of increasing patient convenience and dosage compliance by regularly and consistently taking the medications as indicated.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Composition-of-matter patent protection. KP484 is generally protected by a U.S. composition-of-matter patent that will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible term extensions, in 2032. Our patent strategy is focused primarily on key geographic markets, and, as of December 31, 2018, we have composition-of-matter patents generally protecting the major component of KP484 in New Zealand and South Africa.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No generic equivalent product. KP484 contains a prodrug that was given a new chemical name, serdexmethylphenidate, by the USAN, which means that there may be no generic equivalent product for KP484 in most states, making drug-equivalent substitution potentially difficult at the pharmacy.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
KP879
 
KP879, a prodrug of d-methylphenidate using our proprietary LAT technology, is our product candidate for the treatment of SUD including, for example, abuse or misuse of cocaine, methamphetamine and prescription stimulants. Currently there are no approved drugs in the United States for SUD.
 
 10



APADAZ
 
Overview
 
In February 2018, we announced that the FDA approved APADAZ for the short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. APADAZ is an IR combination of our prodrug, benzhydrocodone, and APAP. Benzhydrocodone was developed with our proprietary LAT technology. In October 2018, we entered into the License Agreement with KVK pursuant to which we have granted an exclusive license to KVK to conduct regulatory activities for, manufacture and commercialize APADAZ in the United States. We anticipate that KVK’s commercialization strategy will target outreach to pharmacy benefit managers, managed care organizations and integrated delivery networks for the exclusive utilization of APADAZ as an alternative to currently available hydrocodone/acetaminophen products. We may also license the international commercial rights to APADAZ to one or more collaborators.
 
Market Opportunity
 
Symphony Health estimates that in 2018, IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products represented the most frequently prescribed opioid product in the United States, accounting for 63 million U.S. prescriptions, representing 4.0 billion tablets. Typically, patients are instructed to take 4-6 pills per day and prescriptions provide approximately 14 days of therapy. Hydrocodone is associated with more drug abuse and diversion than any other opioid and IR hydrocodone abuse results in more emergency department visits than any other prescription opioid.
 
Key Product Features of APADAZ
 
We believe APADAZ has many valuable product features and may provide significant benefits to patients, physicians and society when compared to other FDA-approved and widely-prescribed IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products:
 

● | Composition-of-matter patent protection. APADAZ is protected by a U.S. composition-of-matter patent on benzhydrocodone, the prodrug of hydrocodone contained in APADAZ, that will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible patent term extensions, in 2031. Our patent strategy is focused primarily on key geographic markets, and, as of December 31, 2018, benzhydrocodone had received granted, issued or allowed patent status in 21 foreign jurisdictions and patent applications covering benzhydrocodone were pending in an additional 12 foreign jurisdictions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No generic equivalent product. Benzhydrocodone, the APADAZ active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, is a prodrug with a new chemical name given by the USAN, benzhydrocodone. APADAZ has a lower prescribed milligram strength of benzhydrocodone than the therapeutic equivalent amount of hydrocodone bitartrate used in existing IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products. The difference in chemical structure and prescription strength means that there is no generic equivalent product for APADAZ in most states, making substitution difficult at the pharmacy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Convenient dosing. Based on data from our food-effect PK trial, APADAZ can be administered without regard to food and, accordingly, APADAZ will be as convenient as existing IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property strategy includes seeking composition-of-matter patents, among other patents, for our prodrugs and product candidates and conjugates of our prodrugs while also protecting, where appropriate as trade secrets, our proprietary LAT technology, the process by which we identify, screen, evaluate and select ligands to be conjugated with parent drugs to create our prodrugs. Our current prodrugs all consist of an approved parent drug and one or more ligands that we have selected using our proprietary LAT technology. The parent drug and ligand or ligands together may potentially constitute a new molecule and thus may be eligible for composition-of-matter patent protection, among other patent protections, in the United States and abroad.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we have been granted 30 issued patents within the United States, and an additional 87 foreign patents covering our prodrugs or product candidates. The terms of the 30 issued U.S. patents extend to various dates ranging, for example, between 2030 and 2035. The term of our overall domestic and foreign patent portfolio related to our prodrugs and product candidates, including patent term adjustments but excluding possible patent term extensions, extend to various dates ranging, for example, between 2030 and 2035, if pending patent applications in each of our patent families issue as patents. As of December 31, 2018, we had filed 23 pending patent applications under active prosecution in the United States, and an additional 105 pending foreign patent applications potentially covering our prodrugs and product candidates. Our issued and granted patents provide protection in jurisdictions that include the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Cuba, Europe, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Ukraine, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, South Africa and South Korea. 
 
We have received composition-of-matter patents and also additionally filed composition-of-matter patent applications related to the KP415 and KP484 families in the United States and in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, Hong Kong, Europe, India, Israel, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, Ukraine, Vietnam and South Africa. We anticipate filing additional patent applications for our prodrug product candidates.
 
In 2013, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, issued a composition-of-matter patent covering benzhydrocodone, which will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible patent term extensions, no earlier than 2030. Further, there are granted or recently allowed compositions-of-matter patents covering benzhydrocodone in Australia, Belarus, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Cuba, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and Ukraine. In addition, five U.S. patent applications covering benzhydrocodone-related compositions-of-matter were pending as of December 31, 2018, and patent applications covering benzhydrocodone were pending as of December 31, 2018, in the Belarus, Brazil, Costa Rica, Egypt, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Oman, South Korea, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Vietnam.
 
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our LAT technology, as well as any proprietary know-how and show-how beyond that which is patentable, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we generally require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information and, in some cases, requiring disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries, inventions and improvements important to our business.

Commercialization
 
In February 2018, we announced that the FDA approved APADAZ for the short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. 
 
In October 2018, we entered into the License Agreement with KVK pursuant to which we have granted an exclusive license to KVK to conduct regulatory activities for, manufacture and commercialize APADAZ in the United States. Under the terms of the License Agreement we are eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $53.0 million and royalties based on the net profits of APADAZ sales in the United States. We anticipate that KVK’s commercialization strategy will target outreach to pharmacy benefit managers, managed care organizations and integrated delivery networks for the exclusive utilization of APADAZ as an alternative to currently available hydrocodone/acetaminophen products. We anticipate that KVK may initiate regional pilot launches of APADAZ sales as early as the second half of 2019. In support of this anticipated commercial launch, we have begun the technology transfer process outlined under the License Agreement. As part of this process, in February 2019 we completed the transfer of our NDA for APADAZ to KVK. We may also license the international commercial rights to APADAZ to one or more collaborators in the future.
 
With the exception of APADAZ, we have not yet begun commercialization activities for our product candidates in active development. Because many of our product candidates may have large potential market opportunities, and may require significant marketing resources, we may conclude that the most appropriate approach to their commercialization, if they receive regulatory approval, will involve forming a commercial collaboration or strategic relationship, or consummating some type of strategic transaction, with a larger pharmaceutical or other marketing organization. Alternatively, we may conclude that building our own focused sales and marketing organization will be most appropriate, perhaps as part of a co-promotional arrangement, or some other form of collaboration. As we get closer to potential approval of our product candidates, we will work to identify and implement the commercialization strategies that we conclude are the most desirable with regard to the specific product candidates.
 
Research and Development
 
Historically, we have devoted a significant amount of resources to develop our product candidates. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded $41.8 million and $20.6 million, respectively, in research and development expenses. We plan to increase our research and development expense for the foreseeable future as we continue our efforts to further advance the development of our product candidates and commercialize APADAZ and our product candidates, if approved, subject to the availability of additional funding.

Competition
 
Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We will face competition and potential competition from a number of sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our products and product candidates include their potential degree of abuse deterrence, onset of action, bioavailability, therapeutic efficacy, convenience of dosing, safety, tolerability and cost. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as more experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Consequently, our competitors may develop differentiated products for the treatment of ADHD, the short-term management of acute pain, or for other indications we are pursuing or may pursue in the future, and such competitors’ products may be more effective, better tolerated and less costly than our products or product candidates. Our competitors may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products than we are. We will also face competition in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials. 
 
If approved, KP415 and KP484 will compete against currently marketed, branded and generic methylphenidate products for the treatment of ADHD. Some of these currently marketed products include Janssen's Concerta, Novartis AG's RITALIN, Tris' Quillivant, QUILLIVANT XR and QULLICHEW, Novartis' FOCALIN and Focalin XR, UCB S.A.'s METADATE CD, Noven Pharmaceuticals' Daytrana and Neos Therapeutics' Contempla xr-odt, in addition to multiple other branded and generic methylphenidate products marketed by companies including Allergan plc and Mallinckrodt plc. In addition, if approved, KP415 and KP484 will face potential competition from any other methylphenidate products for the treatment of ADHD that are currently in or which may enter into clinical development.
 
Currently, there are no approved drugs in the United States for the treatment of SUD. If approved, KP879 will face potential competition from any products for the treatment of SUD that are currently in or which may enter into clinical development.
 
APADAZ will compete against currently marketed, branded and generic IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products indicated for the short-term management of acute pain. Some of these currently marketed products include AbbVie's VICODIN, Allergan's NORCO, Shionogi's XODOL and UCB Pharma's LORTAB, in addition to multiple other branded and generic hydrocodone/APAP combination products marketed by companies including Allergan plc, Endo International plc and Mallinckrodt plc. In addition, APADAZ will face potential competition from any IR or hydrocodone/APAP combination products for the short-term management of acute pain that are currently in or may enter into clinical development.

Manufacturing
 
Our manufacturing strategy is to rely on contract manufacturers to produce our product candidates for clinical trials and, if approved, drug product for commercial sale. We currently have no manufacturing facilities and limited personnel with manufacturing experience. We rely on Johnson Matthey Inc., or JMI, a third-party manufacturer, to produce the bulk quantities of benzhydrocodone required to manufacture APADAZ under a supply agreement. We have contracted with another third-party manufacturer to supply KP415 and KP484 to be used in our non-clinical, clinical and formulation development programs necessary to support an NDA filing. We plan to continue to rely on these manufacturers to manufacture commercial quantities of APADAZ, KP415 and KP484, respectively, for sale in the United States, if and when we receive approval by the FDA. We expect to contract with third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of all API supply needs outside the United States if and when we receive approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States.
 
Our current and any future third-party manufacturers, their facilities and all lots of drug substance and drug products used in our clinical trials are required to be in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements and FDA satisfaction before any product is approved and we can manufacture commercial products. Our current and any future third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.
 
Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, refusals of government contracts and new orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and individual imprisonments.
 
Supply Agreement with Johnson Matthey
 
Under our supply agreement with JMI, or the Supply Agreement, JMI has agreed to supply us with all of the benzhydrocodone necessary for clinical trials and commercial sale for a price equal to JMI’s manufacturing cost and to provide process development services for benzhydrocodone. In exchange, we issued shares of our common stock to JMI, provided that the commercial supply arrangement for benzhydrocodone would be exclusive to them in the United States. In addition, for further process optimization and manufacture of NDA registration batches, we agreed to pay a minimum royalty on the net sales on the commercial sale of any products which utilize benzhydrocodone as the API. The percentage royalty rate ranges from the high teens at low volumes to the mid-single digits at higher volumes. Under the agreement, JMI has completed manufacture of our registration batches of any products which utilize benzhydrocodone as the API, and stability testing for those batches is in process.
 
Under the Supply Agreement, we retain sole ownership of benzhydrocodone and are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and to pursue FDA marketing approval of any products which utilize benzhydrocodone as the API. We are responsible for product development, including formulation, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and for regulatory approval, quality assurance and commercialization. If any products which utilize benzhydrocodone as the API are subject to a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, scheduling quota, then each year, both we and JMI are responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a quota from the DEA for the production of benzhydrocodone for use with any products that utilize benzhydrocodone as an API.
 
JMI is responsible for all costs of any benzhydrocodone manufactured during a specified validation process for any products which utilize benzhydrocodone as an API. After completion of the validation process, but prior to the commercial launch of any products that utilize benzhydrocodone as the API, JMI will manufacture batches of benzhydrocodone at a negotiated price. Upon commercial launch, JMI will manufacture and supply benzhydrocodone at a price equal to JMI’s fully allocated manufacturing cost after commercial launch of APADAZ or any other product that may utilize benzhydrocodone as an API, should we obtain approval for marketing from the FDA.
 
We must purchase all of our U.S. benzhydrocodone needs from JMI and JMI cannot supply benzhydrocodone to other companies. After the commercial launch of any product that utilizes benzhydrocodone as the API, JMI is required to identify a secondary manufacturing site and qualify and validate that site for the production of benzhydrocodone.
 
The term of the Supply Agreement extends as long as we hold a valid and enforceable patent for benzhydrocodone or until the tenth anniversary of the commercial launch of any product that utilizes benzhydrocodone as the API, whichever date is later. Upon the expiration of such term, the agreement will automatically renew for a period of two years unless either party provides 12 months’ prior notice of its intent not to renew.
 
Asset Purchase Agreement with Shire
 
In March 2012, as a result of a litigation settlement, we and our chief executive officer, Travis C. Mickle, Ph. D., entered into an asset purchase agreement with Shire pursuant to which we sold assets and intellectual property to Shire for proceeds of $5.1 million. Pursuant to this agreement, we also granted Shire a right of first refusal to acquire, license or commercialize KP415 and KP484. In early 2019, Shire was acquired by Takeda, and Takeda now holds this right of first refusal.

Third-Party Reimbursement
 
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, such as state and federal governmental authorities, including those that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and private managed care organizations and health insurers. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for each of our product and product candidates will be made on a plan-by-plan basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Each third-party payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a drug, what amount it will pay providers for the drug, and on what tier of its formulary the drug will be placed. These decisions are influenced by the existence of multiple drug products within a therapeutic class and the net cost to the plan, including the amount of the prescription price, if any, rebated by the drug’s manufacturer. Typically, generic versions of drugs are placed in a preferred tier. The position of a drug on the formulary generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the drug and can strongly influence the adoption of a drug by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Also, third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. As a result, coverage, reimbursement and placement determinations are complex and are often the subject of extensive negotiations between the payor and the owner of the drug.
 
Unless we enter into a strategic collaboration under which our collaborator assumes responsibility for seeking coverage and reimbursement for a given product, we will be responsible for negotiating coverage, reimbursement and placement decisions for our product candidates. Coverage, reimbursements and placement decisions for a new product are based on many factors including the coverage, reimbursement and placement of already marketed branded drugs for the same or similar indications, the safety and efficacy of the new product, availability of generics for similar indications, the clinical need for the new product and the cost-effectiveness of the product. Increasingly, both purchasers and payors are also conducting comparative clinical and cost effectiveness analyses involving application of metrics, including data on patient outcomes, provided by manufacturers.
 
Within the Medicare program, as self-administered drugs, our product and product candidates would be reimbursed under the expanded prescription drug benefit known as Medicare Part D. This program is a voluntary Medicare benefit administered by private plans that operate under contracts with the federal government. These plans develop formularies that determine which products are covered and what co-pay will apply to covered drugs. The plans have considerable discretion in establishing formularies and tiered co-pay structures, negotiating rebates with manufacturers and placing prior authorization and other restrictions on the utilization of specific products, subject to review by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, for discriminatory practices. These Part D plans negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers, which are passed on, in whole or in part, to each of the plan’s enrollees through reduced premiums. Historically, Part D beneficiaries have been exposed to significant out-of-pocket costs after they surpass an annual coverage limit and until they reach a catastrophic coverage threshold. However, changes made by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act, or the ACA, will reduce this patient coverage gap, known as the “donut hole”, by transitioning patient responsibility in that coverage range from 100% in 2010 to only 25% in 2019. To help achieve this reduction, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide quarterly discounts of 50%, and 70% commencing January 1, 2019, off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the donut hole.
 
If a drug product is available for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid, its manufacturer must comply with various health regulatory requirements and price reporting metrics, which may include, as applicable, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, or the OBRA, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or the VHCA, each as amended. Among other things, the OBRA requires drug manufacturers with certain drugs covered by Medicaid to pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs. States may also negotiate “supplemental” Medicaid rebates on drug products dispensed under Medicaid. Manufacturers participating in Medicaid are also generally required to participate in the Public Health Service 340B Drug Discount Program, which imposes a mandatory discount on purchases by certain customers. Manufacturers of innovator drugs, including 505(b)(2) drugs, that participate in the Medicaid program are also required to offer the drugs on the Federal Supply Schedule purchasing program of the General Services Administration for purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and other authorized users at a mandatory discount. Additional laws and requirements apply to these contracts. Participation in such federal programs may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. 
 
Third-party payors, including the U.S. government, continue to apply downward pressure on the reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Also, the trend towards managed health care in the United States and the concurrent growth of organizations such as health maintenance organizations may result in lower reimbursement for pharmaceutical products. We expect that these trends will continue as these payors implement various proposals or regulatory policies, including various provisions of the recent health reform legislation that affect reimbursement of these products. There are currently, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement controls on reimbursement and pricing, directly and indirectly.

Government Regulation
 
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, packaging, recordkeeping, tracking, approval, import, export, distribution, advertising and promotion of our products.
 
The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | non-clinical laboratory and animal tests that must be conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices, or GLPs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must be received by the FDA and become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each clinical site or centrally before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for its intended use, performed in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission of a NDA to the FDA;
--+--------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with cGMP and GCPs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Prior to the commencement of marketing of controlled substances, the DEA must also determine the controlled substance schedule, taking into account the recommendation of the FDA.
 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of drug substance chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and drug product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Prior to commencing the first human clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit the results of the preclinical tests and preclinical literature, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Additional non-clinical studies may be required even after the IND is submitted. The IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial by imposing a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, as well as amendments to previously submitted clinical trials. Further, an independent IRB for each study site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, its informed consent form and other communications to study subjects before the clinical trial commences at that site. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted, including any changes to the study plans. Regulatory authorities, an IRB or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA’s or the IRB’s requirements, if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects, or based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate. Some studies also include a data safety monitoring board, which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may advise us to halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. 
 
 17



In general, for purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
 

● | Phase 1—Studies are initially conducted to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy volunteers or subjects with the target disease or condition. If possible, Phase 1 trials may also be used to gain an initial indication of product effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2—Controlled studies are conducted with groups of subjects with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3—These clinical trials are undertaken in larger subject populations to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded subject population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may be done globally to support global registrations so long as the global sites are also representative of the U.S. population and the conduct of the study at global sites comports with FDA regulations and guidance, such as compliance with GCPs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the case of a 505(b)(2) NDA, some of the above-described studies and preclinical studies may not be required or may be abbreviated. Bridging studies may be needed, however, to demonstrate the relevance of the studies that were previously conducted by other sponsors to the drug that is the subject of the NDA.
 
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4, or post-market, studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information.
 
Clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which includes the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, and the review and approval of the study by an IRB. Investigators must also provide information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make specified financial disclosures to the FDA. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated and a statistical analysis plan. Information about some clinical trials, including a description of the trial and trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FFDCA. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events occur.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 
505(b)(2) Approval Process
 
Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA, provides an alternate regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the reference listed drug for purposes of a 505(b)(2) NDA. The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes from the reference listed drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
Our current and anticipated product candidates are or will be based on already approved APIs in combination with a ligand. Accordingly, we have and expect to be able to continue to rely on information from studies previously conducted by the companies that obtained approval for drugs containing such APIs.

Orange Book Listing
 
Section 505 of the FFDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical and clinical data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.
 
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. These products may be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.
 
Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug or method of use that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV certification. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, or, if permissible, are carved out.
 
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the reference listed drug and the patent owner once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification prevents the FDA from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a Paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation. The applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. 
 
Exclusivity
 
The FDA provides periods of regulatory exclusivity, which provides the holder of an approved NDA limited protection from new competition in the marketplace for the innovation represented by its approved drug for a period of three or five years following the FDA’s approval of the NDA. Five years of exclusivity are available to NCEs. An NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt, including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds, or other noncovalent derivatives, such as a complex, chelate, or clathrate, of the molecule, responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review or approve an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application, however, may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. Applicants may also seek to carve out certain drug labeling that is protected by exclusivity.
 
If a product is not eligible for the NCE exclusivity, it may be eligible for three years of exclusivity. Three-year exclusivity is available to the holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical trials, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence trials, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity period protects against FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for the condition of the new drug’s approval. As a general matter, three-year exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.

NDA Submission and Review by the FDA
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical and preclinical testing, among other items, the results of product development, including chemistry, manufacture and controls, non-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA, along with proposed labeling, as part of an NDA. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA. These user fees must be filed at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in some circumstances. One basis for a waiver of the application user fee is if the applicant employs fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, the applicant does not have an approved marketing application for a product that has been introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, and the applicant, including its affiliates, is submitting its first marketing application.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 
The FDA must refer applications for drugs that contain active ingredients, including any ester or salt of the active ingredients, that have not previously been approved by the FDA to an advisory committee or provide in an action letter a summary of the reasons for not referring it to an advisory committee. The FDA may also refer drugs which present difficult questions of safety, purity or potency to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel that typically includes clinicians and other experts who review, evaluate and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities, including contract manufacturers and subcontracts, are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
 
Once the FDA receives an application, it has 60 days to review the NDA to determine if it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review, before it accepts the application for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. The timeline for the FDA to complete its review of a NDA may differ based on whether the application is a standard review or priority review application. The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has set the review goal of ten months from the 60-day filing date to complete its initial review of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity, or NME, and make a decision on the application. For non-NME standard applications, the FDA has set the review goal of ten months from the submission date to complete its initial review and to make a decision on the application. For priority review applications, the FDA has set the review goal of reviewing NME NDAs within six months of the 60-day filing date and non-NME applications within six months of the submission date. Such deadlines are referred to as the PDUFA date. The PDUFA date is only a goal and the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates. The review process and the PDUFA date may also be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding the submission.
 
Once the FDA’s review of the application is complete, the FDA will issue either a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, or approval letter. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing, or other information or analyses in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The FDA has the goal of reviewing 90% of application resubmissions in either two or six months of the resubmission date, depending on the kind of resubmission (Class 1 or Class 2). Even with the submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 
The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms. For example, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, as a condition of approval or following approval to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks and ensure safe use of the drug. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product, or impose additional post-marketing requirements, based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements, FDA notification and FDA review and approval. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling or FDA notification may be required.
 
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed or may include contraindications, warnings or precautions in the product labeling, including a boxed warning. If the FDA requires a boxed warning, we would also be subject to specified promotional restrictions, such as the prohibition of reminder advertisements. The FDA also may not approve the inclusion of labeling claims necessary for successful marketing. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 
 20



Post-approval Requirements
 
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including manufacturing, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising, promotion, drug shortage reporting, compliance with any post-approval requirements imposed as a conditional of approval such as Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS and surveillance, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, including adverse experiences.
 
After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual human prescription drug program fee requirements for approved products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and to list their drug products, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements, which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements.
 
Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented, or FDA notification. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and specifications and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in withdrawal of marketing approval, mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information or other limitations, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program, among other consequences.
 
The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA. Physicians, in their independent professional medical judgment, may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. We, however, are prohibited from marketing or promoting drugs for uses outside of the approved labeling.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products, including samples, is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act also imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing.
 
Failure to comply with any of the FDA’s requirements could result in significant adverse enforcement actions. These include a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, refusals of government contracts and new orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and individual imprisonment. Any of these sanctions could result in adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences.
 
 21



Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy
 
The FDA has the authority to require a REMS to ensure the safe use of the drug. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecule. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must develop the REMS program, which the FDA reviews and approves. A REMS may be required for a single drug or an entire class of drugs.
 
A REMS may be required to include various elements, including, but not limited to, a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, elements to assure safe use, or ETASU, an implementation system, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under specified circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.
 
Based upon currently approved product REMS programs and class-wide REMS programs, including the class-wide REMS programs for extended-release and long-acting opioid analgesics, we believe that any opioid product candidates we may choose to develop in the future, if approved, may be subject to a REMS. Accordingly, we expect to have to take prescribed measures to ensure the safe use of these product candidates, if any, that may be approved. For example, in September 2018, the FDA approved the Opioid Analgesic REMS for extended-release, long-acting, or ER/LA, and IR opioids as one strategy among multiple national and state efforts to reduce the risk of abuse, misuse, addiction, overdose and deaths due to prescription opioid analgesics which APADAZ is subject to. In accordance with the License Agreement, KVK is responsible for regulatory activities for APADAZ in the United States, including, the REMS program.
 
 22



DEA Regulation
 
Most of our products and product candidates, if approved, will be regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and the DEA’s implementing regulations, which establish registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation, inventory, quota and other requirements administered by the DEA. These requirements are directly applicable to us and also applicable to our contract manufacturers and to distributors, prescribers and dispensers of our product candidates. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.
 
The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule II drugs are those that meet the following criteria:
 

● | the drug has a high potential for abuse;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | the drug has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | abuse of the drug may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The DEA has determined that APADAZ will be listed as a Schedule II controlled substance under the CSA, and we expect that most of our other products and product candidates may be listed in the same manner, if approved. In 2014, the DEA rescheduled hydrocodone combination products into Schedule II from Schedule III. If our product candidates are ultimately listed as Schedule II controlled substances, then the importation of APIs for our product candidates, as well as the manufacture, shipping, storage, sales and use of the products, will be subject to a high degree of regulation. In addition to maintaining an importer and/or exporter registration, importers and exporters of controlled substances must obtain a permit for every import of a Schedule I or II substance and a narcotic substance in Schedule III, IV and V, as well as every export of a Schedule I or II substance and a narcotic substance in Schedule III and IV. For all other drugs in Schedule III, IV and V, importers and exporters must submit an import or export declaration. Schedule II drugs are subject to the strictest requirements for registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting. Also, distribution and dispensing of these drugs are highly regulated. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription. Electronic prescriptions may also be permissible depending on the state, so long as the prescription complies with the DEA’s requirements for electronic prescriptions.
 
Controlled substances classified in Schedule III, IV, and V are also subject to registration, recordkeeping, reporting, and security requirements. For example, Schedule III drug prescriptions must be authorized by a physician and may not be refilled more than six months after the date of the original prescription or more than five times. A prescription for controlled substances classified in Schedules III, IV, and V issued by a physician, may be communicated either orally, in writing or by facsimile to the pharmacies. Controlled substances that are also classified as narcotics, such as hydrocodone, oxycodone and hydromorphone, are also subject to additional DEA requirements, such as manufacturer reporting of the import of narcotic raw material.
 
Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. Similarly, separate registrations are also required for separate facilities. Acquisition and distribution transactions must also be reported for Schedule I and II controlled substances, as well as Schedule III narcotic substances.
 
The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration and on a periodic basis. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special permits and notification requirements apply to imports and exports of narcotic drugs. To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.
 
In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance or Schedule III narcotic must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. Because most of our current product candidates may be regulated as Schedule II controlled substances, they may be subject to the DEA’s production and procurement quota scheme. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much of a controlled substance may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The limited aggregate amount of stimulants that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, which must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We and our contract manufacturers must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure any Schedule I or Schedule II substances for use in manufacturing of our product candidates. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay, limitation or refusal by the DEA in establishing our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. 
 
Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products, including, for example, state requirements for licensures or registration.

Other Healthcare Regulations
 
Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, promotion, distribution, medical education and other activities are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and its various divisions, including the CMS and the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and state and local governments. Our business activities must comply with numerous healthcare laws, including those described below.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, the referral of an individual for, or purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of, any good, facility, item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the ACA amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some other healthcare criminal fraud statutes, so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have violated those statutes. The ACA also provided that a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is grounds for the government or a whistleblower to assert that a claim for payment of items or services resulting from such violation constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
 
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Additionally, the ACA amended the intent requirement of some of these criminal statutes under HIPAA so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have committed a violation.
 
Additionally, the federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the ACA and its implementing regulations, require some manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with specified exceptions) to report annually information related to specified payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually specified ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 
Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in significant civil monetary penalties.
 
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain individually identifiable health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Many states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. Several states and local jurisdictions have also enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, or register their sales representatives, as well as prohibiting pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices.
 
Depending on the circumstances, failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties, including criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, debarment from government contracts, individual imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion from government programs, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business.

Healthcare Reform Measures
 
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 
For example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed. The ACA has substantially changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for specified branded prescription drugs, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, expanded health care fraud and abuse laws, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, imposed an inflation penalty on new formulations of drugs, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, expanded the 340B program which caps the price at which manufacturers can sell covered outpatient pharmaceuticals to specified hospitals, clinics and community health centers, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research. There have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA has on our business. Final regulations, guidance, amendments and judicial orders are anticipated in the future and we will continue to assess the ACA’s impact on us as final regulations, guidance, amendments and judicial orders are issued.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, in January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 
Further, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the companies, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 33 full-time employees. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
