 Recent Developments
Acquisition of MPH Medical Devices S.R.O.
On August 11, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of MPH Medical Devices S.R.O. ("MPH"), a Czech Republic-based manufacturer of medical consumables with plastics specialization in making disposable tube-set-like products, for a total purchase price of €21.8 million ($22.4 million), net of cash acquired. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility and cash available on hand. The addition of MPH has expanded the Company's manufacturing capacity and capabilities in medical disposable tube set products within the Vision reportable segment.
Business Environment
 COVID-19 Pandemic
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took proactive actions and incurred additional costs to protect the health and safety of our employees, including investments in technologies and monitoring equipment, testing employees for COVID-19 at certain locations and rearranging some of our facilities to accommodate social distancing and flexible post-pandemic work environment. These costs were not material in 2022.
Although COVID-19 restrictions have been relaxed in the U.S. and Europe, in response to outbreaks of infection in various locations within China, local governmental authorities continued to implement lockdown orders in some areas during 2022, significantly slowing economic and business activities. Our manufacturing and distribution operations in China have been impacted by these lockdowns.
 There continue to be isolated COVID-19 outbreaks in certain regions of the world, but these outbreaks have not had a significant impact on our operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations in 2023 and beyond remains uncertain and unpredictable. For further discussion on the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, herein.
Global Supply Chain Disruptions
 Over the past three years, we experienced disruptions to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and global electronics and other raw material shortages. While we regularly monitor the manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain, disruptions to our suppliers and/or sub-suppliers could further challenge our ability to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations and customer relationships. To mitigate the risk of supply interruptions, we are identifying alternative suppliers and distributors, sourcing raw materials from different supplier and distributor locations, modifying our product designs to allow for alternative components to be used without compromising product quality and performance, in-sourcing production of parts where feasible, and taking other actions to ensure a sustainable supply of raw materials. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and backlogs, and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays for obtaining raw materials from suppliers. Our supply chain disruptions and customer orders to secure supply have caused significantly elevated customer backlog levels. As of December 31, 2022, our backlog was almost

double our average pre-COVID backlog levels because of longer customer order lead times. We anticipate that our customers will gradually shorten their order lead times as supply chain disruptions ease over time in the near future.
Inflationary Pressures
 The COVID-19 pandemic and the global supply chain disruptions have caused inflationary pressures on the market prices for raw materials and components as well as increases in the costs of labor. Price increases were on average more than double the 2021 price increases for certain key raw materials and components. Similarly, the overall low unemployment rate and the competition for available talents resulted in average annual wage increases more than doubling 2021 average annual wage increases. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity and cost reduction initiatives, as well as increasing our selling prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers. However, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover the increases in our costs. Additionally, the inflationary pressures have given rise to significant increases in interest rates as various governments used monetary policy to reduce inflation. As a result, our weighted average interest rate increased from approximately 2.3% as of December 31, 2021 to approximately 5.1% as of December 31, 2022.
Russia Ukraine Conflict
 In February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. In response, the U.S., the European Union (“EU”), and several other countries imposed economic and trade sanctions and other restrictions (collectively, “global sanctions”) targeting Russia and Belarus. Russia then imposed retaliatory economic measures against the U.S., the EU, and several other countries. Our sales to Russia have not been material. We also do not have any assets, employees or third-party contractors in Russia or Ukraine. The duration of the conflict and further sanctions could have further impact on the global economy and inflation. Due to the uncertainty around the duration of the conflict, these longer-term factors are unknown to our business.
 Acquisitions
We continuously evaluate our business mix and financial performance. Since 2013, we have executed a series of acquisitions in line with our strategy. The following table summarizes significant acquisitions since 2013:

End Markets
 We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market.
Medical Market
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the medical market accounted for approximately 49% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in

technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends.
Advanced Industrial Market
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 51% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers' Index on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market.
Customers
We have a diverse group of customers that includes companies that are global leaders in the medical and advanced industrial markets. Many of our customers participate in several market industries. No customer accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized revenue from an OEM customer in the medical end market which accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated revenue.
 Our customers include many OEMs who integrate our products into their systems for sale to end users. A typical OEM customer will usually evaluate our products and our ability to provide application knowledge and expertise, post-sales application support and services, supply chain management over long durations, manufacturing capabilities, product quality, global presence, and product customization before deciding to incorporate our products into their products or systems. Customers generally choose suppliers based on several factors, including product performance, reliability, application support, price, breadth of the supplier’s product offerings, the financial condition of the supplier, and the geographical coverage offered by the supplier. Once certain products have been designed into a given OEM customer’s product or system, there are generally significant barriers to subsequent supplier changes until the end of the product or system life cycle, especially in the medical market.
Seasonality
While our revenues are not highly seasonal on a consolidated basis, the revenues of some of our individual product lines are impacted in the first quarter by the lower seasonal spending patterns of our customers due to their annual capital budgeting cycles.
 Backlog
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our consolidated backlog was approximately $611.6 million and $568.8 million, respectively. Most orders included in backlog represent open orders for products and services that, based on management’s projections, have a reasonable probability of being delivered over the subsequent twelve months. The ability to reschedule orders included in backlog varies depending on the customer and order. Management believes that backlog typically is not a complete indicator of future business prospects for any of our business segments due to the ability of customers to reschedule orders based on their updated demand and timing requirements, the potential fluctuations in our supply chain and manufacturing capacity. Therefore, backlog as of any date should not be relied upon as a complete indicator of our revenues for any future period. During 2022, we continued to experience longer than normal lead times for our customer orders, caused by higher customer demand and unprecedented raw materials shortages and supply chain disruptions caused by both the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic and geopolitical factors.
 Manufacturing
Manufacturing functions are performed internally either when we choose to maintain control over critical portions of the production process, or for cost-related reasons, while other portions of the manufacture of our products are outsourced to highly qualified third parties.
Products offered by our Photonics segment are manufactured at facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts; Mukilteo, Washington; Taunton and Manchester, United Kingdom; and Suzhou, China. Products offered by our Vision segment are manufactured at facilities in Syracuse, New York; Mukilteo, Washington; Přelouč, Czech Republic; and Ludwigsstadt, Germany. Products offered by our Precision Motion segment are manufactured at facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts; Apex, North Carolina; Marlborough, Connecticut; Rocklin, California; and Suzhou, China.

The majority of our products are produced in manufacturing facilities certified under ISO 9001 certification, while most of our products manufactured for the medical market are produced in factories under ISO 13485 certification. The majority of our manufacturing facilities are also ISO 14001 certified. Certain visualization solutions, thermal chart recorders, imaging informatics, and medical insufflators, pumps, disposables, and accessories products are manufactured under current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs), which is a requirement of their medical device classification by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”).
 Marketing, Sales and Distribution
We sell our products globally, primarily through our direct sales force. We also use distributors, including manufacturers’ representatives, to either augment our selling effort or serve a local market where we have no direct sales force. Our local sales, applications, and service teams and our distributors work closely with our customers to ensure customer satisfaction with our products. We have sales and service centers located in the United States, Europe and Asia.
To support our sales efforts, we maintain and continue to invest in a number of application centers around the world, where our application experts work closely with customers on integrating and using our solutions in their equipment. We currently maintain service and application centers in the United States, Europe and Asia.
 Competition
We encounter aggressive and strong competition in virtually all the markets, applications, and technologies we serve. Due to the wide and diverse range of products and technologies, we face many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to small organizations producing a limited number of highly specialized products or services for specialized applications. The competitive climate of many of the end market applications we serve are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and customer demands that require continuing investments by us. Our competitive success requires advances in technology and product performance, improved price-for-performance ratios, demonstrated increased throughput performance for our customers' products, lower total cost of ownership, product quality, depth of our application knowledge and expertise, reputation amongst customers, customer service and technical support, speed to market, geographical presence, and deep customer relationships.
We believe that our products offer several competitive advantages for our customers, and the breadth of the technologies we offer gives us deep applications knowledge to better serve our customers’ needs.
 Raw Materials, Components and Supplies
Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, components and parts that are generally available from alternative sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. In some instances, we are able to design and/or re-engineer the parts and components used in our products in case of supply chain shortages. For certain raw materials, components and parts used in the production of some of our principal products, we have identified only a limited number of suppliers or, in some instances, a single source of supply. We also rely on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture subassemblies for some of our products.
For a further discussion of the importance and risks associated with our supply chain, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Patents and Intellectual Property
We rely upon a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We hold several registered and pending patents in the United States and other countries. In addition, we also have trademarks registered in the United States and other countries. We will continue to actively pursue applications for new patents and trademarks as we deem appropriate. However, there can be no assurance that any other patents will be issued to us or that such patents, if and when issued, will provide any protection or benefit to us.
Although we believe that our patents and pending patent applications are important, we rely upon several additional factors that are essential to our business success, including: market position, technological innovation, know-how, application knowledge and product performance. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain these advantages. Considering the diversified nature of our businesses, we do not believe that any individual patent is material to our business as a whole.


We also protect our proprietary rights by controlling access to our proprietary information and by maintaining confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and certain customers and suppliers. For a further discussion of the importance of risks associated with our intellectual property rights, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Human Capital
 We believe that our employees are our most important asset. The Chief Human Resources Officer (“CHRO”) is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. This includes the acquisition, development, and retention of talent to deliver on our strategy as well as the design of employee compensation and benefits, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives. The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the CHRO regularly update our board of directors on the operation and status of these human capital activities, including, but not limited to, talent management, talent development, and succession planning. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 3,000 people, of which approximately 44% were in the United States, 46% in Europe, and 10% in Asia. We win with our customers by delivering new technology innovations through our engineering teams of approximately 600 employees.
 We believe that our employees have a meaningful role in helping us develop our culture. We utilize survey feedback mechanisms to measure employee engagement and organizational health. This enables us to gain insight into our current status and into areas where we can improve. We have conducted surveys of our entire employee population in each of last four years and we compare our employee engagement and organizational health scores against benchmark populations with our survey vendors. Our employee satisfaction score in 2022 was 90% of the benchmark score. This is an improvement of 3 percentage points compared with 2021. Following each survey cycle, we review the results with our teams across the company and develop specific action plans based on the feedback we receive. We execute on our action plans with the goal of improving our overall organizational health and employee engagement.
 All employees are responsible for upholding the Novanta Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which is important in delivering on our strategy. We maintain a compliance hotline for the confidential reporting of any suspected policy violations or unethical business conduct on the part of our businesses, employees, officers, directors, suppliers or customers. We provide training and education to our global workforce with respect to our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies, data privacy regulations and workplace harassment on an annual basis.
 Diversity and Inclusion
 The Novanta Way defines our performance culture and begins with building cohesive teams based on trust, commitment, and accountability. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are an important part of our culture and will be leader led and embedded into our ways of working. Our aim is to reflect diversity in our governance, leadership, influence, and technical expertise at all levels in the organization. Our policy is to not tolerate discrimination and harassment. We expect our teams to respect our core values and conduct themselves ethically at all times in accordance with the Novanta Code of Ethics and Business Conduct.
As of December 31, 2022, our board of directors was 50% comprised of men and 50% comprised of women. Women representation on our board of directors increased 17 percentage points in 2022 from 2021. Individuals from underrepresented groups (defined as individuals who self-identify as Black, African American, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, Native American, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or two or more races or ethnicities) remained at 11% representation of our board of directors as of December 31, 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, our gender diversification efforts resulted in 40% of our workforce being women, which was an increase of 4 percentage points in women representation on our workforce from December 31, 2021. The proportion of women in management positions amounted to 25%, which is consistent with the prior year. Employees from underrepresented groups represented 45% of our U.S. based workforce as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 3 percentage points compared to 2021.
 During 2022, our DEI roadmap included a series of strategic initiatives designed to help further diversify our workforce, by connecting with women and underrepresented candidate populations and measuring our recruiting activities to ensure that women and underrepresented candidates are present in our final interview slates by more than 55%, while fostering an inclusive culture and promoting lifelong learning as a part of our work towards cultural transformation. As a result of these initiatives, we increased our representation of women within the Company. We also increased the proportion of employees from underrepresented groups across our U.S. workforce, both among individual employees and in leadership positions.
Our Culture Council launched one more Employee Resource Group ("ERG") with the goal of increasing employees’ sense of inclusion and belonging. We now have three employee-led ERGs:
 •Multicultural & International ERG


•Women’s ERG
 •Novanta Professionals Network ERG
 Additionally, our Localization and Development team collaborated with our business units on NovantaCARES, our voluntary community outreach program to promote greater equity within marginalized and underserved communities and to protect the environment. Our Learning and Development team facilitated live peer-to-peer DEI educational programs to promote greater understanding of the benefits of diversity and inclusion.
Compensation and Benefits
 We strive to provide market competitive compensation, benefits and services that help meet the varying needs of our employees. In addition to salaries and wages, these programs, which vary by country, can include annual bonuses, sales commissions, stock-based compensation awards, defined contribution retirement savings plans with company matching contributions, healthcare and other insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, health savings account with company matching contributions, paid time off, paid family leave, and tuition assistance. Certain U.S. facilities have a dedicated medical professional on site to provide basic healthcare services to employees, provide general first aid, assess employee health risks and promote employee health. Additionally, all U.S. employees and their families have access to video and telephonic Telemedicine support seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day. Our bonus and commission payment programs allow for higher payouts when goals are exceeded and lower payouts when goals are not achieved as planned.
Growth and Development
 We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Novanta an employer of choice. In certain countries, we offer college tuition reimbursement for eligible employees for undergraduate and graduate studies. In 2019, we founded Novanta University as a primary instrument of company-wide learning management that includes both internal and external training courses. We leverage the Novanta University processes and learning content to ensure all new employees have a common and complete onboarding experience. Our people leaders, with the support of our human resources organization, are accountable for ensuring the onboarding process is complete and effective. In addition to Novanta University, we utilize our Novanta Growth System, which provides processes, tools, and trainings with a focus on continuous improvement. In 2022, further investment was made in leadership development and diversity, equity, and inclusion. Approximately 90% of our top leaders successfully completed our global coaching and leadership development program which included the completion of Individual Development Plans ("IDPs"). Additionally, we launched Leadership Development for Front-Line Leaders, a leadership development program targeting front-line and mid-level leaders. We also hosted numerous DEI educational events throughout the year. This included providing Unconscious Bias voluntary training to over 80% of our professional employees, Inclusive Leadership Masterclasses for our people leaders, and Culture Mapping training for all of our employees around the globe.
NovantaCARES - Voluntary Community Support
 We provide every employee with one paid day-off per year to volunteer at non-profit organizations supporting social charities or the environment. We had set a Novanta-wide goal of sponsoring 250 community service days by the end of 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we surpassed the goal with 314 community service days.
Safety and Wellbeing of Our Employees
 We provide mandatory safety trainings in our facilities, which are designed to focus on empowering our employees with the knowledge and tools they need to make safe choices and to mitigate risks. In further support of our employees, we maintained and promoted our global health and wellness resource center, “NovantaWELL”. The resource center provides a central information hub for all employees, with country-specific information, on physical and mental health and wellness.
Cybersecurity
 In the normal course of business, we may collect and store confidential and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business information, trade secrets, intellectual property, sensitive third-party information, and employee information. To protect this information, we have developed and implemented continuous monitoring and detection programs, multi-layer defense architecture, encryption of critical data, and comprehensive security assessments protocols. Our cybersecurity program enables us to assess and mitigate cybersecurity risks (threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts) with customized measures and controls to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and systems. We have established policies and procedures leveraging widely accepted industry standard cyber security frameworks like National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to safeguard against cyber-attacks. Furthermore, we perform penetration testing and engage third parties to assess the effectiveness of our security

program. Additionally, we perform organization-wide cybersecurity awareness training multiple times a year and have established a multi-layer recovery plan of our information technology ecosystem to protect against business interruption. Our dedicated team of cybersecurity professionals utilize a variety of cyber protection tools and methods to monitor and enforce our cybersecurity controls and procedures. We also monitor current developments in the cybersecurity industry and adopt new tools and technologies deemed suitable to our environment in order to continuously enhance our cybersecurity profile. However, despite all of our efforts to strengthen our cybersecurity program, there is no guarantee that a significant cyber-attack will not occur in the future. We maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage related to cyber-attacks and other information security breaches; however, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cybersecurity risks.
 The Company’s Audit Committee and Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Committee of the Board of Directors are jointly responsible for the oversight of cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee reviews quarterly with management the Company’s cybersecurity program and related matters.
We have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past; however, to date, these incidents have not represented a material breach, nor have they had a material impact on our operations or financial results. Future cybersecurity incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, or operating results. Expenses incurred in connection with information security incidents have been immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
 Government Regulation
Our current and contemplated activities and the products and processes that will result from such activities are subject to substantial government rules and regulations, both in the United States and internationally. Such rules and regulations are subject to change by the governing agencies, and we monitor those changes closely.
Environmental Regulations
 Most of our production facilities are subject to various federal, state, local, and/or foreign environmental regulations related to the use, storage, handling, and disposal of regulated materials, chemicals, and certain waste products.
We may face increasing complexity in our product designs and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of product compliance standards. Those standards may impact the material composition of our products entering specific markets. Such regulations went into effect in the European Union (“EU”) in 2006 (“The Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive” (“RoHS”)) and in 2007 (“Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals” (“REACH”)), and in China in 2007 (“Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products Regulation” (“China-RoHS”)).
 Our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position have not been, and are not expected to be, materially affected by our compliance with federal, state, and local environmental provisions that have been enacted or adopted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment.
 Medical Device Regulations
 Certain products manufactured by us are integrated into systems by our customers that are subject to regulation by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and foreign regulatory authorities. We must comply with certain quality control measurements in order for our products to be effectively used in our customers’ end products. Non-compliance with quality control measurements could result in fines, penalties, and loss of business with our customers.
We are also subject to certain medical device regulations. Medical devices are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign authorities as well as notified bodies. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and related regulations govern the conditions of safety, efficacy, clearance, approval, manufacturing, quality system requirements, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, recordkeeping, reporting, marketing, advertising, and promotion of medical devices.
 FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General

Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (the “QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. In many cases, our customers are responsible for compliance with the FDA’s requirements applicable to medical devices. However, we also currently market certain Class II medical device products independently that are subject to these requirements.
 510(k) Marketing Clearance Pathway
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from nine to twelve months, but may take significantly longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
 If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
 After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, a de novo classification or PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacturer documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is prepared by the manufacturer in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for every change. The FDA can always review these letters-to-file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. In these circumstances, we may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
Post-market Regulations
 After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 •establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
 •QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
 •labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading and fairly balanced, provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; 
 •FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information;
 •clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of the cleared devices;


•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device that it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
 •correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
 •requirements governing Unique Device Identifiers on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database;
 •the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
 •post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data on the device.
 Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and a complaints file. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
 The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
 •warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
 •recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;
 •operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
 •refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
 •withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
 •refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or
 •criminal prosecution.
 Regulation of Medical Devices in the European Union and U.K.
 The EU has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigation, conformity assessment, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices.
 Until May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by the Council Directive 93/42/EEC (“EU Medical Devices Directive”) which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (“EU Medical Devices Regulation”). Our current certificates have been granted and renewed under the EU Medical Devices Directive. Pursuing marketing of medical devices in the EU will notably require that our devices be certified under the new regime set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation when our current certificates expire. According to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, several transitional provisions are in place (Article 120) to avoid market disruption and allow a smooth transition from the EU Medical Devices Directive to the EU Medical Devices Regulation. Some device certificates issued under the EU Medical Devices Directive (“MDD certificates”) may remain valid until May 26, 2024, and some devices with MDD certificates may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid and no significant change must be made to the device in question. However, as of May 26, 2021, some of the EU Medical Devices Regulation requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance, market surveillance and vigilance requirements. During the transition phase, products certified under the EU Medical Devices Directive and products certified under the EU Medical Devices Regulation will

coexist on the market. Both will have equal status under the law, and no discrimination on eligibility criteria in public tenders may take place.
 EU Medical Devices Directive
 Under the EU Medical Devices Directive, all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant essential requirements in the EU Medical Devices Directive, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performance intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter as it creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.
 To demonstrate compliance with the requirements in the EU Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its risk classification. As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks and any adverse events are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturer’s quality system under the relevant harmonized standards, such as ISO 13485:2016 for Medical Devices Quality Management Systems. If satisfied that a relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, a notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the European Conformity (“CE”) mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU.
 Throughout the term of the certificate of conformity, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificate(s).
EU Medical Devices Regulation
 The recently effective EU Medical Devices Regulation establishes a uniform regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices. Unlike the EU Medical Devices Directive, the EU Medical Devices Regulation is directly applicable in EU member states without the need for member states to implement it into national law. The new EU Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market, reinforces surveillance once they are available and, establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market.
 The EU Medical Devices Regulation became effective on May 26, 2021. Devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021 may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid and no substantial change must be made to the device as such a modification would trigger the obligation to obtain a new certification under the EU Medical Devices Regulation and therefore to have a notified body conducting a new conformity assessment of the devices. However, even in this case, manufacturers must comply with a number of new or reinforced requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation, including the obligations described below.
 The EU Medical Devices Regulation requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers (as well as other economic operators such as authorized representatives and importers) must register by submitting identification information to the electronic system (Eudamed), unless they have already registered. The information to be submitted by manufacturers (and authorized representatives) also includes the name, address and contact details of the person or persons responsible for regulatory compliance. The new Regulation also requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers must assign a unique identifier to the device and provide it along with other core data to the unique device identifier (“UDI”) database. These new requirements aim at ensuring better identification and traceability of the devices. Each device

– and as applicable, each package – will have a UDI composed of two parts: a device identifier (“UDI-DI”), specific to a device, and a production identifier (“UDI-PI”) to identify the unit producing the device. Manufacturers are also notably responsible for entering the necessary data on Eudamed, which includes the UDI database, and for keeping it up to date. The obligations for registration in Eudamed will become applicable at a later date (as Eudamed is not yet fully functional). Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply for the purpose of meeting the obligations laid down in the provisions regarding exchange of information, including, and in particular, information regarding registration of devices and economic operators.
All manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system. Under this system, serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (“FSCAs”) required to be taken by manufacturers must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states. These reports will have to be submitted through Eudamed – once functional – and aim to ensure that, in addition to reporting to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, other actors such as the economic operators in the supply chain will also be informed. Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply. Manufacturers are required to take FSCAs, which are defined as any corrective action for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market. A serious incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance of a device on the market (e.g., inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer, undesirable side-effect), which, directly or indirectly, might lead to either the death or serious deterioration of the health of a patient, user, or other persons, or to a serious public health threat. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices. For similar serious incidents that occur with the same device or device type and for which the root cause has been identified or a FSCA implemented or where the incidents are common and well documented, manufacturers may provide periodic summary reports instead of individual serious incident reports.
 The advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth in EU legislation. According to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, only devices that are CE marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example, requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at a national level. EU member states’ laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices, which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medical devices, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts” which impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the United States, on medical device manufacturers. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs.
 In the EU, regulatory authorities have the power to carry out announced and, if necessary, unannounced inspections of companies, as well as suppliers and/or sub-contractors and, where necessary, the facilities of professional users. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements (as applicable) could require time and resources to respond to the regulatory authorities’ observations and to implement corrective and preventive actions, as appropriate. Regulatory authorities have broad compliance and enforcement powers and if such issues cannot be resolved to their satisfaction can take a variety of actions, including untitled or warning letters, fines, consent decrees, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
United Kingdom
 Since January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) has been the sovereign regulatory authority responsible for the medical device market in Great Britain (i.e. England, Wales and Scotland). The regulations on medical devices in Great Britain continue to be based largely on the two EU Directives (the EU Medical Devices Directive and Directive 90/385/EEC, or “EU Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive”) which preceded the EU Medical Devices Regulation, as implemented into national law by the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (“SI 2002 No 618”, as amended). However, under the terms of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, the EU Medical Devices Regulation applies to Northern Ireland.
 On June 26, 2022, the MHRA published its response to a 10-week consultation on the post-Brexit regulatory framework for medical devices and diagnostics. The MHRA seeks to amend the Medical Devices Regulations 2002, in particular to create a new

access pathway to support innovation, create an innovative framework for regulating software and artificial intelligence as medical devices, reform in-vitro diagnostic medical device regulation and foster sustainability through the reuse and remanufacture of medical devices. Regulations implementing the new regime were originally scheduled to come into force in July 2023, but the Government has recently confirmed that this date is likely to be postponed until July 2024. Devices which have valid CE certification issued by EU notified bodies under the EU Medical Devices Regulation or EU Medical Devices Directive are subject to transitional arrangements. In its consultation response, the MHRA indicated that the future UK regulations will allow devices certified under the EU Medical Devices Regulation to be placed on the market in Great Britain under the CE mark until either the certificate expires or for five years after the new regulations take effect, whichever is sooner. Devices certified under the EU Medical Devices Directive could continue to be placed on the market until either the certificate expires or for three years after the new regulations take effect, whichever is sooner. Following these transitional periods, it is expected that all medical devices will require a UK Conformity Assessment (“UKCA”) mark. Manufacturers may choose to use the UKCA mark on a voluntary basis prior to the regulations coming into force. However, from July 2024, products which do not have existing and valid certification under the EU Medical Devices Directive or EU Medical Devices Regulation and are therefore not subject to the transitional arrangements will be required to carry the UKCA mark if they are to be sold into the market in Great Britain. UKCA marking will not be recognized in the EU. The rules for placing medical devices on the market in Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K., differ from those in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and continues to be based on EU law.
For further information regarding EU and U.K. healthcare laws and regulations that our operations are subject to, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business— We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulations, which may impede or hinder the approval, certification or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval or certification of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved or certified products.”
 Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 In the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate our business, there are healthcare laws and regulations that constrain our business operations, including our sales, marketing and promotional activities, and that limit the kinds of arrangements we may have with customers, physicians, healthcare entities and others in a position to purchase or recommend our products or other products or services we may develop and commercialize. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, pricing reporting, and physician payment transparency laws and regulations regarding drug pricing and payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and other licensed healthcare professionals as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the United States. Violations of these laws may result in substantial civil penalties, including treble damages, and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs.
Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality, and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, including HIPAA, could apply to our operations or the operations of our customers. In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), and the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to make compliance efforts more challenging, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant penalties and restrictions on data processing.
