ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
 
Our business specializes in the development, production and sale of innovative medications that offer unique competitive advantages and serve unmet needs in the marketplace. Prior to 2017, the Company’s business was primarily focused on its ImprimisRx business, the nation’s leading ophthalmology pharmaceutical compounding business, and Park Compounding, Inc. (“Park”), a leading health and wellness compounding business. Since 2017, in addition to ImprimisRx and Park, we also have founded and have continuing equity positions in Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Eton”), Surface Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Surface”), and Melt Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Melt”). In 2018, the Company also founded the subsidiaries Mayfield Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Mayfield”) and Radley Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Radley”). The Company owns royalty rights in certain 505(b)(2) drug candidates being developed by Eton, Surface, Melt, Radley and Mayfield. Harrow intends to continue to pursue its operations through subsidiaries for, and royalty rights in, new businesses that commercialize drug candidates that are internally developed or otherwise acquired or licensed from third parties.
Pharmaceutical Compounding Businesses
 
Pharmaceutical Compounding
 
Pharmaceutical compounding is the science of combining different active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), all of which are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) (either as a finished form product or as a bulk drug ingredient) and excipients, to create specialized pharmaceutical preparations. Physicians and healthcare institutions use compounded drugs when commercially available drugs do not optimally treat a patient’s needs. In many cases, compounded drugs, such as ours, have wide market utility and may be clinically appropriate for large patient populations. Examples of compounded formulations include medications with alternative dosage strengths or unique dosage forms, such as topical creams or gels, suspensions, or solutions with more tolerable drug delivery vehicles.
 
Almost all of our sales revenue is derived from making, selling and dispensing our compounded prescription drug formulations as cash pay transactions between us and our end-user customer. As such, the majority of our commercial transactions do not involve distributors, wholesalers, insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers or other middle parties. By not being reliant on insurance company formulary inclusion and pharmacy benefit manager payment clawbacks, we are able to simplify the prescription transaction process. We believe the outcome of our business model is a simple transaction, involving a patient-in-need, a physician’s diagnosis and a fair price and great service for a quality pharmaceutical product. We sell our products through a network of employees and independent contractors and we dispense our formulations in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and in selected markets outside the United States.

Our Compounding Facilities
 
Pharmaceutical compounding businesses are governed by Sections 503A and 503B of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”). Section 503A of the FDCA provides that a pharmacy is only permitted to compound a drug for an individually identified patient based on a prescription for a patient, and is only permitted to distribute the drug interstate if the pharmacy is licensed to do so in the states where it is compounded and where the medication is received.
 
Section 503B of the FDCA provides that a pharmacy engaged in preparing sterile compounded drug formulations may voluntarily elect to register as an “outsourcing facility.” Outsourcing facilities are permitted to compound large quantities of drugs without a prescription and distribute them out of state with certain limitations such as the formulation appearing on the FDA’s drug shortage list or the bulk drug substances contained in the formulations appearing on the FDA’s “clinical need” list. Entities voluntarily registering with FDA as outsourcing facilities are subject to additional requirements that do not apply to compounding pharmacies (operating under Section 503A of the FDCA), including adhering to standards such as current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) or other FDA guidance documents and being subject to regular FDA inspection.
 
We operate three compounding facilities. Our New Jersey operations are comprised of two separate entities and facilities, one of which is registered with the FDA as an outsourcing facility (“NJOF”) under Section 503B of the FDCA. The other New Jersey facility (“RxNJ”), and Park Compounding, Inc. (“Park”), our California based pharmacy, are both licensed pharmacies operating under Sections 503A of the FDCA. All products that we sell, produce and dispense are made in the United States of America.
 
We believe that, with our current compounding pharmacy facilities and licenses and the successful completion and FDA registration of NJOF, we have the infrastructure to scale our business appropriately under the current regulatory landscape and meet the potential growth in demand we are targeting. We plan to invest in one or more of our pharmacies to further their capacity and efficiencies. Also, we may seek to access greater pharmacy and production related redundancy and markets through acquisitions, partnerships or other strategic transactions.
 
ImprimisRx
 
ImprimisRx is our ophthalmology focused pharmaceutical compounding business. We offer to over 3,000 physician customers and their patients critical medicines to meet their needs that are unmet by commercially available drugs. We make our formulations available at prices that are, in most cases, lower than non-customized commercial drugs. Our current ophthalmology formulary includes over twenty compounded formulations, many of which are patented or patent-pending, and are customizable for the specific needs of a patient. Some examples of our compounded medications are various combinations of drugs formulated into one bottle and numerous preservative free formulations. Depending on the formulation, the regulations of a specific state and ultimately the needs of the patient, ImprimisRx products may be dispensed as patient-specific medications from our 503A pharmacies, or for in-office use, made according to current good manufacturing practices (or cGMPs) or other FDA guidance documents, in our FDA-registered NJOF outsourcing facility.
 
Ophthalmology Market
 
The three largest markets in the ophthalmology market in the U.S. are ocular surgery, glaucoma and dry eye disease.
 
For any ocular procedure, a surgeon may require drugs for sedation, dilation, and inflammation and infection prevention. The cataract surgery market continues to experience significant growth. According to a 2018 iData report , 3.7 million cataract surgeries were performed in the U.S. in 2017. The National Eye Institute estimates that over 24 million Americans currently have cataracts and that this number will grow to 38 million by 2030 and reach more than 50 million by 2050. In addition to the 3.7 million cataract surgeries performed annually in the U.S., the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) estimates that over one-half of Americans require some form of vision correction and 43 million of these individuals are candidates for refractive surgery. Nearly 96 percent of the refractive surgery procedures performed are LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis) surgeries, an outpatient surgical procedure used to treat nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. According to Statista, an estimated 600,000 LASIK procedures were performed in the U.S. in 2015.
 
According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, there are over 3 million Americans with glaucoma but only half are aware they have it. Open-angle glaucoma (the most common type of glaucoma) is a condition of increased intraocular pressure that causes gradual loss of sight. Glaucoma is incurable, and if not managed can lead to blindness. Generally, the first line of treatment consists of a prostaglandin analogue (PGA) eye drop regimen. As the disease progresses, non-PGA products are generally added as a second line treatment. Topical agents, other than PGAs, include beta blockers, alpha agonists, miotics and steroids. According to a 2013 article in Glaucoma Today, up to 50 percent of glaucoma patients require more than one drug following a few months of initial treatment and there is a direct correlation between the number of glaucoma bottles and decreased adherence; however the FDA has yet to approve a PGA combination product despite combination products including a PGA (Xalacom®, DuoTrav® and Ganfort®) available outside of the U.S. According to a 2017 Market Scope report, the glaucoma pharmaceuticals market is expected to reach $5.3 billion in 2022.

Dry eye occurs when the eye does not produce enough tears, or when the tears are not of the correct consistency and evaporate too quickly. Inflammation of the surface of the eye may also occur. We believe that dry eye disease, or DED, affects over 30 million people in the United States, and a major epidemiological study, the Beaver Dam Offspring Study, published in 2014 in the American Journal of Ophthalmology, reported that in a cohort of over 3,000 patients, DED was self-reported by 14.5% of the patients. According to a 2017 Market Scope report, the global dry eye treatments market is expected to grow from $3.7 billion in 2017 to $4.9 billion in 2022. Dry eye is among the most common conditions seen by eye care professionals.
 
Park Compounding
 
Park, our wholly owned subsidiary pharmacy based in Irvine, California, is focused on primarily on health and wellness related, customizable pharmaceutical compounding. Park dispenses sterile and non-sterile compounded medications prescribed by licensed practitioners when commercially available choices do not meet a patient’s needs. Park also produces and dispenses certain of our ophthalmology-based formulations.
Pharmaceutical Development Businesses
 
We have ownership positions in Eton, Surface, Melt, and Mayfield and hold royalty interests in certain of their drug candidates. These companies are pursuing market approval for their drug candidates under the FDCA, including under the abbreviated pathway described in Section 505(b)(2) which permits the submission of a new drug application (NDA) where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. In 2018, we formed our Radley and Mayfield subsidiaries We intend to pursue our business strategies though subsidiaries and royalty interests that will focus on the development and FDA approval of certain proprietary drug formulations that we currently own, will in-license/acquire and/or otherwise develop.
Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
Eton is a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative products utilizing the FDA’s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Its pipeline includes seven products in various stages of development across a variety of dosage forms. Eton’s pipeline is focused on innovative 505(b)(2) products and obtaining FDA marketing approval for currently marketed but unapproved drugs.
 
In May 2017, we entered into two asset purchase and license agreements (the “Eton License Agreements”) with our then wholly owned subsidiary, Eton. Pursuant to the terms of the Eton License Agreements, we assigned and licensed to Eton certain intellectual property and related rights to develop, formulate, make, sell, and sub-license our proprietary formulations including synthetic corticotropin (Eton drug candidate CT-100) (collectively, the “Harrow Products”). Eton, by itself or through a development partner, intends to seek FDA approval for the commercialization of CT-100 through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. If approved by the FDA, Eton is required to make royalty payments to us on CT-100. In addition to CT-100, Eton has acquired several additional drug candidates and ones that qualify under the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) program which it plans to develop and commercialize. Harrow is only eligible to receive royalties on CT-100 (corticotropin) and will not receive royalties on any other drug candidates currently being developed by Eton.
 
In June 2017, Eton closed an offering of its Series A Preferred Stock at $3.00 a share for gross proceeds of approximately $20 million (the “Series A Round”). At the time of closing we lost our controlling interest, and deconsolidated Eton from our consolidated financial statements. In November 2018, Eton closed on an initial public offering of 4,140,000 shares of its common stock at $6.00 a share for gross proceeds of approximately $24.8 million (the “Eton IPO”). Following the close of the Eton IPO, all shares of the Eton Series A Preferred Stock converted to Eton common stock. As of the date of this Annual Report, we own 3.5 million shares of Eton common stock, which we estimate is approximately 19.98% of the equity and voting interests issued and outstanding of Eton following the close of the Eton IPO. Eton’s common stock currently trades on the NASDAQ Global Market exchange under the ticker symbol “ETON”. Our CEO Mark Baum serves on the board of directors of Eton.
 
Surface Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
Surface is a development-stage pharmaceutical company focused on development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics for ocular surface diseases and is seeking FDA approval for the commercialization of its drug candidates through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway under the FDCA. In 2017 and amended in April 2018, Harrow entered into asset purchase and license agreements (the “Surface License Agreements”) and transferred to Surface its current drug pipeline, which consists of three proprietary drug candidates. Surface’s patent-pending topical eye drop drug candidates, SURF-100 and SURF-200, utilize a patented delivery vehicle known as Klarity Drops (“Klarity”), that was invented by Harrow board member and Surface’s chairman of the board and renowned ophthalmologist Dr. Richard Lindstrom. Klarity is designed to protect and rehabilitate the ocular surface pathology for patients with DED. Surface’s drug candidate SURF-300 is a patent-pending oral capsule that will target patients also suffering from DED signs and symptoms. 
 
In May and in July 2018, Surface closed on an offering of its Series A Preferred Stock at $3.30 a share for proceeds of approximately $21 million (the “Surface Series A Round”). At that time, we lost our controlling interest and deconsolidated Surface from our consolidated financial statements, and currently own approximately 30% of the issued and outstanding voting interests in Surface. Our CEO Mark Baum, and director, Richard Lindstrom serve on the board of directors of Surface.

Melt Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
Melt is a development-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary non-intravenous (or IV) sedation and anesthesia therapeutics for human medical procedures in hospital, outpatient, and in-office settings. Melt intends to seek regulatory approval through the FDA’s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for its proprietary technologies, where possible. In December 2018, Harrow entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Melt (the “Melt Asset Purchase Agreement”), and Harrow assigned to Melt the underlying intellectual property for Melt’s current pipeline, including its lead drug candidate MELT-100. The core intellectual property Melt owns is a patented series of combination non-opioid sedation drug formulations that we believe to have multitudinous applications. Pursuant to the terms of the Melt Asset Purchase Agreement, Melt is required to make royalty payments to the Company up to eight percent (8%) of net sales of products described in the Melt Asset Purchase Agreement, while any patent rights remain outstanding, as well as other conditions.
 
Melt’s lead 505(b)(2) drug candidate is MELT-100, which combines small, fixed doses of midazolam and ketamine in a dissolving tablet form, that is administered sublingually for conscious sedation during cataract surgery. Based on our experience, we believe there is a strong patient preference for sedation medications delivered sublingually as opposed to the traditional route, which is through an IV method. MELT-100 combines small, fixed doses of midazolam and ketamine in a dissolving tablet form, that is administered sublingually for conscious sedation during cataract surgery. MELT-100 is based on Imprimis’ existing MKO Melt formulation, which is comprised of the three active ingredients midazolam, ketamine and ondansetron. MKO Melt has an established history of use in cataract surgery, having been dispensed approximately 100,000 times as a compounded drug since 2016. We intend to leverage the real-world evidence generated by ImprimisRx and more than 400 U.S. cataract surgeons to inform and guide the design and execution of MELT-100’s clinical and commercial development programs.
 
Based solely on the more than 4 million cataract surgeries performed in the US in 2017, we believe the potential U.S. market opportunity for MELT-100 will be in excess of $1 billion. This estimate assumes that MELT-100 will be granted transitional pass-through reimbursement status, or be eligible for separate payment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, code under Medicare Part B. Pass-through status is designed to promote innovation and allows for separate payment (i.e., outside the packaged procedural payment) under Medicare Part B for certain new drugs and other medical technologies when used in hospital outpatient or ambulatory surgery centers and that meet well-established criteria specified by federal law and regulations governing Medicare spending. Pass through reimbursement status generally lasts for three years, and subsequently payment for the product is then included as part of the packaged payment for the associated procedure for Medicare patients. In the recently released 2019 proposed rules for the CMS outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS), CMS indicated that it will separately pay in the ambulatory surgical center, or ASC, setting for non-opioid drugs with an FDA-approved indication for postoperative pain relief. In addition to this proposed rule, an extension of the pass-through reimbursement period to five years was allowed for certain products in October 2018. 
 
In January 2019, Melt completed a Pre-IND meeting with FDA, and intends to begin enrolling patients for clinical studies related to MELT-100 in 2020. 
 
During January 2019, Melt closed on the sale of its Series A Preferred Stock at $5.00 a share for gross proceeds of approximately $11 million (the “Melt Series A Round”). At the time of the closing we lost our controlling interest, and deconsolidated Melt from our consolidated financial statements. We own 3.5 million shares of Melt common stock, which is approximately 44% of the equity and voting interests issued and outstanding of Melt. In addition to our Melt equity position and pursuant to the Melt Asset Purchase Agreement, Harrow is eligible to receive mid-single digit percent royalties on sales of contributed drug candidates. Our CEO Mark Baum, and CFO, Andrew Boll serve on the board of directors of Melt.
 
Mayfield Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
Mayfield, a consolidated subsidiary of Harrow, is a development-stage women’s and men’s health focused pharmaceutical company. Mayfield intends to seek regulatory approval through the FDA’s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for its proprietary drug candidates and technologies, including its lead drug candidates MAY-44 and MAY-66. MAY-44 is non-estrogen topical analgesic gel containing a patented pH-balanced formulation of 3.75% lidocaine and other essential excipients designed for use on mucosal surfaces. If FDA-approved, MAY-44 could become the first topical product indicated for dyspareunia. We believe there are an estimated 32 million women in the U.S. who suffer from moderate-to-severe dyspareunia (Clinical Medicine Insights: Reproductive Health 2014), and 64 million post-menopausal women in the U.S. for whom dyspareunia is common. Other more recent estimates suggest dyspareunia affects greater than one in ten women (BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology 2017). In a proprietary market research report completed in December 2017, a survey of OB/GYN practices estimated that one in every four patients complained of some level of dyspareunia each month. It was also estimated that two-thirds of women complaining of dyspareunia are post-menopausal and one-third are pre- or peri-menopausal. Mayfield’s MAY-66 drug candidate a patented, injectable form of pentoxifylline designed for use in the treatment of symptoms associated with Peyronie’s disease.
 
Mayfield and Harrow acquired the intellectual property associated with MAY-44 in January 2019 from Elle Pharmaceutical LLC (the “Mayfield Asset Purchase Agreement”) in exchange for $25,000, with an additional $175,000 due upon third party financing of Mayfield, 1 million shares of Mayfield common stock and a 7.5% royalty rate on sales of the product. Once we have finalized the drug candidate assets Mayfield will seek to develop, we intend to build out the Mayfield management, board and clinical advisory team.

Radley Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
Radley, a consolidated subsidiary of Harrow, is a development-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of proprietary 505(b)(2) drug candidates focused on rare diseases. During 2019, and prior to initiating significant development activities and costs related to its drug candidates, we intend to meet with FDA to establish and understand the expected clinical and regulatory path to approval for these drug candidates. We are also pursuing investigator-initiated studies for some of Radley’s drug candidates with well-known healthcare institutions. We believe this approach will allow us to better understand and weigh the economic costs, clinical feasibility and potential benefits associated with pursuing development activities associated with these drug candidates.
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
 
As an alternate path for FDA approval of new indications or new formulations of previously-approved products, a company may file a Section 505(b)(2) NDA instead of a “stand-alone” or “full” NDA. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Some examples of products that may be allowed to follow a 505(b)(2) path to approval are drugs that have a new dosage form, strength, route of administration, formulation or indication.
 
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit the applicant to rely upon certain published nonclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product or the FDA’s conclusions from prior review of such studies. The FDA may require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the labeled indications for which the reference product has been approved, as well as for any new indication supported by the Section 505(b)(2) application. While references to nonclinical and clinical data not generated by the applicant or for which the applicant does not have a right of reference are allowed, all development, process, stability, qualification and validation data related to the manufacturing and quality of the new product must be included in an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2).
 
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s conclusions regarding studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the reference product has expired. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its products only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its products may be commercialized.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
The focus of our sales and marketing is in the United States. We do, however, believe that our proprietary drug formulations could have commercial appeal in international markets, and we have engaged distributors and entered into out-licensing arrangements for certain of our proprietary formulations in certain non-U.S. markets, including Canada. Our sales and marketing efforts are currently organized into two teams, the larger of which focuses on our ophthalmology pharmaceutical compounding business and the other on our non-ophthalmology pharmaceutical compounding business. Our sales and marketing activities consist primarily of efforts to educate doctors, ambulatory surgery centers, healthcare systems, hospitals and other users throughout the U.S. about our compounded formulations. We expect that we may experience growth in the sales of our proprietary pharmaceutical compounded formulations in future periods, particularly in light of our current and planned launches of new formulations and commercialization campaigns. However, we may not be successful in doing so, whether due to the safety, quality or availability of our proprietary compounded formulations, the size of the markets for such formulations, which could be smaller than we expect, the timing of market entry relative to competitive products, the availability of alternative compounded formulations or FDA-approved drugs, the price of our compounded formulations relative to alternative products or the success of our sales and marketing efforts, which is dependent on our ability to build and grow a qualified and adequate internal sales function.
 
During 2017 and 2018, we entered various sales and marketing agreements, with certain organizations to provide exclusive sales and marketing representation services to ImprimisRx in select geographies in the U.S., in connection with our ophthalmic compounded formulations. Under the terms of the sales and marketing agreements, we are required to make commission payments to equal to 10% to 14% of net sales for products above and beyond the initial existing sales amounts. In addition, we are required to make periodic milestone payments to certain organizations in shares of the our restricted common stock if net sales in the assigned territory reach certain future levels by the end of their terms, as applicable. We believe these sales and marketing agreements will accelerate launches of our new ophthalmology programs and limit our initial capital requirements commonly associated with new product launches and increased sizes of sales forces.

Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and pharmacy industries are highly competitive. We compete against branded drug companies, generic drug companies, outsourcing facilities and other compounding pharmacies. We are significantly smaller than some of our competitors, and we may lack the financial and other resources needed to develop, produce, distribute, market and commercialize any of our proprietary formulations or compete for market share in these sectors. The drug products available through branded and generic drug companies with which our formulations compete have been approved for marketing and sale by the FDA and are required to be manufactured in facilities compliant with cGMP standards. Although we prepare some of our compounded formulations in accordance with cGMP standards and our other formulations are produced according to the standards provided by United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) <795> and USP <797> and applicable state and federal law, our proprietary compounded formulations are not required to be, and have not been, approved for marketing and sale by the FDA. As a result, some physicians may be unwilling to prescribe, and some patients may be unwilling to use, our formulations. Additionally, under federal and state laws applicable to our current compounding pharmacy operations operating under Section 503A of the FDCA, we are not permitted to prepare significant amounts of a specific formulation in advance of a prescription, compound quantities for office use or utilize a wholesaler for distribution of our formulations; instead, our compounded formulations must be prepared and dispensed in connection with a physician prescription for an individually identified patient. Pharmaceutical companies, on the other hand, are able to sell their FDA-approved products to large pharmaceutical wholesalers, who can in turn sell to and supply hospitals and retail pharmacies. Even though we have registered NJOF with the FDA, our business may not be scalable on the scope available to our competitors that produce FDA-approved drugs, which may limit our potential for profitable operations. These facets of our operations may subject our business to limitations our competitors offering FDA-approved drugs may not face.
 
Biotechnology and related pharmaceutical technologies are subject to rapid and significant change. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Products developed by our competitors, including FDA-approved drugs and compounded formulations created by other pharmacies, could render our products and technologies obsolete or unable to compete. Any products that we develop may become obsolete before we recover expenses incurred in developing the products, which may require that we seek additional funds that may or may not be available to continue our operations. The competitive environment requires an ongoing, extensive search for medical and technological innovations and the ability to develop and market these innovations effectively, and we may not be competitive with respect to these factors. Other competitive factors include the safety and efficacy of a product, the size of the market for a product, the timing of market entry relative to competitive products, the availability of alternative compounded formulations or approved drugs, the price of a product relative to alternative products, the availability of third-party reimbursement, the success of sales and marketing efforts, brand recognition and the availability of scientific and technical information about a product. Although we believe we are positioned to compete favorably with respect to many of these factors, if our proprietary formulations are unable to compete with the products of our competitors, we may never gain market share or achieve profitability.

Factors Affecting Our Performance
 
We believe the primary factors affecting our performance are our ability to increase revenues of our proprietary compounded formulations and certain non-proprietary products, grow and gain operating efficiencies in our pharmacy operations, optimize pricing and obtain reimbursement options for our proprietary compounded formulations, and continue to pursue development and commercialization opportunities for certain of our ophthalmology and other assets that we have not yet made commercially available as compounded formulations. We believe we have built a tangible and intangible infrastructure that will allow us to scale revenues efficiently in the long-term. All of these activities will require significant costs and other resources, which we may not have or be able to obtain from operations or other sources.
Reimbursement Options and Pricing Optimization
 
Our proprietary ophthalmic pharmaceutical compounded formulations are primarily available on a cash-pay basis. However, we work with third-party insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and buying groups to offer patient-specific customizable compounded formulations at accessible prices. We may devote time and other resources to seek reimbursement and patient pay opportunities for these and other compounded formulations and we have hired pharmacy billers to process certain existing reimbursement opportunities for certain formulations. However, we may be unsuccessful in achieving these goals, as many third-party payors have imposed significant restrictions on reimbursement for compounded formulations in recent years. Moreover, third-party payors, including Medicare, are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and by refusing, in some cases, to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted formal labeling approval. Further, the Health Reform Law may have a considerable impact on the existing U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care and could conceivable have a material effect on our business. As a result, reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors may never be available for any of our products or, if available, may not be sufficient to allow us to sell the products on a competitive basis and at desirable price points. If government and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our formulations, the market acceptance for our formulations may be limited.
 
Additionally, we are making efforts to normalize the pricing for our currently available proprietary compounded ophthalmic formulations. An economic study conducted in 2015 by researchers at Andrew Chang & Co, LLC and co-sponsored by us demonstrated that, assuming the cost of Dropless Therapy is $100 per dose, our formulations may provide collective savings to Medicare, Medicaid and patients of up to $13 billion, with a most likely savings estimate of $8.7 billion, over a 10-year period. Based on this research, we believe optimized pricing for certain of our compounded formulations could be greater than $100 per dose. Any efforts to attain optimized pricing for these or any of our other proprietary formulations could fail, which could make our products less attractive or unavailable to some patients or could reduce our margins.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success and ability to compete depends upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. We conduct a fulsome analysis of the intellectual property landscape prior to acquiring rights to formulations and filing patent applications. In addition, as of February 28, 2019, we owned and/or licensed nine U.S. issued patents, two international issued patents, and 32 U.S. patent applications, including 29 utility (including continuation, continuation-in-part and divisional) and three provisional patent applications, and we owned seven international patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and 42 foreign patent applications. We presently have 14 U.S. and 13 foreign patent applications pending that relate to our SSP Technology. We expect to file additional patent applications in the U.S. and pursue patent protection for certain of our formulations in other important international jurisdictions in the future.
 
As of February 28, 2019, we had worldwide 180 issued trademarks, pending trademark and copyright applications, or registered copyright and/or trademarks including, but not limited to: Imprimis®, ImprimisRx®, Harrow Healthtm, Dropless®, LessDrops®, Dropless Cataract Surgery®, Dropless Cataract Therapy®, Dropless Therapy®, MKO Melt™, and Simple Dropstm. We may choose to pursue trademark protection in other jurisdictions for any one or more of these or other marks in the future.
 
We also rely on unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation in order to develop our formulations, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators and others, including certain service providers. We also have invention or patent assignment agreements with our current employees and certain consultants. However, our employees and consultants may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, or our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. In addition, inventions relevant to us could be developed by a person not bound by an invention assignment agreement with us, in which case we may have no rights to use the applicable invention.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices, including, among others: federal, state and local licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2012 (collectively, the Health Reform Law); statutes and regulations of the FDA, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as regulations promulgated by comparable state agencies concerning the sale, advertisement and promotion of the products we sell. The regulatory and quality compliance environment for compounded drugs has become significantly more rigorous, complex and strict since the passage of The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013. The complexity of the current state and federal regulatory environment, as well as the expected continued evolution of state and federal laws governing pharmaceutical compounding, have and will continue to present potentially significant challenges to our business model and the fulfillment of our mission as a company. Below are descriptions of some of the various federal and state laws and regulations which may govern or impact our current and planned operations.

Pharmacy Regulation
 
Our pharmacy operations are regulated by both individual states and the federal government. Every state has laws and regulations addressing pharmacy operations, including regulations relating specifically to compounding pharmacy operations. These regulations generally include licensing requirements for pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacies, as well as regulations related to compounding processes, safety protocols, purity, sterility, storage, controlled substances, recordkeeping and regular inspections, among other things. State rules and regulations are updated periodically, generally under the jurisdiction of individual state boards of pharmacy. Failure to comply with the state pharmacy regulations of a particular state could result in a pharmacy being prohibited from operating in that state, financial penalties and/or becoming subject to additional oversight from that state’s board of pharmacy. In addition, many states are considering imposing, or have already begun to impose, more stringent requirements on compounding pharmacies. If our pharmacy operations become subject to additional licensure requirements, are unable to maintain their required licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on pharmacies, our ability to operate in some states could be limited.
 
Federal law limits compounding pharmacies from engaging in the practice of anticipatory compounding, which involves preparing compounded medications before the actual receipt of a prescription or practitioner’s order, unless the compounding pharmacy has a history of filling certain prescriptions for a customer. In such cases, it is acceptable to engage in anticipatory compounding or the preparation of larger batches so that medications will be ready when they are needed. Anticipatory compounding also reduces the cost of compounded medications, as economies of scale can be realized by producing larger batches. Anticipatory compounding also leads to less wasted chemicals, dilutions, fillers, and other associated products are produced, and greater accuracy and uniformity in finished medications, as larger batches decrease the variation caused by preparing multiple, smaller batches. Based on our history of meeting the needs of our customers, we are able to anticipatorily compound batches of our formulations for our customers, per the applicable regulations.
 
Many of the states into which we deliver pharmaceuticals have laws and regulations that require out-of-state pharmacies to register with, or be licensed by, the boards of pharmacy or similar regulatory bodies in those states. These states generally permit the dispensing pharmacy to follow the laws of the state within which the dispensing pharmacy is located. However, various state pharmacy boards have enacted laws and/or adopted rules or regulations directed at restricting or prohibiting the operation of out-of-state pharmacies by, among other things, requiring compliance with all laws of the states into which the out-of-state pharmacy dispenses medications, whether or not those laws conflict with the laws of the state in which the pharmacy is located, or requiring the pharmacist-in-charge to be licensed in that state. To the extent that such laws or regulations are found to be applicable to our operations, we believe we comply with them.
 
Further, under federal law, Section 503A of the FDCA seeks to limit the amount of compounded products that a pharmacy can distribute interstate. The interpretation and enforcement of this provision is dependent on the FDA entering into a standard Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with each state setting forth limits on shipments of interstate compounding. In January of 2018, the FDA released a “2018 Compounding Policy Priorities Plan” (the “2018 Compounding Plan”) which provided an overview of the key priorities the FDA plans to focus on in 2018 in connection with compounding regulations. One of the priorities outlined in the 2018 Compounding Plan addressed the FDA’s plan to release a revised MOU (the “Revised MOU”). Pursuant to the statements in the Compounding Plan, the Revised MOU would consider amounts shipped interstate by a compounder to be inordinate amounts if the “number of prescriptions of compounded drugs distributed interstate during any calendar month is greater than 50 percent.” Importantly, instead of that number serving as a “hard limit, for state action,” the 50% target would trigger certain additional reporting requirements. The Revised MOU will also provide states more time to report to the FDA, and flexibility on identifying when amounts are inordinate, considering the size and scope of compounding operations. Until the Revised MOU is issued and presented to states to consider, the extent of interstate distribution restrictions imposed by Section 503A is unknown. However, the FDA has continued to state its position that it does not intend to enforce the 5% out of state distribution limit set forth in the law for compounders until a final MOU is made available for a state’s signature. The FDA has proposed a 180 day grace period for states to agree to the final MOU after the final version is presented, which to date has not occurred, before it would begin to enforce the 5% rule. If the final Revised MOU contains a 50% limit on interstate distribution, dependent on the additional reporting requirements to be outlined in the Revised MOU, our pharmacy operations could be materially limited.
 
Certain provisions of the FDCA govern the preparation, handling, storage, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (DQSA) clarifies and strengthens the federal regulatory framework governing compounding pharmacies. Title 1 of the DQSA, the Compounding Quality Act, modifies provisions of the Section 503A of the FDCA that were found to be unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002. In general, Section 503A provides that pharmacies are exempt from the provisions of the FDCA requiring compliance with cGMP, labeling with adequate directions for use and FDA approval prior to marketing if the pharmacy complies with certain other requirements. Among other things, to comply with Section 503A, a compounded drug must be compounded by a licensed pharmacist for an identified individual patient on the basis of a valid prescription. Pharmacies may only compound in limited quantities before receipt of a prescription for an individual patient and are subject to limitations on anticipatory compounding for distribution, which generally permit anticipatory compounding only based on historical prescription volumes.

The DQSA also contained new Section 503B of the FDCA, which established an outsourcing facility as a new form of entity that is permitted to compound larger quantities of drug formulations without a prescription, thus permitting the practice of anticipatory compounding, and distributing them out of state without limitation, if the drug formulations appear on the FDA’s drug shortage list or the bulk drug substances contained in the formulations appear on a “clinical need” list to be established by the FDA. Entities voluntarily registering as outsourcing facilities are subject to cGMP requirements and regular FDA inspection, among other requirements. As described above, our current pharmacy operations in NJ and CA are governed by Section 503A of the FDCA, and our NJ based outsourcing facility is governed by Section 503B of the FDCA.
 
In a recent California federal court ruling in Allergan USA, Inc. v. Prescribers Choice, Inc. the Court made a ruling which could impact 503B facilities. It determined that while the FDA’s interim policies do not override the statutory obligations of the DQSA, the Court supported the FDA’s authority and flexibility as it determines what clinical needs exist and finalizes the bulk drug substances list. The Court did not wish to set a policy that limits the ability of the FDA to determine whether there is a clinical need for particular drugs, while simultaneously allowing the compounding of certain drugs to meet health needs. The Court went on to note that acting “in good faith” in complying with FDA guidelines and processes, means the facility has not run afoul of the DQSA as it relates to California’s Sherman Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law.
 
Confidentiality, Privacy and HIPAA
 
Our pharmacy operations involve the receipt, use and disclosure of confidential medical, pharmacy and other health-related information. In addition, we use aggregated and blinded (anonymous) data for research and analysis purposes. The federal privacy regulations under HIPAA are designed to protect the medical information of a healthcare patient or health plan enrollee that could be used to identify the individual. Among other things, HIPAA limits certain uses and disclosures of protected health information and requires compliance with federal security regulations regarding the storage, utilization and transmission of and access to electronic protected health information. The requirements imposed by HIPAA are extensive. In addition, most states have enacted privacy and security laws that protect identifiable patient information that is not health-related. Further, several states have enacted more protective and comprehensive pharmacy-related privacy legislation that not only applies to patient records but also prohibits the transfer or use for commercial purposes of pharmacy data that identifies prescribers. These regulations impose substantial requirements on covered entities and their business associates regarding the storage, utilization and transmission of and access to personal health and non-health information. Many of these laws apply to our business.
 
Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement
 
Medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance coverage for qualified persons age 65 or older and for some disabled persons with certain specific conditions. State-funded Medicaid programs provide medical benefits to groups of low-income and disabled individuals, some of whom may have inadequate or no medical insurance. Currently, most of our commercially available formulations are sold in cash transactions and the customers decide whether or not to seek reimbursement opportunities from Medicare, Medicaid and other third parties. We work with third-party insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and buying groups to offer patient-specific customizable compounded formulations at accessible prices. We plan to continue to devote time and other resources to seek reimbursement and patient pay opportunities for these and other compounded formulations, and we have hired pharmacy billers to process certain existing reimbursement opportunities for certain formulations. However, we may be unsuccessful in achieving these goals, as many third-party payors have imposed significant restrictions on reimbursement for compounded formulations in recent years. Moreover, third-party payors, including Medicare, are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and by refusing, in some cases, to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted labeling approval. Further, the Health Reform Law may have a considerable impact on the existing U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care and could conceivable have a material effect on our business. As a result, reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors may never be available for any of our products or, if available, may not be sufficient to allow us to sell the products on a competitive basis and at desirable price points.
 
To the extent we obtain third-party reimbursement for our compounded formulations, we may become subject to Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plan regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims.
 
FDA New Drug Application Process
 
As discussed in other sections of this report, we are and may continue to, alone or with project partners, pursue FDA approval to market and sell one or more of our formulations through the FDA’s NDA process. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s conclusions regarding studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book publication. As a condition of approval, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require further studies, including Phase 4 post-marketing studies, to provide additional data. Other post-marketing studies may be required to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those for which the product was initially tested and approved. Also, the FDA or other regulatory authorities require post-marketing reporting to monitor the adverse effects of a drug. Results of post-marketing programs may limit or expand the further marketing of a product.

The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, fines and potential civil and criminal penalties.
 
International Regulation
 
If we pursue commercialization of our proprietary formulations in countries other than the United States, then we may need to obtain the approvals required by the regulatory authorities of such foreign countries that are comparable to the FDA and state boards of pharmacy, and we would be subject to a variety of other foreign statutes and regulations comparable to those relating to our U.S. operations. Regulatory frameworks and requirements vary by country and could involve significant additional licensing requirements and product testing and review periods.
Environmental and Other Matters
 
We are or may become subject to environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, any use and disposal by us of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research and preparation of our formulations. In addition, we are subject to work safety and labor laws that govern certain of our operations and our employee relations. In each of these areas, as described above, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, licenses or permits, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Research and Development Expenses
 
Our research and development expenses incurred in 2018 and 2017 primarily include expenses related to the development of intellectual property, researcher and investigator-initiated evaluations, and research and formulation development related primarily to our ophthalmic formulations and certain other assets, in addition to costs associated with our 505(b)(2) drug candidate development programs.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $825,000 in research and development expenses, as compared to $413,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
Financial Information About Segments and Geographic Areas
 
Beginning on January 1, 2019, the Company began evaluating performance of the Company based on operating segments. Segment performance for its two operating segments will be based on segment contribution. Our reportable segments consist of (i) our commercial stage pharmaceutical compounding business (Pharmaceutical Compounding), generally including the operations of our ImprimisRx and Park Compounding businesses; and (ii) our start-up operations associated with pharmaceutical drug development business (Pharmaceutical Drug Development). Segment contribution for our segments represents net revenues less cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing expenses, and select general and administrative expenses. The Company does not evaluate the following items at the segment level:

● | Operating expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses that result from the impact of corporate initiatives. Corporate initiatives primarily include integration, restructuring, acquisition and other shared costs.
