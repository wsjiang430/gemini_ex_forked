Item 1.  Business
General
 
Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. (the “Corporation”), a Delaware corporation, was organized in January 1996 for the purpose of becoming the holding company of Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B. (the “Bank”) upon the Bank’s conversion from a federal mutual to a federal stock savings bank (“Conversion”).  The Conversion was completed on June 27, 1996.  The Corporation is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB").  At June 30, 2019, the Corporation had consolidated total assets of $1.08 billion, total deposits of $841.3 million and stockholders’ equity of $120.6 million.  The Corporation has not engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank.  Accordingly, the information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”), including the audited consolidated financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank.
 
The Bank, founded in 1956, is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Riverside, California.  The Bank is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), its primary federal regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the insurer of its deposits.  The Bank’s deposits are federally insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC.  The Bank has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) – San Francisco since 1956.
 
The Bank is a financial services company committed to serving consumers and small to mid-sized businesses in the Inland Empire region of Southern California.  The Bank conducts its business operations as Provident Bank, and through its subsidiary, Provident Financial Corp.  The business activities of the Bank consist of community banking, investment services and trustee services for real estate transactions.
 
The Bank’s community banking operations primarily consist of accepting deposits from customers within the communities surrounding its full service offices and investing those funds in single-family, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans.  Additional business activities have included originating saleable single-family loans, primarily fixed-rate first mortgages.  Through its subsidiary, Provident Financial Corp, the Bank conducts trustee services for the Bank’s real estate transactions and in the past has held real estate for investment.  For additional information, see “Subsidiary Activities” in this Form 10-K.  The activities of Provident Financial Corp are included in the Bank's operating segment results.  The Bank’s revenues are derived principally from interest earned on its loan and investment portfolios, and fees generated through its community banking activities.
 
On June 22, 2006, the Bank established the Provident Savings Bank Charitable Foundation (“Foundation”) in order to further its commitment to the local community.  The specific purpose of the Foundation is to promote and provide for the betterment of youth, education, housing and the arts in the Bank’s primary market areas of Riverside and San Bernardino counties.   The Foundation was funded with a $500,000 charitable contribution made by the Bank in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.  The
 Bank contributed $40,000 to the Foundation in both fiscal 2019 and 2018.
 

Subsequent Event:
 
On July 30, 2019, the Corporation announced that the Corporation’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.14 per share.  Shareholders of the Corporation’s common stock at the close of business on August 20, 2019 are entitled to receive the cash dividend, payable on September 10, 2019.

Market Area
 
The Bank is headquartered in Riverside, California and operates 12 full-service banking offices in Riverside County and one full-service banking office in San Bernardino County.  Management considers Riverside and Western San Bernardino counties to be the Bank’s primary market for deposits. The Bank is the largest independent community bank headquartered in Riverside County and it has the ninth largest deposit market share of all banks and the second largest of community banks in Riverside County.
 
The large geographic area encompassing Riverside and San Bernardino counties is referred to as the “Inland Empire.”  According to the 2010 Census Bureau population statistics, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties have the fourth and fifth largest populations in California, respectively.  The Bank’s market area consists primarily of suburban and urban communities.  Western Riverside and San Bernardino counties are relatively densely populated and are within the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area.  According to the United States of America (“U.S.”) Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in the Inland Empire in June 2019 was 4.3%, compared to 4.2% in California and 3.7% nationwide, an improvement compared to the unemployment data reported in June 2018, which was 4.7% in the Inland Empire, 4.2% in California and 4.0% nationwide.
 
In 2019, it has been forecast that the Inland Empire will continue the expansion underway since 2011. Through December 31, 2018, there have been 352,208 jobs created. The 2019 gain is forecast at another 38,200 jobs, up 2.52%. If this occurs, a total of 390,408 local jobs will have been created from 2011-2019 taking the Inland Empire area to 1,556,857 positions. That would be 250,192 jobs or 19.1% above the pre-recession high of 1,306,342 in 2007. Unemployment is forecasted to stay at 4.2% in 2019. Importantly among California’s metropolitan areas, the Inland Empire’s 2018 growth of 49,308 jobs ranked second, somewhat below job growth in Los Angeles (60,908) and well above job growth in San Francisco (33,067), San Diego (32,500), Orange County (32,133), Silicon Valley (20,333) and the East Bay (20,550). Its 3.36% job growth rate led the state ahead of San Francisco’s job growth of 2.97% (Source: Inland Empire Quarterly Economic Reports - April 2019).
 
After rebounding in May 2019, California home sales fell below the benchmark 400,000 units in June 2019 as sales declined from both the previous month and year, according to the California Association of Realtors (“C.A.R.”). Closed escrow sales of existing, single-family detached homes in California totaled a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 389,690 units in June 2019, according to information collected by C.A.R. from more than 90 local Realtor associations and MLSs statewide. The statewide annualized sales figure represents what would be the total number of homes sold during 2019 if sales maintained the June 2019 pace throughout the year. It is adjusted to account for seasonal factors that typically influence home sales. June 2019’s sales figure was down 4.2 percent from the 406,960 units in May 2019 and down 5.1 percent from 410,800 home sales in June 2018. Sales have been under the benchmark for 10 of the past 11 months. While the median price set another record in June 2019, the increase was tempered. June 2019’s median price was $611,420, essentially unchanged from $611,190 in May 2019 and up 1.4 percent from $602,770 in June 2018 (Source: California Association of Realtors – July 17, 2019 News Release).
 

Competition
 
The Bank faces significant competition in its market area in originating real estate loans and attracting deposits.  The population growth in the Inland Empire has attracted numerous financial institutions to the Bank’s market area.  The Bank’s primary competitors are large national and regional commercial banks as well as other community-oriented banks and savings institutions.  The Bank also faces competition from credit unions and a large number of mortgage companies that operate within its market area.  Many of these institutions are significantly larger than the Bank and therefore have greater financial and marketing resources than the Bank. This competition may limit the Bank’s growth and profitability in the future.

Personnel
As of June 30, 2019, the Bank had 187 full-time equivalent employees, which consisted of 138 full-time, 49 prime-time and no part-time employees.  The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and management believes that its relationship with employees is good.
Reportable Segments
 
Management monitors the revenue and expense components of the various products and services the Bank offers, but operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a Corporation-wide basis in comparison to a business plan which is developed each year. Accordingly, all operations are considered by management to be one operating segment and one reportable segment as contained in Note 18 to the Corporation’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Internet Website
 
The Corporation maintains a website at www.myprovident.com. The information contained on that website is not included as a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Form 10-K. Other than an investor’s own internet access charges, the Corporation makes available free of charge through that website the Corporation’s annual report, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after these materials have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  In addition, the SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding companies that file electronically with the SEC.  This information is available at www.sec.gov.
Lending Activities
 
General.  The lending activity of the Bank is comprised of the origination of single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans and, to a lesser extent, construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans to be held for investment.  Additional lending activities have included originating saleable single-family loans, primarily fixed-rate first mortgages. The Bank’s net loans held for investment were $879.9 million at June 30, 2019, representing 81.1% of consolidated total assets.  This compares to $902.7 million, or 76.8% of consolidated total assets, at June 30, 2018.
 
At June 30, 2019, the maximum amount that the Bank could have loaned to any one borrower and the borrower’s related entities under applicable regulations was $18.3 million, or 15% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus.  At June 30, 2019, the Bank had no loans or group of loans to related borrowers with outstanding balances in excess of this amount.  The Bank’s five largest lending relationships at June 30, 2019 consisted of: one commercial real estate loan totaling $5.8 million to one group of borrowers; two multi-family loans totaling $4.6 million to one group of borrowers; two single-family loans totaling $4.5 million to one group of borrowers; one multi-family and one commercial real estate loan totaling $4.4 million to one group of borrowers; and one commercial real estate loan totaling $4.3 million to one group of borrowers.  The real estate collateral for these loans is located in Southern California.  At June 30, 2019, all of these loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms.
 
On February 4, 2019, the Corporation announced that it was in the best interests of the Corporation to scale back the saleable single-family mortgage loan originations and improve on its efforts to increase the volume of portfolio single-family mortgage loan originations and purchases. For additional information, see “Loan Originations” and “Critical Accounting Policies” in this Form 10-K.

Maturity of Loans Held for Investment.  The following table sets forth information at June 30, 2019 regarding the dollar amount of principal payments becoming contractually due during the periods indicated for loans held for investment.  Demand loans, loans having no stated schedule of principal payments, loans having no stated maturity, and overdrafts are reported as becoming due within one year.  The table does not include any estimate of prepayments, which can significantly shorten the average life of loans held for investment and may cause the Bank’s actual principal payment experience to differ materially from that shown below:

Scheduled contractual principal payments of loans do not reflect the actual life of such assets.  The average life of loans is generally substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments.  In addition, due-on-sale clauses generally give the Bank the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, the borrower sells the real property that secures the loan.  The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase, however, when current market interest rates are substantially higher than the interest rates on existing loans held for investment and, conversely, decrease when the interest rates on existing loans held for investment are substantially higher than current market interest rates, as borrowers are generally less inclined to refinance their loans when market rates increase and more inclined to refinance their loans when market rates decrease.

----+------------------------------

Single-Family Mortgage Loans.  One of the Bank’s primary lending activity is the origination and purchase of adjustable rate mortgage loans to be held for investment secured by first mortgages on owner-occupied, single-family (one to four units) residences in the communities where the Bank has established full service branches and surrounding areas in Southern and Northern California.  During fiscal 2019 the Bank originated $55.4 million and purchased $33.3 million of single-family loans to be held for investment, all of which were underwritten in accordance with the Bank’s origination guidelines. This compares to loan originations of $90.4 million and no loan purchases during fiscal 2018. Additional lending activities have included originating saleable single-family loans, primarily fixed-rate first mortgages. At June 30, 2019, total single-family loans held for investment increased slightly to $325.0 million, or 36.9% of the total loans held for investment, from $314.8 million, or 34.8% of the total loans held for investment, at June 30, 2018.  The slight increase in the single-family loans in fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to new loans originated and purchased for investment, partly offset by loan principal payments. During fiscal 2019, the Bank had net recoveries of $167,000 in non-performing single-family loans, as compared to net charge-offs of $114,000 during fiscal 2018.  At June 30, 2019 and 2018, total non-performing single-family loans were $5.2 million and $6.0 million, net of allowances and charge-offs, respectively, and $660,000 and $804,000 were past due 30 to 89 days, respectively.
 
The Bank has underwriting standards that require verified documentation of income and assets from borrowers and our underwriting generally conforms to agency mandated credit score requirements.  Generally, mortgage insurance is required on all loans exceeding 80% loan-to-value based on the lower of purchase price or appraised value at the time of loan origination.  Loan-to-value (“LTV”) is the ratio derived by dividing the original loan balance by the lower of the original appraised value or purchase price of the real estate collateral.  The maximum allowable loan-to-value is 97% on a purchase transaction for conventional financing with mortgage insurance and 96.5% loan-to-value for FHA financing with mortgage

insurance.  Second home purchases and rate and term refinance transactions are capped at 90% loan-to-value with mortgage insurance.  Non-owner occupied purchase and rate and term refinance transactions are capped at 80% loan-to-value while non-owner occupied refinance cash-out transactions are capped at 75% loan-to-value.  We manage our underwriting standards, loan-to-value ratios and credit standards to the currently required agency and investor policies and guidelines.  These standards may change at any time, given changes in real estate market conditions, secondary mortgage market requirements and changes to investor policies and guidelines.
 
The Bank offers closed-end, fixed-rate home equity loans that are secured by the borrower’s primary residence.  These loans do not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the residence and have terms of up to 15 years requiring monthly payments of principal and interest.  At June 30, 2019, home equity loans amounted to $11.0 million or 3.4% of single-family loans held for investment, as compared to $14.1 million or 4.5% of single-family loans held for investment at June 30, 2018.
 
The Bank offers adjustable rate mortgage (“ARM”) loans at rates and terms competitive with market conditions. Substantially all of the ARM loans originated by the Bank meet the underwriting standards of the secondary market.  The Bank offers several ARM products, which adjust monthly, semi-annually, or annually after an initial fixed period ranging from one month to ten years subject to a limitation on the annual increase of one to two percentage points and an overall limitation of three to six percentage points.  The following indexes, plus a margin of 2.00% to 3.25%, are used to calculate the periodic interest rate changes: the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), the FHLB Eleventh District cost of funds (“COFI”), the 12-month average U.S. Treasury (“12 MAT”) or the weekly average yield on one year U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year (“CMT”).  Loans based on the LIBOR index constitute a majority of the Bank’s loans held for investment.  The majority of the ARM loans held for investment have five or seven-year fixed periods prior to the first adjustment (“5/1 or 7/1 hybrids”) and provide for fully amortizing loan payments throughout the term of the loan.  Loans of this type have embedded interest rate risk if interest rates should rise during the initial fixed rate period.
 
Prior to fiscal 2009, the Bank offered stated income single-family mortgage loans.  As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the outstanding balance of the stated income single-family mortgage loans was $52.6 million and $72.0 million, respectively, of which $2.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively were non-performing, while $660,000 were 30-89 days delinquent at June 30, 2019 and none were 30-89 days delinquent at June 30, 2018.
 
Borrower demand for ARM loans versus fixed-rate mortgage loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates and the difference between the initial interest rates and fees charged for each type of loan.  The relative amount of fixed-rate mortgage loans and ARM loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each product in a given interest rate and competitive environment. Given the recent market environment, the production of ARM loans was lower as compared to fixed rate mortgages.
 
The retention of ARM loans, rather than fixed-rate loans, helps to reduce the Bank’s exposure to changes in interest rates.  There is, however, unquantifiable credit risk resulting from the potential of increased interest charges to be paid by the borrower as a result of increases in interest rates.  It is possible that, during periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on ARM loans may increase as a result of the increase in the required payment from the borrower.  Furthermore, the risk of default may increase because ARM loans originated by the Bank occasionally provide, as a marketing incentive, for initial rates of interest below those rates that would apply if the adjustment index plus the applicable margin were initially used for pricing.  Because of these characteristics, ARM loans are subject to increased risks of default or delinquency.  Additionally, while ARM loans allow the Bank to decrease the sensitivity of its assets as a result of changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest rate sensitivity is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits.  Furthermore, because loan indexes may not respond perfectly to changes in market interest rates, upward adjustments on loans may occur more slowly than increases in the Bank’s cost of interest-bearing liabilities, especially during periods of rapidly increasing interest rates.  Because of these characteristics, the Bank has no assurance that yields on ARM loans will be sufficient to offset increases in the Bank’s cost of funds.
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) requires lenders to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a borrower’s ability to repay any consumer closed-end credit transaction secured by a

dwelling and to limit prepayment penalties.  Increased risks of legal challenge, private right of action and regulatory enforcement actions result from these rules. The Bank originates an immaterial number of loans that do not meet the definition of a “qualified mortgage” (“QM”). To mitigate the risks involved with non-QM loans, the Bank has implemented systems, processes, procedural and product changes, and maintains its underwriting standards, to ensure that the “ability-to-repay” requirements of the new rules are adequately addressed.
 
A decline in real estate values subsequent to the time of origination of real estate secured loans could result in higher loan delinquency levels, foreclosures, provisions for loan losses and net charge-offs.  Real estate values and real estate markets are beyond the Bank’s control and are generally affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and other factors.  These factors include fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, housing supply and demand, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies and acts of nature, such as earthquakes, fires and other natural disasters particular to California where substantially all of our real estate collateral is located.  If real estate values decline from the levels at the time of loan origination, the value of our real estate collateral securing the loans could be significantly reduced.  The Bank’s ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and it would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans.
 
Multi-Family and Commercial Real Estate Mortgage Loans.  At June 30, 2019, multi-family mortgage loans were $439.0 million and commercial real estate loans were $111.9 million, or 49.8% and 12.7%, respectively, of loans held for investment.  This compares to multi-family mortgage loans of $476.0 million and commercial real estate loans of $109.7 million, or 52.6% and 12.1%, respectively, of loans held for investment at June 30, 2018.  Consistent with its strategy to diversify the composition of loans held for investment, the Bank has made the origination and purchase of multi-family and commercial real estate loans a priority.  During fiscal 2019 the Bank originated $57.6 million and purchased $17.8 million of multi-family and commercial real estate loans, all of which were underwritten in accordance with the Bank’s origination guidelines.  This compares to loan originations of $91.1 million and loan purchases of $13.5 million during fiscal 2018.  At June 30, 2019, the Bank had 644 multi-family and 146 commercial real estate loans in loans held for investment.
 
Multi-family mortgage loans originated by the Bank are predominately adjustable rate loans, including 1/1, 3/1, 5/1 and 7/1 hybrids, with a term to maturity of 10 to 30 years and a 25 to 30 year amortization schedule.  Commercial real estate loans originated by the Bank are also predominately adjustable rate loans, including 1/1, 3/1 and 5/1 hybrids, with a term to maturity of 10 to 30 years and a 25 to 30 year amortization schedule.  Rates on multi-family and commercial real estate ARM loans generally adjust monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually at a specific margin over the respective interest rate index, subject to period interest rate caps and life-of-loan interest rate caps.  At June 30, 2019, $413.8 million, or 94.3%, of the Bank’s multi-family loans were secured by five to 36 unit projects.  The Bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio generally consists of loans secured by small office buildings, light industrial buildings, warehouses and small retail centers.  Properties securing multi-family and commercial real estate loans are primarily located in Alameda, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco and Santa Clara counties.  The Bank originates multi-family and commercial real estate loans in amounts typically ranging from $350,000 to $6.0 million.  At June 30, 2019, the Bank had 52 commercial real estate and multi-family loans with principal balances greater than $1.5 million totaling $117.6 million.  The Bank obtains appraisals on all properties that secure multi-family and commercial real estate loans.  Underwriting of multi-family and commercial real estate loans includes, among other considerations, a thorough analysis of the cash flows generated by the property to support the debt service and the financial resources, experience and the income level of the borrowers and guarantors.
 
Multi-family and commercial real estate loans afford the Bank an opportunity to price the loans with higher interest rates than those generally available from single-family mortgage loans.  However, loans secured by such properties are generally greater in amount, more difficult to evaluate and monitor and are more susceptible to default as a result of general economic conditions and, therefore, involve a greater degree of risk than single-family residential mortgage loans.  Because payments on loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be impacted by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.  During both fiscal 2019 and 2018, the Bank had no charge-offs or recoveries on non-performing multi-family and commercial real estate loans.  At June 30, 2019 or 2018, there were no non-performing multi-family and commercial real estate

 loans and none were past due 30 to 89 days.  Non-performing loans and/or delinquent loans may increase if there is a general decline in California real estate markets and in the event poor general economic conditions prevail. 
 
Construction Mortgage Loans.  The Bank originates from time to time two types of construction loans: short-term construction loans and construction/permanent loans.  During fiscal 2019 and 2018, the Bank originated a total of $7.2 million and $4.7 million of construction loans (including undisbursed loan funds), respectively.  As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Bank had short-term construction loans totaling $4.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, and construction/permanent loans totaling $410,000 and $0, respectively, net of undisbursed loan funds of $6.6 million and $4.3 million, respectively. 
Short-term construction loans include three types of loans: custom construction, tract construction, and speculative construction.  Additionally, from time to time, the Bank makes short-term (18 to 36 month) lot loans to facilitate land acquisition prior to the start of construction.  At June 30, 2019, lot loans totaled $167,000. The Bank provides construction financing for single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate properties.  Custom construction loans are made to individuals who, at the time of application, have a contract executed with a builder to construct their residence.  Custom construction loans are generally originated for a term of 12 to 18 months, with fixed interest rates at the prime lending rate plus a margin and with loan-to-value ratios of up to 75% of the appraised value of the completed property.  The owner secures long-term permanent financing at the completion of construction. At June 30, 2019, there were two custom single-family construction loans totaling $1.7 million with $1.2 million of undisbursed funds. This compares to June 30, 2018 when the Bank had two custom single-family construction loans totaling $1.6 million with $916,000 of undisbursed funds.
 
The Bank makes tract construction loans to subdivision builders.  These subdivisions are usually financed and built in phases.  A thorough analysis of market trends and demand within the area are reviewed for feasibility.  Tract construction may include the building and financing of model homes under a separate loan.  The terms for tract construction loans are generally 12 months with interest rates fixed at a margin above the prime lending rate.  At June 30, 2019, there were no tract construction loans.
 
Speculative construction loans are made to home builders and are termed “speculative” because the home builder does not have, at the time of loan origination, a signed sale contract with a home buyer who has a commitment for permanent financing with either the Bank or another lender for the finished home.  The home buyer may be identified during or after the construction period.  The builder may be required to debt service the speculative construction loan for a significant period of time after the completion of construction until the homebuyer is identified.  At June 30, 2019, there was one single-family speculative construction loan of $716,000 with $529,000 of undisbursed funds. This compares to June 30, 2018 when the Bank  had two single-family speculative construction loans totaling $1.1 million with $122,000 of undisbursed funds.
 
Construction/permanent loans automatically roll from the construction to the permanent phase.  The construction phase of a construction/permanent loan generally lasts nine to 12 months and the interest rate charged is generally fixed at a margin above prime rate and with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 75% of the appraised value of the completed property.  At June 30, 2019, there was $410,000 of construction/permanent loans and there were no construction/permanent loans at June 30, 2018.
 
Construction loans under $1.0 million are approved by Bank personnel specifically designated to approve construction loans.  The Bank’s Loan Committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President – Single-Family Division and Vice President - Loan Administration, approves all construction loans over $1.0 million.  Prior to approval of any construction loan, an independent fee appraiser inspects the site and the Bank reviews the existing or proposed improvements, identifies the market for the proposed project, and analyzes the pro-forma data and assumptions on the project.  In the case of a tract or speculative construction loan, the Bank reviews the experience and expertise of the builder.  The Bank obtains credit reports, financial statements and tax returns on the borrowers and guarantors, an independent appraisal of the project, and any other expert report necessary to evaluate the proposed project.  In the event of cost overruns, the Bank requires the borrower to deposit their own funds into a loan-in-process account, which the Bank disburses consistent with the completion of the subject property pursuant to a revised disbursement schedule.

The construction loan documents require that construction loan proceeds be disbursed in increments as construction progresses.  Disbursements are based on periodic on-site inspections by independent inspectors and Bank personnel.  At inception, the Bank also requires borrowers to deposit funds into the loan-in-process account covering the difference between the actual cost of construction and the loan amount.  The Bank regularly monitors the construction loan portfolio, economic conditions and housing inventory.  The Bank’s property inspectors perform periodic inspections.  The Bank believes that the internal monitoring system helps reduce many of the risks inherent in its construction loans. 

 
Construction loans afford the Bank the opportunity to achieve higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than its single-family mortgage loans.  Construction loans, however, are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than single-family mortgage loans because of the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property’s value at completion of the project and the cost of the project.  The nature of these loans is such that they are generally more difficult to evaluate and monitor.  If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project.  If the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be confronted with a project whose value is insufficient to assure full repayment.  Projects may also be jeopardized by disagreements between borrowers and builders and by the failure of builders to pay subcontractors.  Loans to builders to construct homes for which no purchaser has been identified carry additional risk because the payoff for the loan depends on the builder’s ability to sell the property prior to the time that the construction loan matures.  The Bank has sought to address these risks by adhering to strict underwriting policies, disbursement procedures and monitoring practices.  In addition, because the Bank’s construction lending is in its primary market area, changes in the local or regional economy and real estate market could adversely affect the Bank’s construction loans held for investment. During fiscal 2019, the Bank had no charge-offs or recoveries, but had one loan totaling $971,000 that was non-performing and no loans were 30-89 days delinquent at June 30, 2019. During fiscal 2018, the Bank had no charge-offs or recoveries and no loans were non-performing or 30-89 days delinquent at June 30, 2018.
 
Participation Loan Purchases and Sales.  In an effort to expand production and diversify risk, the Bank purchases loans and loan participations, with collateral primarily in California, which allows for greater geographic distribution outside of the Bank’s primary lending areas.  The Bank generally purchases between 50% and 100% of the total loan amount. When the Bank purchases a participation loan, the lead lender will usually retain a servicing fee, thereby decreasing the loan yield.  This servicing fee approximates the expense the Bank would incur if the Bank were to service the loan.  All properties serving as collateral for loan participations are inspected by an employee of the Bank or a third party inspection service prior to being approved by the Loan Committee and the Bank relies upon the same underwriting criteria required for those loans originated by the Bank.  The Bank purchased $51.1 million of loans to be held for investment (primarily single-family and multi-family loans) in fiscal 2019, compared to $13.5 million of purchased loans to be held for investment (primarily multi-family loans) in fiscal 2018.  As of June 30, 2019, total loans serviced by other financial institutions were $33.9 million, as compared to $20.5 million at June 30, 2018.  As of June 30, 2019, all loans serviced by others were performing according to their contractual payment terms.
 
The Bank also sells participating interests in loans when it has been determined that it is beneficial to diversify the Bank’s risk.  Participation sales enable the Bank to maintain acceptable loan concentrations and comply with the Bank’s loans to one borrower policy.  Generally, selling a participating interest in a loan increases the yield to the Bank on the portion of the loan that is retained.  The Bank did not sell any participation loans in fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018.
 
Commercial Business Loans.  The Bank has a Business Banking Department that primarily serves businesses located within the Inland Empire.  Commercial business loans allow the Bank to diversify its lending and increase the average loan yield.  As of June 30, 2019, commercial business loans were $478,000, or 0.1% of loans held for investment, a decrease of $22,000, or 4%, during fiscal 2019 from $500,000, or 0.1% of loans held for investment at June 30, 2018.  These loans represent secured and unsecured lines of credit and term loans secured by business assets.
 
Commercial business loans are generally made to customers who are well known to the Bank and are generally secured by accounts receivable, inventory, business equipment and/or other assets.  The Bank’s commercial business loans may be structured as term loans or as lines of credit.  Lines of credit are made at variable rates of interest equal to a negotiated margin 
 
 10
  
above the prime rate and term loans are at a fixed or variable rate.  The Bank may also require personal guarantees from financially capable parties associated with the business based on a review of personal financial statements.  Commercial business term loans are generally made to finance the purchase of assets and have maturities of five years or less.  Commercial lines of credit are typically made for the purpose of providing working capital and are usually approved with a term of one year or less.  
 Commercial business loans involve greater risk than residential mortgage loans and involve risks that are different from those associated with residential and commercial real estate loans.  Real estate loans are generally considered to be collateral based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral value and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral is viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default.  Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets including real estate, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may not be collectible and inventories and equipment may be obsolete or of limited use.  Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial business loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is secondary and oftentimes an insufficient source of repayment.  At June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Bank had $41,000 and $64,000 of non-performing commercial business loans, respectively, net of allowances and charge-offs.  During fiscal 2019 or 2018, the Bank had no charge-offs or recoveries on commercial business loans. 
Consumer Loans.  At June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Bank’s consumer loans were $134,000 and $109,000, respectively, or less than 0.1% of the Bank’s loans held for investment at these dates.  The Bank offers open-ended lines of credit on either a secured or unsecured basis.  The Bank offers secured savings lines of credit which have an interest rate that is four percentage points above the COFI, which adjusts monthly.  Secured savings lines of credit at June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $0 and $3,000, respectively.
 
Consumer loans potentially have a greater risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of loans that are unsecured.  Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s ongoing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, illness or personal bankruptcy.  Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.  The Bank had no non-performing consumer loans at June 30, 2019 and 2018.  During fiscal 2019, the Bank had $1,000 of net charge-offs on consumer loans, as compared to net charge-offs of $4,000 during fiscal 2018.
 
Loans Originations, Purchases, Sales and Repayments
 
The Bank’s saleable single-family loans are generally underwritten and documented in accordance with guidelines established by institutional loan buyers, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) (collectively, “the secondary market”).  All conforming agency loans are generally underwritten and documented in accordance with the guidelines established by these secondary market purchasers, as well as the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), FHA and the Veterans’ Administration (“VA”).  Loans are normally classified as either conforming (meeting agency criteria) or non-conforming (meeting an institutional investor’s criteria).  Non-conforming loans are typically those that exceed agency loan limits but closely mirror agency underwriting criteria. The non-conforming loans may be underwritten to expanded guidelines allowing a borrower with good credit a broader range of product choices.
 
Mortgage loans are originated for both investment and sale to the secondary market.  The Corporation is primarily a single-family ARM lender for its own portfolio. Prior to scaling back originations of saleable single-family fixed-rate mortgage loans during fiscal 2019, a large amount of single-family fixed-rate mortgage loans were originated for sale to institutional investors. Mortgage loans sold to investors generally are sold without recourse other than standard representations and warranties.  Generally, mortgage loans sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are sold on a non-recourse basis and foreclosure losses are generally the responsibility of the purchaser and not the Bank, except in the case of FHA and VA loans used to form Government National Mortgage Association pools, which are subject to limitations on the FHA’s and VA’s loan guarantees. For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” under the subheading “Loans originated and held for sale.”

Loan Servicing
 
The Bank receives fees from a variety of investors in return for performing the traditional services of collecting individual loan payments on loans sold by the Bank to such investors.  At June 30, 2019, the Bank was servicing $120.2 million of loans for others, a 6% decrease from $128.4 million at June 30, 2018.  The decrease was primarily attributable to loan prepayments, partly offset by loans sold with servicing retained during fiscal 2019.  Loan servicing includes processing payments, accounting
 
 12

 
 for loan funds and collecting and paying real estate taxes, hazard insurance and other loan-related items such as private mortgage insurance. After the Bank receives the gross mortgage payment from individual borrowers, it remits to the investor a predetermined net amount based on the loan sale agreement for that mortgage.
 
Servicing assets are amortized in proportion to and over the period of the estimated net servicing income and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value.  The fair value of servicing assets is determined by calculating the present value of the estimated net future cash flows consistent with contractually specified servicing fees.  The Bank periodically evaluates servicing assets for impairment, which is measured as the excess of cost over fair value.  This review is performed on a disaggregated basis, based on loan type and interest rate.  Generally, loan servicing becomes more valuable when interest rates rise (as prepayments typically decrease) and less valuable when interest rates decline (as prepayments typically increase).  In estimating fair values at June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Bank used a weighted average Constant Prepayment Rate (“CPR”) of 23.86% and 13.42%, respectively, and a weighted-average discount rate of 9.11% and 9.11%, respectively.  The required impairment reserve against servicing assets at June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $298,000 and $82,000, respectively.  In aggregate, servicing assets had a carrying value of $925,000 and a fair value of $627,000 at June 30, 2019, compared to a carrying value of $998,000 and a fair value of $1.0 million at June 30, 2018.
 

Delinquencies and Classified Assets
 
Delinquent Loans.  When a mortgage loan borrower fails to make a required payment when due, the Bank initiates collection procedures.  In most cases, delinquencies are cured promptly; however, if the loan remains delinquent on the 120th day for single-family loans or the 90th day for other loans, or sooner if the borrower is chronically delinquent, and after all reasonable means of obtaining the payment have been exhausted, foreclosure proceedings, according to the terms of the security instrument and applicable law, are initiated.  Interest income is reduced by the full amount of accrued and uncollected interest on such loans.
 
The following table sets forth delinquencies in the Bank’s loans held for investment as of the dates indicated, gross of collectively and individually evaluated allowances, if any:

As of June 30, 2019, total non-performing assets, net of allowance for loan losses and fair value adjustments, were $6.2 million, or 0.57% of total assets, which was primarily comprised of: 20 single-family loans ($5.2 million); one construction loan ($971,000); one commercial business loan ($41,000); and no REO.  As of June 30, 2019, 70%, or $4.4 million of non-performing loans had a current payment status. This compares to total non-performing assets, net of allowance for loan losses and fair value adjustments, of $7.0 million, or 0.59% of total assets, with $2.9 million, or 48%, of non-performing loans with a current payment status at June 30, 2018.

The Bank assesses loans individually and classifies the loans as non-performing and substandard in accordance with regulatory requirements when the accrual of interest has been discontinued, loans have been restructured or management has serious doubts about the future collectibility of principal and interest, even though the loans are currently performing.  Factors considered in determining classification include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, collateral value, the financial condition of the borrower and current economic conditions. The Bank measures each non-performing loan based on ASC 310, “Receivables,” establishes a collectively evaluated or individually evaluated allowance and charges off those loans or portions of loans deemed uncollectible.

Restructured Loans.  A troubled debt restructuring is a loan which the Bank, for reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Bank would not otherwise consider.
 
The loan terms which have been modified or restructured due to a borrower’s financial difficulty, include but are not limited to:
 a)  A reduction in the stated interest rate.
 b)  An extension of the maturity at an interest rate below market.
 c)  A reduction in the accrued interest.
 d)  Extensions, deferrals, renewals and rewrites.
 
To qualify for restructuring, a borrower must provide evidence of their creditworthiness such as, current financial statements, their most recent income tax returns, current paystubs, current W-2s, and most recent bank statements, among other documents, which are then verified by the Bank.  The Bank re-underwrites the loan with the borrower’s updated financial information, new credit report, current loan balance, new interest rate, remaining loan term, updated property value and modified payment schedule, among other considerations, to determine if the borrower qualifies.
 
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, there were no loans that were newly modified from their original terms, re-underwritten or identified as a restructured loan; one loan (previously modified) was downgraded; while three loans were upgraded to the pass category; one loan was paid off; and no loans were converted to REO.  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, there were two loans that were newly modified from their original terms, re-underwritten or identified as a restructured loan, two loans (previously modified) were downgraded, while two loans were upgraded to the pass category and one loan was converted to REO.  During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, no restructured loans were in default within a 12-month period subsequent to their original restructuring.  Additionally, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, there was one restructured loan of $56,000 that was extended beyond the initial maturity of the modification; while in fiscal 2018, there were no restructured loans that were extended beyond the initial maturity of the modification.
 
As of June 30, 2019, the net outstanding balance of the Corporation’s eight restructured loans was $3.8 million:  one was classified as special mention and remains on accrual status ($437,000); one was classified as substandard on accrual status ($1.4 million); and six were classified as substandard on non-accrual status ($1.9 million).  As of June 30, 2019, $2.4 million, or 63 percent, of the restructured loans were current with respect to their payment status.  As of June 30, 2018, the net outstanding balance of the Corporation’s 11 restructured loans was $5.2 million: one loan was classified as special mention on accrual status ($389,000); one was classified as substandard on accrual status ($1.4 million); and nine loans were classified as substandard ($3.4 million, all on non-accrual status).  As of June 30, 2018, $2.9 million, or 56 percent, of the restructured loans had a current payment status, consistent with their modified terms. 
 
The Bank upgrades restructured single-family loans to the pass category if the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory contractual payments for at least six consecutive months or 12 months for those loans that were restructured more than once and there is a reasonable assurance that the payments will continue.  Once the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory contractual payments beyond 12 consecutive months, the loan is no longer categorized as a restructured loan.
 
Other Loans of Concern.  As of June 30, 2019, $8.6 million of loans which were not disclosed as non-performing loans were classified as special mention because known information about possible credit problems of the borrowers causes management to have some doubt as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms.  Of these loans, $3.8 million were single-family mortgage loans, $3.9 million were multi-family mortgage loans and $927,000 was a commercial real estate loan.  As of June 30, 2018, $7.5 million of loans which were not disclosed as non-performing loans were classified by the Bank as special mention for the same reasons.  In addition, as of June 30, 2019, total substandard loans were $7.6 million of which $6.2 million were classified as non-performing loans; while as of June 30, 2018, total substandard loans were $7.4 million of which $6.1 million were classified as non-performing loans.
Foreclosed Real Estate.  Real estate acquired by the Bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as REO until it is sold.  When a property is acquired, it is recorded at its fair market value less the estimated cost of sale.  Subsequent declines in value are charged to operations.  As of June 30, 2019, there was no REO property, compared to 
  15

 
$906,000 consisting of two single-family properties located in California at June 30, 2018.  In managing the real estate owned properties for quick disposition, the Bank completes the necessary repairs and maintenance to the individual properties before listing for sale, obtains new appraisals and broker price opinions (“BPO”) to determine current market listing prices, and engages local realtors who are most familiar with real estate sub-markets, among other techniques, which generally results in the quick disposition of real estate owned.
 
Asset Classification.  The OCC has adopted various regulations regarding the problem assets of savings institutions.  The regulations require that each institution review and classify its assets on a regular basis.  In addition, in connection with examinations of institutions, OCC examiners have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified.  There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss.  Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss.  An asset classified as a loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted.  If an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss, the institution establishes an individually evaluated allowance and may subsequently charge-off the amount of the asset classified as loss.  A portion of the allowance for loan losses established to cover probable losses related to assets classified substandard or doubtful may be included in determining an institution’s regulatory capital.  Assets that do not currently expose the institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention and are closely monitored by the Bank.
 
Classified assets increased 3% to $16.2 million at June 30, 2019 from $15.8 million at June 30, 2018. The aggregate amounts of the Bank’s classified assets are primarily located in California.

Not all of the Bank’s classified assets are delinquent or non-performing.  In determining whether the Bank’s assets expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification, the Bank may consider various factors, including the payment history of the borrower, the loan-to-value ratio, and the debt coverage ratio of the property securing the loan.  After consideration of these factors, the Bank may determine that the asset in question, though not currently delinquent, presents a risk of loss that requires it to be classified or designated as special mention.  In addition, the Bank’s loans held for investment may include single-family, commercial and multi-family real estate loans with a balance exceeding the current market value of the collateral which are not classified because they are performing and have borrowers who have sufficient resources to support the repayment of the loan.
 
Allowance for Loan Losses.  The allowance for loan losses is maintained to cover losses inherent in the loans held for investment.  In originating loans, the Bank recognizes that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with, among other factors, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan, general economic conditions and, in the case of a secured loan, the quality of the collateral securing the loan. The responsibility for the review of the Bank’s assets and the determination of the adequacy of the allowance lies with the Internal Asset Review Committee (“IAR Committee”).  The Bank adjusts its allowance for loan losses by charging (crediting) its provision (recovery) for loan losses against the Bank’s operations.
 
The Bank has established a methodology for the determination of the provision for loan losses.  The methodology is set forth in a formal policy and takes into consideration the need for a collectively evaluated allowance for groups of homogeneous loans 
 
 17

 
and an individually evaluated allowance that are tied to individual problem loans.  The Bank’s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements.
 
The allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to the loans held for investment. The loss factors are applied according to loan program type and loan classification.  The loss factors for each program type and loan classification are established based on an evaluation of the historical loss experience, prevailing market conditions, concentration in loan types and other relevant factors consistent with ASC 450, “Contingency”.  Homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage, home equity and consumer installment loans are considered on a pooled loan basis.  A factor is assigned to each pool based upon expected charge-offs for one year.   The factors for larger, less homogeneous loans, such as construction and commercial real estate loans, are based upon loss experience tracked over business cycles considered appropriate for the loan type.
 
Collectively evaluated or individually evaluated allowances are established to absorb losses on loans for which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured as prescribed in ASC 310.  Estimates of identifiable losses are reviewed continually and, generally, a provision (recovery) for losses is charged (credited) against operations on a quarterly basis as necessary to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level.  Management presents the minutes summarizing the actions of the IAR Committee to the Bank’s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.
 
Non-performing loans are charged-off to their fair market values in the period the loans, or portion thereof, are deemed uncollectible, generally after the loan becomes 150 days delinquent for real estate secured first trust deed loans and 120 days delinquent for commercial business or real estate secured second trust deed loans.  For restructured loans, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent; and where borrowers file bankruptcy, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes 60 days delinquent.  The amount of the charge-off is determined by comparing the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less disposition costs, with the loan balance in excess of the estimated fair value charged-off against the allowance for loan losses.  The allowance for loan losses for non-performing loans is determined by applying Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 310, “Receivables.”  For restructured loans that are less than 90 days delinquent, the allowance for loan losses are segregated into (a) individually evaluated allowances for those loans with applicable discounted cash flow calculations still in their restructuring period, classified lower than pass, and containing an embedded loss component or (b) collectively evaluated allowances based on the aggregated pooling method.  For non-performing loans less than 60 days delinquent where the borrower has filed bankruptcy, the collectively evaluated allowances are assigned based on the aggregated pooling method.  For non-performing commercial real estate loans, an individually evaluated allowance is calculated based on the loan's fair value and if the fair value is higher than the loan balance, no allowance is required.
 
The IAR Committee meets quarterly to review and monitor conditions in the portfolio and to determine the appropriate allowance for loan losses.  To the extent that any of these conditions are apparent by identifiable problem loans or portfolio segments as of the evaluation date, the IAR Committee’s estimate of the effect of such conditions may be reflected as an individually evaluated allowance applicable to such loans or portfolio segments.  Where any of these conditions is not apparent by specifically identifiable problem loans or portfolio segments as of the evaluation date, the IAR Committee’s evaluation of the probable loss related to such condition is reflected in the general allowance.  The intent of the IAR Committee is to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses.  Pooled loan factors are adjusted to reflect current estimates of charge-offs for the subsequent 12 months.  Loss activity is reviewed for non-pooled loans and the loss factors are adjusted, if necessary.   By assessing the probable estimated losses inherent in the loans held for investment on a quarterly basis, the Bank is able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates based upon the most recent information that has become available.
 
At June 30, 2019, the Bank had an allowance for loan losses of $7.1 million, or 0.80% of gross loans held for investment, compared to an allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2018 of $7.4 million, or 0.81% of gross loans held for investment. A $475,000 recovery from the allowance for loan losses was recorded in fiscal 2019, compared to a $536,000 recovery from the allowance for loan losses in fiscal 2018.  Although management believes the best information available is used to make such (recovery) provision, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations.
 
18

 
While the Bank believes that it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with GAAP, there can be no assurance that regulators, in reviewing the Bank’s loan portfolio, will not recommend that the Bank significantly increase its allowance for loan losses.  In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above.  Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect the Bank’s financial condition and results of operations.
 
The following table sets forth an analysis of the Bank’s allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.  Where individually evaluated allowances have been established, any differences between the individually evaluated allowances and the amount of loss realized has been charged or credited to current operations.

The following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the periods indicated.  Management believes that the allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis.  The allocation of the allowance is based upon an asset classification matrix. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance in one category to absorb losses in any other categories.

Investment Securities Activities
 
Federally chartered savings institutions are permitted under federal and state laws to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies and government sponsored enterprises and of state and municipal governments, deposits at the FHLB, certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, certain bankers’ acceptances, mortgage-backed securities and federal funds.  Subject to various restrictions, federally chartered savings institutions may also invest a portion of their assets in commercial paper and corporate debt securities.  Savings institutions such as the Bank are also required to maintain an investment in FHLB – San Francisco stock.
 
The investment policy of the Bank, established by the Board of Directors and implemented by the Bank’s Asset-Liability Committee, seeks to provide and maintain adequate liquidity, complement the Bank’s lending activities, and generate a favorable return on investment without incurring undue interest rate risk or credit risk.  Investments are made based on certain considerations, such as credit quality, yield, maturity, liquidity and marketability. The Bank also considers the effect that the proposed investment would have on the Bank’s risk-based capital requirements and interest rate risk sensitivity.
 
At June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Bank’s investment securities portfolio was $100.1 million and $95.3 million, respectively, which primarily consisted of federal agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations.  The Bank’s investment securities portfolio was classified as held to maturity and available for sale.  The Corporation purchased held to maturity mortgage-backed securities totaling $39.7 million and $53.9 million during fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds
 
General.  Deposits, loan repayments and the proceeds from loan sales are the major sources of the Bank’s funds for lending and other investment purposes.  Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are influenced significantly by general interest rates and money market conditions.  Loan sales are also influenced significantly by general interest rates. Borrowings through the FHLB – San Francisco and repurchase agreements may be used to compensate for declines in the availability of funds from other sources.
Deposit Accounts.  Substantially all of the Bank’s depositors are residents of the State of California.  Deposits are attracted from within the Bank’s market area by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments, including checking, savings, money market and time deposits.  Deposit account terms vary, differentiated by the minimum balance required, the time periods that the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of its deposit accounts, the Bank considers current interest rates, profitability to the Bank, interest rate risk characteristics, competition and its customers’ preferences and concerns.  Generally, the Bank’s deposit rates are commensurate with the median rates of its competitors within a given market.  The Bank may occasionally pay above-market interest rates to attract or retain deposits when less expensive sources of funds are not available.  The Bank may also pay above-market interest rates in specific markets in order to increase the deposit base of a particular office or group of offices.  The Bank reviews its deposit composition and pricing on a weekly basis.
 
The Bank generally offers time deposits for terms not exceeding seven years.  As illustrated in the following table, time deposits represented 23% of the Bank’s deposit portfolio at June 30, 2019, compared to 26% at June 30, 2018.  As of June 30, 2019, there were no brokered deposits.  At June 30, 2018, total brokered deposits were $1.6 million with a weighted average interest rate of 3.88% and remaining maturities within one year.  The Bank attempts to reduce the overall cost of its deposit portfolio and to increase its franchise value by emphasizing transaction accounts, which are subject to a heightened degree of competition.  For additional information, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Form 10-K.

Borrowings.  The FHLB – San Francisco functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions.  As a member, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB – San Francisco and is authorized to apply for advances using such stock and certain of its mortgage loans and other assets (principally investment securities) as collateral, provided certain creditworthiness standards have been met.  Advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs.  Each credit program has its own interest rate, maturity, terms and conditions.  Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit.  The Bank utilizes advances from the FHLB – San Francisco as an alternative to deposits to supplement its supply of lendable funds, to meet deposit withdrawal requirements and to help manage interest rate risk.  The FHLB – San Francisco has, from time to time, served as the Bank’s primary borrowing source.  As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the FHLB – San Francisco borrowing capacity was limited to 35% of the Bank’s total assets at both dates, amounting to $391.8 million and $411.8 million, respectively.  Advances from the FHLB – San Francisco are typically secured by the Bank’s single-family residential, multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage loans.  Total mortgage loans pledged to the FHLB – San Francisco were $643.0 million at June 30, 2019 as compared to $746.7 million at June 30, 2018.  In addition, the Bank pledged investment securities totaling $3.2 million at June 30, 2019 as compared to $3.3 million at June 30, 2018 to collateralize its FHLB – San Francisco advances under the Securities-Backed Credit (“SBC”) facility.  At June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Bank had $101.1 million and $126.2 million of borrowings, respectively, from the FHLB – San Francisco with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.62% and 2.47%, respectively.  At June 30, 2019, the outstanding borrowings mature between 2020 and 2025 with a weighted average maturity of 44 months.  In addition to the total borrowings mentioned above, the Bank utilized its borrowing facility for letters of credit and MPF credit enhancement.  The outstanding letters of credit at June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $13.0 million and $8.0 million, respectively; and the outstanding MPF credit enhancement was $2.5 million at both dates.  For additional information, see Note 8 to the Corporation’s audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the remaining financing availability was $275.2 million and $275.1 million, respectively, with remaining available collateral of $434.7 million and $500.3 million, respectively.  In addition, as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Bank had secured a discount window facility of $74.2 million and $73.2 million, respectively, at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, collateralized by investment securities with a fair market value of $79.0 million and $77.9 million, respectively.  The Bank also has a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank for $17.0 million which matures on June 30, 2020.  As of June 30, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under the discount window facility or the federal funds facility with the correspondent bank.

Subsidiary Activities
 
Federal savings institutions generally may invest up to 3% of their assets in service corporations, provided that at least one-half of any amount in excess of 1% is used primarily for community, inner-city and community development projects.  The Bank’s investment in its service corporations did not exceed these limits at June 30, 2019 and 2018.
 
The Bank has three wholly owned subsidiaries: Provident Financial Corp (“PFC”), Profed Mortgage, Inc., and First Service Corporation.  PFC’s current activities include: (i) acting as trustee for the Bank’s real estate transactions and (ii) holding real estate for investment, if any.  Profed Mortgage, Inc., which formerly conducted the Bank’s mortgage banking activities, and First Service Corporation are currently inactive.  At June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Bank’s investment in its subsidiaries was $15,000 and $28,000, respectively.

REGULATION
 
The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations which are applicable to the Corporation and the Bank.  The description of these laws and regulations, as well as descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations.
 
Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress that may affect the Corporation’s and the Bank’s operations.  In addition, the regulations governing the Corporation and the Bank may be amended from time to time by the OCC, FDIC, Federal Reserve Board, the SEC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), as appropriate.  Any such legislation or regulatory changes could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the Corporation and the Bank and no prediction can be made as to whether any such changes may occur.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and is affecting the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies.  The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Bank’s former federal banking regulator, and responsibility for the supervision and regulation of federal savings associations such as the Bank was transferred to the OCC July 21, 2011.  The OCC is the agency that is primarily responsible for the regulation and supervision of national banks.  Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The CFPB assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements.  The Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB with respect to its compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations.
 
Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to delayed effective dates and/or rulemaking by the federal banking agencies.  Their impact on operations cannot yet be fully assessed.  However, it has been the general view that the Dodd-Frank Act will increase the regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense for the Corporation, the Bank and the financial services industry more generally.
 
2018 Regulatory Reform
 
In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Act”), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory changes for community banks such as the Bank, and their holding companies.
 
The Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and directs the federal banking agencies to simplify the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” of between 8 and 10 percent. Under proposed regulations not yet adopted in final form, the federal banking regulators established 9% as the ratio so that any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the “community bank leverage ratio” will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered to be “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules. The Act also expands the category of holding companies that may rely on the “Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement” by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying holding company may have from $1 billion to $3 billion.  A major effect of this change is to exclude such holding companies from the minimum capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.
 27

 
It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the Act will ultimately be applied to the Bank or what specific impact the Act and the yet-to-be-written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks.
 
General
 
The Bank, as a federally chartered savings institution, is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC, as its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, as its insurer of deposits.  The Bank's relationship with its depositors and borrowers is regulated by federal consumer protection laws, and the CFPB issues regulations under those laws, which must be complied with by the Bank.  The Bank is a member of the FHLB and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank must file reports with the OCC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions.  There are periodic examinations by the OCC to evaluate the Bank’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements.  Under certain circumstances, the FDIC may also examine the Bank.  This regulatory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which the Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors.  The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss allowances for regulatory purposes.  Any change in such policies, whether by the OCC, the FDIC or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation and the Bank and their operations.  The Corporation, as a savings and loan holding company, is required to file certain reports with, is subject to examination by, and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, its primary regulator.  The Corporation is also subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws.  For additional information, see “Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulations” below in this Form 10-K.
Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions
 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  The OCC has extensive authority over the operations of federally chartered savings institutions.  As part of this authority, the Bank is required to file periodic reports with the OCC and is subject to periodic examinations by the OCC. The OCC also has extensive enforcement authority over all federally chartered savings institutions, including the Bank.  This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease-and-desist orders and initiate injunctive actions.  In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.  Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with the OCC.  Except under certain circumstances, public disclosure of final enforcement actions by the OCC is required by law.
 
All savings institutions must pay assessments to the OCC, to fund the agency’s operations.  The general assessments, paid on a semi-annual basis, are determined based on the savings institution’s total assets, including consolidated subsidiaries.  The Bank’s OCC annual assessments for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $262,000 and $281,000, respectively.
 
Federal law provides that federally chartered savings institutions are subject to the national bank limit on loans to one borrower.  A federally chartered savings institution generally may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus.  An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by specified readily marketable collateral.  The Bank’s limits on loans to one borrower or group of related borrowers at June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $18.3 million and $18.6 million, respectively.  At June 30, 2019, the Bank’s largest lending relationship to a single borrower or group of borrowers was a commercial real estate loan totaling $5.8 million, which was performing according to its original payment terms.
 
The OCC and the other federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings, internal controls and audit systems, interest rate risk 
  28

 
exposure and compensation and other employee benefits.  Any institution that fails to comply with these standards must submit a compliance plan.
 
The OCC’s oversight of the Bank includes reviewing its compliance with the customer privacy requirements imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”) and the anti-money laundering provisions of the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and regulations thereunder. The GLBA privacy requirements place limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information with unaffiliated third parties. They also require each financial institution offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with its privacy policy and with the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of their personal information with unaffiliated third parties. The USA Patriot Act significantly expands the responsibilities of financial institutions in preventing the use of the United States financial system to fund terrorist activities. Its anti-money laundering provisions require financial institutions operating in the United States to develop anti-money laundering compliance programs and due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. These compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations.
 
Federal Home Loan Bank System.  The Bank is a member of the FHLB – San Francisco, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs, each of which serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region.  The FHLB - San Francisco is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System.  It makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures, established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.  All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB - San Francisco.  In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing.  At June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Bank had $101.1 million and $126.2 million of outstanding advances, respectively, from the FHLB – San Francisco with a remaining available credit facility of $275.2 million and $275.1 million, respectively, based on 35% of total assets for both dates, which is limited to available collateral.  For additional information, see “Business – Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds – Borrowings” above in this Form 10-K.
 
As a member of the FHLB - San Francisco, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB – San Francisco.  At both June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Bank held $8.2 million of FHLB-San Francisco stock which was in compliance with this membership requirement.  During fiscal 2019 and 2018, there was no excess capital redemption.  In fiscal 2019 and 2018, the FHLB – San Francisco distributed $707,000 and $568,000 of cash dividends, respectively, to the Bank.  The cash dividends received in fiscal 2019 included a special cash dividend of $133,000.  There is no guarantee in the future that the FHLB – San Francisco will pay cash dividends or redeem excess capital stock held by its members.
 
Under federal law, the FHLB - San Francisco is required to contribute to low and moderately priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low and moderate income housing projects.  These contributions have in the past adversely affected the level of dividends paid by the FHLB - San Francisco and could continue to do so in the future.  These contributions also could have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB - San Francisco stock in the future.  A reduction in value of the Bank's FHLB - San Francisco stock may result in a corresponding reduction in the Bank’s capital.
 
Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC.  The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC.  Deposits are generally insured by FDIC up to $250,000 per account owner as defined by the FDIC, backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.  As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums in the form of assessments and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC insured institutions.  It may prohibit any FDIC insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the insurance fund.  The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions, after giving the OCC an opportunity to take such action, and may terminate the savings institution's deposit insurance if it 
 

29 
  
determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition.  Management of the Bank is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank's deposit insurance. 
 The FDIC imposes an assessment for deposit insurance on all depository institutions. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations, with institutions deemed less risky paying lower assessments.  Currently, assessment rates (inclusive of certain possible adjustments) range from 1.5 to 40 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital (subject to upward adjustment for certain debt). The FDIC may increase or decrease the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking. 
The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum reserve ratio (the ratio of the DIF to estimated insured deposits) from 1.15% to 1.35%. The FDIC must achieve the 1.35% reserve ratio by September 30, 2020 with insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more funding the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act gave the FDIC the authority to set a designated reserve ratio annually, which the FDIC currently has set at 2%, to be reached over time.
 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank.  No predictions can be made as to what assessment rates will be in the future. In addition to the assessment for deposit insurance, institutions are required to pay assessments relating to bonds issued in the late 1980s to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund. The FDIC discontinued FICO assessments upon maturity of those bonds in March 2019. For final four quarters for which FICO assessments were made, the average annualized rate for these assessments was 0.23 basis points. For the fiscal year 2019, the average annualized rate for the overall FDIC assessments was 3.47 basis points.
 
Qualified Thrift Lender Test.  Like all savings institutions (subject to a narrow exception not applicable to the Bank), the Bank is required to meet a qualified thrift lender (“QTL”) test to avoid certain restrictions on their operations.  This test requires a savings institution to have at least 65% of its total assets as defined by regulation, in qualified thrift investments on a monthly average for nine out of every 12 months on a rolling basis.  As an alternative, a savings institution may maintain 60% of its assets in those assets specified in Section 7701(a)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“Code”), as amended.  Under either test, such assets primarily consist of residential housing related loans and investments.
 
A savings institution that fails to meet the QTL test is subject to certain operating restrictions and the Dodd-Frank Act also specifies that failing the test is a violation of law that could result in an enforcement action and dividend limitations.  As of June 30, 2019, the Bank maintained 87.7% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and, therefore, met the qualified thrift lender test.  During fiscal 2019 and 2018, the Bank was in compliance with the QTL test as of each month end.
 
Capital Requirements. Regulatory capital requirements apply to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $3.0 billion or more and top-tier savings and loan holding companies.
 
The Bank is subject to the capital requirements adopted by the OCC. Since the holding company has less than $3.0 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis, and the Federal Reserve Board expects the holding company’s subsidiary bank to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. These requirements include minimum risk-based ratios for Tier 1 capital, common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, a total capital ratio based on risk-weighted assets and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio; and an additional capital conservation buffer over the required risk-based capital ratios. Under the capital regulations to meet the minimum capital ratios plus the capital conservation buffer applicable to the Bank, the Bank must have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% and exceed the following ratios: (i) a CETI capital ratio of 7.00%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.50%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.50%.
 
 30 
  
Mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are also deducted from capital.  In addition, Tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt, equity securities and interest-only strips.  Because of our asset size, we were given a one-time option to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt, equity securities and interest-only strips in our capital calculations. We elected to exercise this option to opt-out in order to reduce the impact of market volatility on our regulatory capital levels. 
 
As noted above, in addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratios, the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.  The capital conservation buffer requirement was fully phased-in on January 1, 2019.  Failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer will limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses.  If the Bank does not have the ability to pay dividends to the Corporation, the Corporation may be limited in its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders.
 
Under the current standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank must have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% and a total capital ratio of 10% and must not be subject to an order from the OCC mandating a specific capital ratio for the Bank.  As of June 30, 2019, the most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.  See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  An institution that is not well-capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits and the rates it can pay on deposits.
 
Prompt Corrective Action.  The OCC is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institution's degree of undercapitalization.  Subject to a narrow exception, the OCC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings institution that is "critically undercapitalized." OCC regulations also require that a capital restoration plan be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a savings institution receives notice that it is "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" or "critically undercapitalized." In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. “Significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to more extensive mandatory regulatory actions.  The OCC also may take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.
Limitations on Capital Distributions.  OCC regulations impose various restrictions on savings institutions and on their ability to make distributions of capital, which include dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account.  Generally, savings institutions, such as the Bank, that before and after the proposed distribution are well-capitalized, may make capital distributions during any calendar year up to 100% of net income for the year-to-date plus retained net income for the two preceding years.  However, an institution deemed to be in need of more than normal supervision or in troubled condition by the OCC may have its dividend authority restricted by the OCC.  If the Bank, however, proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet its capital requirements (or will not following the proposed capital distribution) or that will exceed these net income-based limitations, it must obtain the OCC's approval prior to making such distribution.  In addition, the Bank must file a prior written notice of a dividend with the Federal Reserve Board.   The Federal Reserve Board or the OCC may object to a capital distribution based on safety and soundness concerns.  Further restrictions on Bank dividends may apply if the Bank fails the QTL test.  In addition, as noted above, if the Bank does not have the required capital conservation buffer, its ability to pay dividends to the Corporation will be limited, which may limit the ability of the Corporation to pay dividends to its stockholders.
Activities of Savings Associations and Their Subsidiaries.  When a savings institution establishes or acquires a subsidiary or elects to conduct any new activity through a subsidiary that the association controls, the savings institution must seek approval 
 
 31
  
or notify the FDIC and the OCC 30 days in advance and provide the required information. Savings institutions also must conduct the activities of subsidiaries in accordance with existing regulations and orders. 
 
The OCC may determine that the continuation by a savings institution of its ownership, control of, or its relationship to, the subsidiary constitutes a serious risk to the safety, soundness or stability of the savings institution or is inconsistent with sound banking practices or with the purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.  Based upon that determination, the FDIC or the OCC has the authority to order the savings institution to divest itself of control of the subsidiary.  The FDIC also may determine by regulation or order that any specific activity poses a serious threat to the DIF.  If so, it may require that no DIF member engage in that activity directly.
 
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. The Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with “affiliates” is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as implemented by the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation W.  The term “affiliates” for these purposes generally means any company that controls or is under common control with an institution. The Corporation and its non-savings institution subsidiaries are affiliates of the Bank. In general, transactions with affiliates must be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.  In addition, certain types of transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the institution’s capital.  Collateral in specified amounts must be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from an institution. Savings institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary. In addition, these institutions are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or the providing of any property or service.
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) generally prohibits the Corporation from making loans to its executive officers and directors.  However, that act contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors, if the lending is in compliance with federal banking laws.  Under such laws, the Bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders (“insiders”), as well as entities which such persons control, is limited.  The law restricts both the individual and aggregate amount of loans the Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on the Bank’s capital position and requires certain Board approval procedures to be followed. Such loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment.  There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees.  There are additional restrictions applicable to loans to executive officers.
 
Community Reinvestment Act and Consumer Protection Laws.  Under the Community Reinvestment Act, every FDIC-insured institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound banking practices to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods.  The Community Reinvestment Act does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the Community Reinvestment Act.  The Community Reinvestment Act requires the OCC, in connection with the examination of the Bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications, such as a merger or the establishment of a branch, by the Bank.  The OCC may use an unsatisfactory rating as the basis for the denial of an application.  Due to heightened attention to the Community Reinvestment Act in the past few years, the Bank may be required to devote additional funds for investment and lending in its local community.  The Bank received a rating of satisfactory when it was last examined for Community Reinvestment Act compliance.
 
In connection with its deposit-taking, lending and other activities, the Bank is subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect consumers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population.  The CFPB issues regulations and standards under these federal consumer protection laws, which include, among others, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.  Through its 
 
 32
  
rulemaking authority, the CFPB has promulgated many final regulations under these laws that affect our consumer businesses.  Among these regulatory initiatives, are final regulations setting “ability to repay” and “qualified mortgage” standards for residential mortgage loans and establishing new mortgage loan servicing and loan originator compensation standards.  The Bank devotes substantial compliance, legal and operational business resources to ensure compliance with these consumer protection standards.
 
Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Laws.  The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of 2001.  These laws and regulations require the Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers.  Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions.  In addition, provisions of the USA Patriot Act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution's anti-money laundering activities when reviewing mergers and acquisitions.
Regulatory and Criminal Enforcement Provisions.  The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federally chartered savings institutions and has the authority to bring action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution.  Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease-and-desist order to removal of officers or directors, receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance.  Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can be nearly $2.0 million per day per violation in especially egregious cases.  The FDIC has the authority to recommend to the OCC that an enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution.  If the OCC does not take action, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances.  Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations.
Environmental Issues Associated with Real Estate Lending.  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), a federal statute, generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present "owners and operators" of sites containing hazardous waste.  However, Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the term "owner and operator" excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site.  Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this “secured creditor exemption” has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan.
 
To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including the Bank, that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs, which costs often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property.
 
Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations.  The Bank is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers.  While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, these include the GLBA, USA Patriot Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfers Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing.  These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights.

 Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation
 
General.  As a savings and loan holding company, the Corporation is subject to the regulatory oversight of the Federal Reserve Board.  Accordingly, the Corporation is required to register and file reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve Board.  In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over the Corporation and its non-savings institution subsidiaries, which also permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to present a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution.  In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking regulators must require any company that controls an FDIC-insured depository institution to serve as a source of strength for the institution, with the ability to provide financial assistance if the institution suffers financial distress. These and other Federal Reserve Board policies and regulations may restrict the Corporation’s ability to pay dividends. 
Capital Requirements.  Regulatory capital requirements adopted by the federal banking regulators apply to the Bank only, as discussed above. These capital requirements include provisions that might impact the ability of the Corporation to pay dividends to its stockholders or repurchase its shares. For a description of the capital regulations, see “Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions - Capital Requirements” above.
Activities Restrictions.  The GLBA provides that no company may acquire control of a savings association after May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the financial activities permitted for financial holding companies under the law or for multiple savings and loan holding companies as described below.  The GLBA also specifies, subject to a grandfather provision, that existing savings and loan holding companies may only engage in such activities.  The Corporation qualifies for the grandfathering and is therefore not restricted in terms of its activities.  Upon any non-supervisory acquisition of another savings association as a separate subsidiary, the Corporation would become a multiple savings and loan holding company and would be limited to those activities permitted multiple savings and loan holding companies by Federal Reserve Board regulation.  Multiple savings and loan holding companies may engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies, and certain other activities including acting as a trustee under a deed of trust and real estate investments.
 
If the Bank fails the QTL test, the Corporation must, within one year of that failure, register as, and become subject to the restrictions applicable to bank holding companies.  For additional information, see “Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions – Qualified Thrift Lender Test” in this Form 10-K.
 
Mergers and Acquisitions.  The Corporation must obtain approval from the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company or acquiring such an institution or holding company by merger, consolidation or purchase of its assets.  In evaluating an application for the Corporation to acquire control of a savings institution, the Federal Reserve Board would consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the Corporation and the target institution, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the DIF, the convenience and the needs of the community and competitive factors.
 
The Federal Reserve Board may not approve any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions; (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies and (ii) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the states of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions.  The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
 
Acquisition of the Company.  Any company, except a bank holding company, that acquires control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company becomes a “savings and loan holding company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board and must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act before obtaining control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company.  A 
 
 34
  

bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act before obtaining control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company and remains subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act.  The term “company” includes corporations, partnerships, associations, and certain trusts and other entities.  “Control” of a savings association or savings and loan holding company is deemed to exist if a company has voting control, directly or indirectly of more than 25% of any class of the savings association’s voting stock or controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the savings association or savings and loan holding company, and may be presumed under other circumstances, including, but not limited to, holding 10% or more of a class of voting securities if the institution has a class of registered securities, as the Corporation has.  Control may be direct or indirect and may occur through acting in concert with one or more other persons.  In addition, a savings and loan holding company must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval prior to acquiring voting control of more than 5% of any class of voting stock of another savings association or another savings association holding company.  A similar provision limiting the acquisition by a bank holding company of 5% or more of a class of voting stock of any company is included in the Bank Holding Company Act. 
Accordingly, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board would be required:
  
• | before any savings and loan holding company or bank holding company could acquire 5% or more of the common stock of the Corporation; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | before any other company could acquire 25% or more of the common stock of the Corporation, and may be required for an acquisition of as little as 10% of such stock.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In addition, persons that are not companies are subject to the same or similar definitions of control with respect to savings and loan holding companies and savings associations and requirements for prior regulatory approval by the Federal Reserve Board in the case of control of a savings and loan holding company or by the OCC in the case of control of a savings association not obtained through control of a holding company of such savings association.
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted in 2002 in response to public concerns regarding corporate accountability in connection with certain accounting scandals.  The stated goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act were to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the SEC, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including the Corporation.
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act includes very specific additional disclosure requirements and corporate governance rules, requires the SEC and securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosures, corporate governance and related rules and mandates.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees.  The Dodd-Frank Act imposes additional disclosure and corporate government requirements and represents further federal involvement in matters historically addressed by state corporate law.
 
Dividends and Stock Repurchases.  Savings and loan holding companies are subject to Federal Reserve policies which call for companies to operate with capital levels well above minimum ratios and notifying the Federal Reserve Board in advance for consultation with respect to a dividend that exceeds earnings for the relevant period, a material increase in stock dividends, and dividends or repurchases in circumstances that could raise supervisory concerns.  Examples of such circumstances include without limitation a dividend that could adversely change the company’s capital structure; a dividend when the company does not meet or is at risk of not meeting its capital requirements; a repurchase of stock that would reduce the amount of stock outstanding at the end of a quarter as compared to the beginning of the quarter and other repurchases that could materially affect the level or composition of the company’s capital base.
 
As discussed above, the capital conservation buffer requirements can limit the ability of a savings and loan holding company to pay dividends.
 
 35
  

  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010:  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law.  The Dodd-Frank-Act imposes various restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions and implements capital regulations discussed above under “2018 Regulatory Reform" and "Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions - Capital Requirements." For certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, the implementing regulations have not been promulgated, or amendments to current regulations are required under the Act or have otherwise been proposed, so the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on public companies cannot be determined at this time.


TAXATION
 
Federal Taxation
 
General.  The Corporation and the Bank report their income on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly the Bank’s reserve for bad debts discussed below.  The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Bank or the Corporation. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits, and deductions for individuals and businesses. For businesses, the Tax Act reduces the corporate federal income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21%. The corporate federal income tax rate reduction was effective January 1, 2018. Since the Corporation has a fiscal year end of June 30th, the reduced federal corporate income tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was the result of the application of a blended federal statutory tax rate of 28.06%, which was based on the applicable tax rates before and after the Tax Act and corresponding number of days in the fiscal year before and after enactment, and for fiscal 2019 and thereafter, it is a flat 21% corporate income tax rate.
 
Other major changes include expensing of equipment investment; elimination of personal and dependent exemptions, the tax on people who do not obtain adequate health insurance coverage, and the corporate alternative minimum tax; and increases in the standard deduction, the estate tax exemption, and the individual alternative minimum tax exemption.
 
Tax Bad Debt Reserves.  As a result of legislation enacted in 1996, the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves was repealed for tax years beginning after December 31, 1995.  Due to such repeal, the Bank is no longer able to calculate its deduction for bad debts using the percentage-of-taxable-income or the experience method.  Instead, the Bank is permitted to deduct as bad debt expense its specific charge-offs during the taxable year.  In addition, the legislation required savings institutions to recapture into taxable income, over a six-year period, their post 1987 additions to their bad debt tax reserves.  As of the effective date of the legislation, the Bank had no post 1987 additions to its bad debt tax reserves.  As of June 30, 2019, the Bank’s total pre-1988 bad debt reserve for tax purposes was approximately $9.0 million.  Under current law, a savings institution will not be required to recapture its pre-1988 bad debt reserve unless the Bank makes a “non-dividend distribution” as defined below.  Currently, the Corporation uses the specific charge-off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes.
Distributions.  In the event that the Bank makes “non-dividend distributions” to the Corporation that are considered as made from the reserve for losses on qualifying real estate property loans, to the extent the reserve for such losses exceeds the amount that would have been allowed under the experience method or from the supplemental reserve for losses on loans (“Excess Distributions”), then an amount based on the amount distributed will be included in the Bank’s taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Bank’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation.  However, dividends paid out of the Bank’s current or accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, will not be considered to result in a distribution 
 
 36
  
from the Bank’s bad debt reserve.  Thus, any dividends to the Corporation that would reduce amounts appropriated to the Bank’s bad debt reserve and deducted for federal income tax purposes would create a tax liability for the Bank.  The amount of additional taxable income attributable to an Excess Distribution is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution.  Thus, if the Bank makes a “non-dividend distribution,” then approximately one and one-half times the amount distributed will be included in taxable income for federal income tax purposes.  For additional information, see "Regulation - Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions - Limitations on Capital Distributions” in this Form 10-K for limits on the payment of dividends by the Bank.  The Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its tax bad debt reserve.  During fiscal 2019, the Bank declared and paid $7.5 million of cash dividends to the Corporation while the Corporation declared and paid $4.2 million of cash dividends to shareholders. 
 
Tax Effect from Stock-Based Compensation.  During fiscal 2019, there were 3,000 shares of restricted common stock distributed to non-employee members of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and 86,500 shares of restricted common stock distributed to employees. Also, there were 2,896 shares of non-qualified stock options exercised and 34,749 shares of incentive stock options exercised as disqualifying dispositions.  As a result, there was a $93,000 federal tax benefit effect from stock-based compensation in fiscal 2019.
 
Other Matters. The Internal Revenue Service has audited the Bank’s income tax returns through 1996 and the California Franchise Tax Board has audited the Bank through 1990.  Also, the Internal Revenue Service completed a review of the Corporation’s income tax returns for fiscal 2006 and 2007; and the California Franchise Tax Board completed a review of the Corporation’s income tax returns for fiscal 2009 and 2010.  Fiscal years 2016 and thereafter remain subject to federal examination, while the California state tax returns for fiscal years 2015 and thereafter are subject to examination by state taxing authorities.
State Taxation
 
California.  The California franchise tax rate applicable to the Bank, equals the franchise tax rate applicable to corporations generally, plus an “in lieu” rate of 2%, which is approximately equal to personal property taxes and business license taxes paid by such corporations (but not generally paid by banks or financial corporations such as the Corporation).  At June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Corporation’s net state tax rate was 8.4% and 7.8%, respectively.  Bad debt deductions are available in computing California franchise taxes using the specific charge-off method.  The Bank and its California subsidiaries file California franchise tax returns on a combined basis.  The Corporation will be treated as a general corporation subject to the general corporate tax rate.  There was a $54,000 state tax benefit effect from stock-based compensation in fiscal 2019, as described above in the section entitled "Federal Taxation."
Delaware.  As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Corporation is exempted from Delaware corporate income tax, but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, the Corporation paid franchise taxes of $200,000 and $208,000, respectively.
