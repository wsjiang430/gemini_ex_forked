ITEM 1: BUSINESS
Introduction
 
We design and develop technologies for the purpose of improving key performance characteristics of combustion systems, including emission and operational performance, energy efficiency and overall cost-effectiveness. We believe that our patented Duplex™ technology is capable of enhancing the performance of combustion systems in a broad range of markets, including the energy (upstream oil production and down-stream refining), institutional commercial and industrial boiler, chemical, and petrochemical industries. Our Duplex technology, which is our primary technology, uses a porous ceramic matrix at a distance to a burner to significantly reduce flame length and achieve very low emissions without the need for external flue gas recirculation, selective catalytic reduction, or excess air systems. To date, our operations have been funded primarily through sales of our equity securities. We have earned nominal revenue since inception in 2008.
 
Duplex has been successfully installed in 11 commercial projects across four different combustion applications. In addition, we have two ongoing projects that, if successful, will increase our installed project base and number of distinct applications. Based on the results of our laboratory and field testing, as well as our initial commercialized installations in different applications, we believe that this proprietary technology is capable of improving emissions control performance and operational performance for many types of industrial and commercial combustion systems. As a result, we also believe that Duplex may reduce costs associated with the construction (including refurbishment and upgrade), operation and maintenance of these combustion systems as compared to combustion systems that use no or alternative technology to enhance combustion and control emissions.
 
Based on the results of our testing and initial 11 field installations, we believe that Duplex compares favorably with current industry-standard air pollution control technologies, such as selective catalytic reduction devices, low- and ultra-low NOx burners (which address nitrogen oxides or NOx), external flue gas recirculation systems and other similar technologies. Such systems are used in our current target market segments of petroleum refining and petrochemical process heaters, large-scale once through steam generators (OTSGs), enclosed flares, institutional commercial and industrial boilers and other similar equipment.
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in Washington on January 23, 2008. The address of our corporate headquarters is 12870 Interurban Avenue South, Seattle, Washington 98168 and our telephone number is (206) 673-4848. Our website can be accessed at www.clearsign.com. The information contained on or that may be obtained from our website is not a part of this report. We currently operate in the United States and through a wholly owned subsidiary in the People’s Republic of China.
Our Industry
 
The combustion and emissions control markets are significant, both in the wide array of industries in which the systems are used and in the amount of money spent in installing and upgrading systems. Combustion systems are used to provide heat for all manner of industrial processes, including boilers, furnaces, kilns and gas turbines. In order to maximize energy efficiency while keeping pace with regulatory guidelines for air pollution emissions, operators of combustion systems are continually installing, maintaining and upgrading a variety of costly process control, air pollution control and monitoring systems. Although we believe that there are many potential markets for our Duplex technology, to date we have limited the introduction of Duplex to petroleum refining process heaters, steam generation, and enclosed flares.

Our initial target markets center on the energy sector, including upstream crude oil production through the use of OTSGs and wellhead enclosed flares and downstream oil refineries through the use of process heaters and boilers. In recent years, the energy sector has been significantly affected by the volatile market price of crude oil and marginal economic growth. Crude oil prices stabilized during 2016 and 2017 and enjoyed appreciation with the general post-election upswing in certain commodities and improved economic outlook. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil in the last five years has ranged from approximately $108 per barrel to approximately $26 per barrel, with 2018 prices ranging from $44 to $77 per barrel and February 2019 prices approximating $55 per barrel. Regardless of the effect of crude oil price volatility, based upon our experience and feedback from current and prospective customers, we believe that the value of our Duplex technology to the energy sector continues to be validated because of the technology’s ability to cost-effectively lower emissions and drive certain operational efficiencies.
 
We believe operators in all of our domestic target markets are under pressure to meet current and proposed federal, state and local pollution emissions standards. The standards applicable to our target markets have been developed over the past 50 years with broad political input. Due to the localized effects of poor air quality, we expect these standards to continue to become more stringent regardless of political leadership. We believe this to be the case in the U.S. and worldwide in most major developed and developing countries. As an illustration, air pollution emission standards are most stringent in the states of California and Texas, historically politically leaning in opposite directions. As a result, these standards are a significant driver in our development and sales efforts. We believe that our Duplex technology can provide a unique, cost-effective pollution control solution for operators in comparison to all known competing products.
 
Emissions standards largely emanate from the Clean Air Act, which is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and regulates six common criteria air pollutants, including ground-level ozone. These regulations are enforced by state and local air quality districts as part of their compliance plans. As a precursor to ground-level ozone, NOx is a regulated pollutant by local air quality districts in order to achieve the EPA limits. The 8-hour ground-level ozone regulations have been reduced from 84 parts per billion (ppb) in 1997, to 75 ppb in 2008, and 70 ppb in 2015, with the requirement of realizing these levels approximately 25 years following the year of legislation. The areas of non-attainment related to this 1997 limit of 84 ppb are depicted below in the map on the left and the projected areas of non-attainment related to the 2015 limit of 70 ppb are depicted below in the map on the right.

We have noted that local air quality districts in EPA designated “severe non-attainment zones” in California are uncertain as to how they will achieve the 2015 standard and other future EPA requirements. Because of this uncertainty, we believe that local regulators are in search of additional means beyond those included in the current regulations to comply with the impending standards. Although NOx emissions from refineries and other oil production and processing operations are highly regulated since they are historically a significant source of stationary NOx emissions, enclosed flares have not historically been viewed as a source requiring the same level of regulation. We believe that our Duplex technology is uniquely able to address the emissions challenges being faced by oil producers and other industries as those challenges relate to both current and reasonably predictable future local air emission standards.
 
Additionally, we believe that current emissions standards in Europe, the Middle East, other parts of Asia and Canada will continue to trend towards stricter air emission standards as these jurisdictions seek to achieve cleaner air. Existing and new emissions standards in such jurisdictions may create additional market opportunities for us.
 
Our Technologies
 
In the process of attempting to develop our initial Electrodynamic Combustion Control™ (ECC) technology beyond laboratory scale for a potential process heater design in 2013, we developed Duplex, which has broad applications for gaseous fuels. While we continue to pursue development of our ECC technology through laboratory testing, in 2014 we began to pursue field evaluation and sales of our Duplex technology. We have since completed a number of field evaluation projects in which we successfully demonstrated the technology operating with thermal output of up to 62 million BTU/hr in an OTSG and pursued business development and marketing activities with established entities that use steam generators, process heaters, enclosed flares, boilers, and other combustion systems, as well as with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).
 
We have completed 11 field projects in three of our five target markets using our Duplex technology: six related to wellhead enclosed flares, two related to process heaters in the oil refining industry, and three related to OTSGs in the enhanced oil recovery industry. We believe that the successful completion of these field evaluation projects, which resulted from years of research and development work, is fundamental to the commercialization of our Duplex product. We reported our first meaningful product sales of $621,000 during the second half of 2016 from the installation of our Duplex technology through retrofits of a wellhead enclosed flare for a major California oil producer, an enhanced oil recovery OTSG, and two refinery process heater projects. Furthermore, we entered into an agreement to supply the oil producer customer with five additional wellhead enclosed flare retrofits for $900,000 and in 2017 we delivered three units generating sales revenue of $540,000. The remaining two units were completed and installed in the first quarter of 2018, generating sales revenue of $360,000. An additional OTSG unit was also completed and invoiced during 2018. Our laboratory research currently focuses on enhancing our Duplex products and includes the development of an institutional commercial and industrial boiler application that enhances operational performance by eliminating flue gas recirculation.
 
Product Applications of Duplex
 
To date, we have deployed our Duplex technology through retrofits and replacements of existing burners. Retrofits often involve engineering around an existing burner architecture that can complicate the Duplex installation, whereas replacements are more straightforward, especially after the introduction of our Duplex Plug & Play® technology in February 2017. Because of this, we believe that the retrofit and replacement markets are ideally suited for larger projects and larger applications of Duplex.

Process Heaters in the Oil Refining Industry
 
To date, we have successfully retrofitted two process heaters with the standard Duplex and one demonstration unit with the Duplex Plug & Play design. The Duplex Plug & Play design provides a more simplified, pre-engineered and standardized direct burner replacement for traditional refinery process heaters. We believe that this product will reduce the customized engineering associated with typical retrofits and lend itself to mass production. The product derives its name from the fact that it is designed to allow quick and easy installation into a multi-burner heater or furnace and possibly allow the heater to continue operating during installation rather than be shut down. The ability to install the Duplex Plug & Play while the remaining burner system is operational will allow customers to limit down time and shorten the sales cycle often prolonged by annual or semi-annual scheduled maintenance. We plan to continue field testing larger size Duplex Plug & Play devices, as well as alternate multi-burner configurations to further enhance the performance and dependability of the product. If successful, we believe that this product, our first complete burner product, will be suitable for licensing and potential manufacturing arrangements with OEMs having established manufacturing and distribution capabilities.
Wellhead Enclosed Flares
 
A major California oil producer approached us in early 2016 to address a unique emission compliance need relating to wellhead enclosed flares. This was an important milestone because it demonstrated the broad application of our Duplex technology. A total of six units have been completed for enclosed flares to date.
 
Based upon discussions with local regulators and examination of regulatory reports, we believe that enclosed flare emissions are a potential target for increased regulation, in part because the success of our installations to date has shown regulators and the EPA that establishing NOx emissions standards for enclosed flares is possible. In anticipation of this, we are pursuing potential customers with target enclosed flare applications that would benefit from our technology.
 
OTSGs for Enhanced Oil Recovery Industry
 
We have successfully installed our Duplex technology in three OTSG projects in the enhanced oil recovery industry in California. We believe that these successful installations are gaining regulator acceptance by the Southern California regulatory authorities and, as a result, market acceptance.
Industrial Commercial Boilers
 
There are a large number of boiler manufacturers producing many styles of boiler equipment for many different applications. Boilers are used in many industrial applications, as well as in commercial and residential applications at much smaller scales. We are currently actively working on commercial boiler applications for two distinct types of industry standard commercial boilers – fire tube and water tube boilers. For fire tube products, we have recently developed our own prototype burner replacement product similar in concept to our Duplex Plug and Play device for process heaters. This product has achieved excellent results after testing in a typical commercial fire tube boiler produced by one of the industry’s largest suppliers. Water tube boilers are larger and more varied in their designs, so our approach has been to retrofit existing equipment with our Duplex technology rather than to design a replacement burner product. These field projects are ongoing. We anticipate significant progress during 2019 in testing this equipment. If the testing is successful, our goal will be to partner with established OEMs in the water tube and fire tube boiler industry for wider deployment of our Duplex technology.

Duplex’s Emission Results and Licensing
 
We have now achieved emission results in multiple applications that exceeded current local Best Available Control Technology (BACT) levels in multiple installations in California related to three of our five target industries. We intend to continue to demonstrate Duplex capabilities through (i) working with local air quality officials to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technology, (ii) operating in-place units, (iii) engineering and testing with new customers and applications, (iv) pursuing additional lab research and development of new applications (e.g. institutional commercial and industrial boilers) and next generation improvements to Duplex design and standardization, including the pursuit of more complete systems similar to the Duplex Plug & Play for application in other vertical markets, and (v) assisting our customers in making emission results available for designation as BACT by local regulatory bodies.
 
Our business plan contemplates licensing our technology after we prove commercial viability and generate interest from end users and OEMs. We believe licensing would significantly change the makeup of our sales mix, sales cycles, and margins. Licensing our technology within one or an array of selected vertical markets (e.g. burners for refinery process heaters or institutional commercial and industrial boilers) could dramatically accelerate the global sales and market adoption rate of our technology. However, in order to create channel flexibility and meet end user demand, we intend to continue to pursue end user customers through direct sales, sub-contractors, or channel partners. While we are currently pursuing various licensing arrangements, we have no agreements at this time and do not anticipate entering into any such agreements prior to completing the field evaluation projects discussed above and completing a sufficient number of installations and direct sales. We believe that the continuing development of Duplex, additional sales and an increase in the number of end user installations will enhance our ability to license our technology.
 
Development of ECC
 
We are continuing to pursue opportunities for our patented ECC technology through laboratory research where we have demonstrated certain favorable attributes of this proprietary technology operating at lab scales. We are also developing certain derivative product expressions that are being tested and validated both by the Company and by independent third parties
 
Technical Components of our Duplex and ECC Technologies
 
Our Duplex burner technology consists of an industrial burner and a porous ceramic matrix. When the unreacted mix of gaseous fuel and air is directed at the ceramic matrix, the mixture ignites and burns within the matrix itself. Because the fuel and air have more time to mix, the homogeneous mixture mitigates NOx- forming hot spots that are typically produced. The mixing and combustion in the ceramic matrix results in a dramatically shorter flame. NOx, a regulated pollutant comprised largely of nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide, is greatly reduced to levels of 5ppm or below, depending on the specific application, without any external fans or associated power, thereby minimizing harmful emissions while improving system efficiency. A shorter flame allows for operation of the furnace at a higher capacity. We believe Duplex’s radiant heat transfer from the ceramic matrix enhances thermal efficiency, and it eliminates the possibility of flame impingement and reduces the likelihood of carbon deposits forming on the inside surfaces of the process tubes (coking) or failure of process tubes.
 
Our ECC technology introduces a high voltage electric field into the combustion process to control the resulting flames electrically through the naturally forming ions. The electrodes are optimized in shape and location to best suit the specific geometry of a given installation.
 
The basic components of both systems are either available “off the shelf” or require manufacturing techniques that are well within the current capabilities of existing suppliers. Thus, our products can be readily available and scalable for high volume demand.

The Combustion Markets
 
Overview
 
We compete in the combustion and emissions control markets. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, in 2011, two-thirds of the energy used in U.S manufacturing is converted via boilers, furnaces, and process heaters, our core market focus.  Based on a June 2016 Frost & Sullivan Market Assessment Report, we estimate that our addressable target market over the next ten years in the United States is up to $3.6 billion, comprised of up to $1.7 billion from the institutional commercial and industrial boiler segment, up to $0.8 billion from the refinery segment, up to $0.8 billion from the large industrial segment, up to $0.2 billion from the flare segment, and up to $100 million from the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) segment.
 
These are highly competitive industries that are currently dominated by companies that have both substantially greater financial resources than we do and established products. Based on the testing and the field installations completed to date, however, we believe that our Duplex technology offers a unique and powerful ability to improve emissions and operational performance, energy efficiency and overall cost-effectiveness. We are targeting the following segments of the combustion market:
 

· | institutional commercial and industrial boiler segment
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | refinery and petrochemical segment
--+-----------------------------------


· | large industrial segment
--+-------------------------


· | enclosed flare segment
--+-----------------------


· | EOR segment
--+------------

 
In each segment, we are marketing solutions with our Duplex technology that we believe could simultaneously improve both pollution control and operational efficiency characteristics through (a) cost-effective retrofitting of our Duplex technology into existing standard system designs, and (b) new system designs.
 
Market Entry
 
We believe that our Duplex technology can be applied to a wide range of systems in which there is a flame. While this implies many potential market opportunities, it also requires that we exercise a disciplined approach in comparatively evaluating those opportunities in order to select and prioritize those applications that are cost effective and afford the best mix of time and cost required for development relative to revenue potential. We also aim to select applications in which our technologies either offer immediate, clear, meaningful, and measurable advantages relative to competing technologies or address unmet market needs. 
 
We have pursued retrofitting existing systems with our Duplex technology to improve their performance as we believe that provides us the quickest path to market. This is because (1) the installed base of existing combustion systems is far greater than the annual number of newly built systems, (2) integrating our technology into a retrofit is less complex than integrating our technology into a new combustion system designed by an OEM, (3) the design cycle of a retrofit application is far shorter, and (4) we believe that with the previously challenging economic and energy industry market conditions, less costly retrofits are more attractive to many segments of the energy market than new capital equipment and infrastructure builds to comply with environmental regulations and derive cost efficiencies.
 
Since we have completed initial retrofit projects in three vertical market installations, we believe that pursuit of new, stand-alone replacement products, such as the Duplex Plug & Play, will enable us to substantially increase our sales through licensing or other business arrangements with OEMs. Assuming that broader adoption of the Duplex Plug & Play occurs, our plan is to pursue OEMs or other means to license the product in order to take advantage of the manufacturing and distribution capabilities of more established market participants. We successfully completed and demonstrated in our lab a stand-alone low emissions packaged boiler and are currently pursuing opportunities to install the product in the field with suitable customers.

The operational success we have experienced with demonstration units in the wellhead enclosed flare, oil refining and enhanced oil recovery sectors has allowed us to capitalize on these recent product development results by refocusing our personnel and resources toward enhancing and productizing our Duplex technology in order to generate revenue. The success in these initial areas has also allowed us to work on developing our Duplex technology for installation in both fire tube and water tube boilers. A demonstration project on boilers is currently underway with a Chinese partner and research on this application continues in our laboratory.
 
Sales and Marketing Plan
 
Partnership Strategy and Field Development. We believe that our technologies have the potential to transform many industries that rely on combustion and that our technologies are broadly applicable in large, scalable, global markets.
 
We intend to form strategic partnerships and/or license agreements with key incumbents who are currently participating in our targeted market segments. We expect to maintain our existing capabilities to serve our end-user customers via our current channel partners and subcontractors.
 
Our targeted market segment territories include North America, Europe, and China and encompass:
 

· | end users of OEM products and services interested in incorporating our technology in order to address their operational and/or environmental needs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | large OEMs interested in our technology either as licensees or as distributors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | support from government regulators such as California’s South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and other regulators charged with protecting the public health, which support includes providing funds for the development of low emission and potentially disruptive environmental control technologies. Project funding from SCAQMD was recently awarded to ClearSign and a refinery partner to demonstrate Duplex as a candidate for Best Available Control Technology for certain types of process heaters.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We currently are pursuing field evaluation programs of our Duplex burner products. These programs are aimed at our target industrial combustion markets.
 
Pricing Strategy. Our target markets are characterized by well-established competitors in mature businesses. As a result, competitive pricing rather than pricing based on broad product value is the standard for these markets. Since we believe that our technology will provide greater economic value in comparison to our competitors, we plan to price our technology based upon the value that we believe it will provide in reduced air pollution control costs, including fines, and reduced maintenance and operating costs.
Channel Structure and Path to Market. Our path to market could involve any combination of (1) licensing our technologies for either one-time or periodic licensing fees for a period of time within specific fields of use and/or territories, (2) selling our intellectual property rights within specific fields of use and/or territories, or (3) manufacturing the components required to enable our technologies and/or supplying a complete burner package through strategic subcontracting agreements. Since our solutions consist largely of off-the-shelf components, we do not anticipate that we will require a large manufacturing capacity. To the extent we will require production of specific hardware, we plan to rely on outside contract manufacturers, which we believe are widely available and for which a competitive market exists.

Competition and Barriers to Entry
 
The industry in which we operate is global in scope and is populated by large, established suppliers of burners and post-combustion air pollution control systems, all of which possess substantially greater resources than we do. Worldwide, suppliers of burners and air pollution control equipment include but are not limited to companies such as UOP, Callidus, Eclipse and Maxon (all four are subsidiaries of Honeywell), John Zink Hamworthy Combustion (a subsidiary of Koch Industries and including Coen), General Electric, Haldor Topsøe, Hitachi, Linde, Zeeco and Fives Group, among others. 
 
These systems include low and ultra-low NOX burners, selective and non-selective catalytic reduction systems and other pollution control technologies. The companies that provide these systems are well established and their combustion and emissions control technologies are based on mature, well-understood technologies that are proven in the market. We believe the further development of their technologies, however, will be limited largely to marginal performance improvements. As a consequence of this relatively slow pace of adopting innovation, we believe current technology offerings from the large competitors have become largely commoditized, and differentiation between suppliers is very often based on price. This provides both an opportunity and a barrier to more nimble, disruptive companies.
 
From a customer's perspective, legacy air pollution control technologies are viewed as a cost of doing business, and as a means to operate within regulatory requirements and avoid fines. Unlike most other kinds of capital equipment that provide an economic return through enhanced productivity or efficiency, we believe customers of traditional emissions control equipment do not otherwise expect any positive return on these investments. We believe the Duplex suite of products offers customers the unique opportunity to realize a return on investment, thereby further differentiating the Company’s technologies from the competition.
 
As indicated above we are seeking to enter the combustion and emissions control market and to establish ourselves in a highly competitive industry against companies that have both substantially greater financial resources than we do and established products. Because they have been available in the market for many years, our competitors’ product offerings may have several advantages.  Among these are:

 

· | Availability of trained technicians: The number of technicians who are able to specify, install and operate our competitors’ products will be greater than those who have been trained on our technology.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Conservative choice: Because our competitors' technologies are well understood and their performance has been proven over time, customers may perceive their offerings as a safe, low-risk choice.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Business relationships: Because our competitors have established long-standing relationships with their customers, they may prefer to continue to do business with one another.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe, however, that our Duplex technology would be an attractive alternative to the products and solutions offered by companies with which we seek to compete. In particular, we believe that our Duplex technology could offer a unique cost-effective means to reduce many pollutants at the source while improving operational efficiency. We believe our Duplex technology could be capable of reducing the requirement for legacy equipment, offering customers the prospect of a positive return on their investment in the form of enhanced efficiency and productivity while reducing emissions to levels below or equivalent to existing air pollution control technologies. In particular, we believe our Duplex technology could offer the following advantages when compared with the next best alternatives. 
 
Emissions Reduction from Combustion Sources. Current technology reduces emissions by manipulating mixing of fuel and air, staging combustion in two or more zones, inefficient operation due to external recirculating flue gas or high excess air or post-combustion treatment of NOX using selective catalytic reduction. In contrast, we believe our Duplex technology can:
 

10
--


· | enhance mixing with none of the additional pressure drop or power requirements,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | eliminate external flue gas recirculation and/or high excess air, thereby improving thermal efficiency and reducing fuel consumption, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reduce NOx without impacting burner stability and safety, as some staged combustion does, or requiring expensive post-combustion treatments with chemical additives such as catalytic reduction requires.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Enhancing heat-transfer and process efficiency. The main goal of virtually all industrial combustion is to transfer heat to raise process fluid temperatures or enable a chemical reaction, and to do so as efficiently as possible. Conventional low NOx and ultra-low NOx combustion techniques involve long and sometimes unruly flames, which may lead to flame impingement on process tubes, decreases throughput, increases maintenance requirements and could pose a safety risk. We believe conventional combustion techniques have no additional practical means for enhancing heat transfer. In contrast, we believe that our technology’s ability to produce short, compact flames eliminates the potential for flame impingement and therefore allows improved throughput of the process heaters or boilers. In addition, we believe that our technology could enhance heat transfer to the process tubes as radiation properties from the solid Duplex matrix provide more effective radiation than a conventional flame. 
 
Compared to our competitors, we believe our technology could provide customers with a lower total cost of ownership by reducing capital and operating expenses and increasing in energy efficiency. 
 
Research and Development Program 
 
The experience and industry contacts of our management, board of directors, and consultants with potential customers in the petroleum, petrochemical, and industrial steam applications industries inform our research program. These are supported by field evaluation agreements, research agreements, and memoranda of understanding with potential development partners, customers and research institutions. Our research and development activities make use of employees and consultants that are experts in the areas of industrial combustion, statistical experimental design, gas turbines, fluid mechanics and heat transfer. 
 
We have tested our Duplex and ECC technologies in our laboratory at commercially relevant capacities. We have installed our Duplex technology on a retrofit and new build basis in numerous field evaluation sites, including our Duplex Plug & Play™ product. Our research and development activities include the following: (1) scale-up to commercial sizes for various product expressions suited to our five target markets. (2) collaborate with strategic end users for site demonstrations at full scale, (3) complete the first installation, (4) complete further installations to optimize the product, its installation, and its reliability, and (5) enhance our intellectual property portfolio. 

Intellectual Property Protection

We have generated inventions that we believe to be patentable subject matter and for which we have been seeking protection through patent application filings. As of December 31, 2018, we have 70 patent grants and another 92 patents pending. The earliest year in which any of our patents will expire is 2031. In terms of the technology breakdown of our patent portfolio, we have been granted 27 patents related to our Duplex technology and 43 patents related to our ECC technology. In terms of the geographic breakdown of our patent portfolio, 44 patent grants have been issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) with 59 patent applications pending. We have been issued 26 patents from foreign regulatory bodies related to our Duplex and ECC technologies, including 19 in China. We have 33 patent applications pending in various foreign jurisdictions. We maintain an active review process to monitor relevant new inventions to expand our intellectual property protection globally.

We cannot predict when our patent applications may result in issued patents, if at all. Further, we may modify a patent application in the future as we develop additional information. As a result, we may create additional patent applications from an existing application, consolidate existing patent applications, abandon applications, or otherwise modify applications based upon our judgment in order to protect our intellectual property in a reasonably cost beneficial manner.
 
Government Regulation

Government regulation, particularly environmental regulation is likely to play an important role in shaping our product mix and offerings. Field implementation of our technologies requires permits from various local, state and federal agencies that regulate mechanical and electrical infrastructure and fire and air pollution control. 
 
We believe that we offer major advances in emissions reductions and efficiency improvements. We also believe emissions regulations could enhance market demand for technology if such regulations require a reduction in pollutants such as NOX, CO and CO2. In such cases, possible legislation on greenhouse gases, boiler Maximum Available Control Technology (MACT) rules, or general reductions in required criteria pollutant levels could serve our business objectives. Although the timing of such regulations is uncertain, the general trend over the last decades continues to be government-mandated reduction for all criteria pollutants. Ultimately, it may be possible for our technology to achieve BACT designation. We believe the availability of our technology, by itself, may accelerate the government’s willingness to adopt more stringent environmental regulations. Further, we believe efficiency improvements, combined with the elimination of flame impingement, could generate market demand regardless of the existing regulatory framework because they could result in savings to businesses that adopt our technology.
 
Although the current U.S. administration has indicated that it plans to pursue the reduction of environmental regulations in order to promote economic activity and to eliminate or reduce perceived needless environmental regulations, the statements and actions to date have primarily referenced elimination of regulations associated with greenhouse gas emissions, an area with secondary benefit to our technologies, and the approval of oil pipelines, a step that may benefit our business and that of our customers in the energy sector. At this time, we are not aware of any current or proposed federal, state or local environmental compliance regulations that would have a material detrimental effect on our business objectives. We do not anticipate any major expenditures to be required in order for our technology to comply with any environmental protection statutes.
 
Employees
 
As of February 28, 2019, we had 16 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees. Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
