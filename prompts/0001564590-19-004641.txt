OUR COMPANY INFORMATION
 ICF International, Inc. began as a Delaware limited liability company formed in 1999 under the name ICF Consulting Group Holdings, LLC. It was formed to purchase our principal operating subsidiary, which was founded in 1969, from a larger services organization. A number of our current senior managers participated in this transaction, along with private equity investors. We converted to a Delaware corporation in 2003 and changed our name to ICF International, Inc. in 2006. We completed our initial public offering in September 2006. 
 Our principal executive office is located at 9300 Lee Highway, Fairfax, Virginia 22031, and our telephone number is (703) 934-3000. We maintain an internet website at www.icf.com. We make available our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to such reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and other information related to us, free of charge, on this site as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file those documents with, or otherwise furnish them to, the SEC. Our internet website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The SEC also maintains an internet website that contains reports, proxy, and information statements and other information, regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.
 MARKET OPPORTUNITY, SERVICES, AND SOLUTIONS
 Complex, long-term market factors, which include geopolitical, environmental and demographic trends, are changing the way people live and the way government and industry operate and interact. Some of these factors have significant impacts on the markets in which our clients operate. 
 In the energy, environment, and infrastructure market, these factors include: the changing mix of sources used to generate electricity and the related policy and infrastructure issues resulting from those changes; the changing position of the U.S. in the world’s energy markets overall; an ongoing focus on renewables, energy efficiency, climate change, and resilience; an aging transportation infrastructure; increasing drought and need to invest in water infrastructure and conservation; and environmental degradation.
 In the health, education, and social programs market, these factors include: the increasing level of healthcare expenditures and efforts at healthcare reform; global public health and health security issues, including potential global epidemics; aging populations across the globe; increasing military and veteran health demands; continued focus on disease prevention; the perceived declining performance of the U.S. educational system compared to other countries; and the desire to find more efficient means to deliver social and educational programs. 
 In the safety and security market, these factors include: the continuing spectrum of all-hazard threats, including cybersecurity threats, terrorism, severe weather and climatological changes, as well as infrastructure protection in both the physical realm and the cyber realms, and the intersection of those two. 
 In the consumer and financial market, these factors include increased use of interactive data technologies to link organizations with consumers and other stakeholders in more varied and personalized ways, and less reliance on traditional print and television marketing; changing industry structures in marketing and advertising services; the desire for greater return on marketing investment; and the continued elevation of data analytics as a business management and marketing tool, as well as the concomitant growth of concerns about, and regulation of, data capture and exploitation for marketing and other private and public sector purposes.
 In addition to these market-based factors, trends across all of our markets are increasing the demand for advisory services that drive our business. These trends include: increased government focus on efficiency and mission performance management; generational changes; the emphasis on transparency and accountability; and an increased demand for combining domain knowledge of client mission and programs with innovative technology-enabled solutions. We see growth opportunities for technology-based solutions involving digital services and strategic communications across all of our markets.
 We believe that demand for our services will continue as government, industry, and other stakeholders seek to understand and respond to these and other factors. We expect that our government clients will continue to utilize professional services firms with relevant domain expertise to assist with designing new programs, enhancing existing ones, offering transformational solutions, and deploying innovative information and communications technology. In addition, commercial organizations affected by these programs will need to understand such changes, 
 5

as well as their implications, in order for them to plan appropriately. More broadly, we believe our commercial clients will demand innovative services and solutions that can help them connect with customers and stakeholders in an increasingly connected and crowded marketplace. We also see opportunity to further leverage our digital and client engagement capabilities across our commercial and government client base.  We believe that our institutional knowledge and subject matter expertise are a distinct competitive advantage in providing our clients with practical, innovative solutions, which are directly applicable to their mission or business, and deploying them quickly with the right resources. Moreover, we believe we will be able to leverage the domain expertise and program knowledge we have developed through advisory assignments and our experience with program management, technology-based solutions, and engagement projects to win larger engagements, which generally lead to increasing returns on business development investment and promote higher employee utilization.  Rapid changes in technology, including the omnipresent influence of mobile, social, and cloud technologies, also demand new ways of communicating, evaluating and implementing programs, and we are focused on leveraging our expertise in technology to capitalize on those changes.
 Our future results will depend on the success of our strategy to capitalize on our competitive strengths, including our success in maintaining our long-standing client relationships, to seek larger engagements across the program life cycle and to complete and successfully integrate strategic acquisitions. We will continue to focus on building scale in vertical and horizontal domain expertise; developing business with both our government and commercial clients; and replicating our business model geographically in selected regions of the world. In doing so, we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that enhance our subject matter knowledge, broaden our service offerings, and/or provide scale in specific geographies.
 While we continue to see favorable long-term market opportunities, there are certain near-term challenges facing all government service providers. Administrative and legislative actions by the federal government to address changing priorities could have a negative impact on our business, which may result in a reduction to our revenue and profit and adversely affect cash flow. However, we believe we are well positioned to provide a broad range of services in support of initiatives that will continue to be priorities to the federal government as well as to state and local and international governments and commercial clients. 
 Our portfolio includes a sizable amount of federal client work and we take active measures to minimize the impact of any federal government shutdown on our performance and our people. While a significant portion of our federal business was not impacted by the recent U.S. government shutdown, we did receive stop-work orders for several of our federal contracts which were lifted once operations resumed in the affected government organizations. We do not anticipate a material impact on our operations as a result of the shutdown.  However, a federal government shutdown of any length is highly unpredictable for our impacted employees, for our clients, and for us as a company and, in the event of any future shutdowns, we cannot predict the impact on us or our operations.
 Energy, Environment, and Infrastructure
 For decades, we have advised on energy and environmental issues, including the impact of human activity on natural resources, and have helped develop solutions for infrastructure-related challenges. In addition to addressing government policy and regulation in these areas, our work focuses on industries that are affected by these policies and regulations, particularly those industries most heavily involved in the use and delivery of energy. Significant factors affecting suppliers, users, and regulators of energy are driving private and public sector demand for professional services firms, including:

• | Changing power markets, increasingly diverse sources of supply, and an increased demand for alternative sources of energy and/or energy storage;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ongoing efforts to upgrade energy infrastructure to meet new power, transmission, environmental, and cybersecurity requirements and to enable more distributed forms of generation; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The need to manage energy demand and increase efficient energy use in an era of environmental concerns, especially regarding carbon and other emissions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6

We assist energy enterprises worldwide in their efforts to analyze, develop, and implement strategies related to their business operations and the interrelationships of those operations with the environment and applicable government regulations. We utilize our policy expertise, deep industry knowledge, and proprietary modeling tools to advise government and commercial clients on key topics related to electric power, traditional fuels, and renewable sources of energy. Our areas of expertise include power market analysis and modeling, transmissions analysis, electric system reliability standards, energy asset valuation and due diligence, regulatory and litigation support, fuels market analysis, air regulatory strategy, and renewable energy and green power. 
 We also assist commercial and government clients in designing, implementing, and evaluating demand side management programs both for residential and for commercial and industrial sectors. Utility companies must balance the changing demand for energy with a price-sensitive, environmentally conscious consumer base. We help utilities meet these needs, guiding them through the entire life cycle of energy efficiency and related demand side management programs, including policy and planning, determining technical requirements, and program implementation and improvement.
 Carbon emissions have been an important focus of federal government regulation, international governments, many state and local governments, and multinational corporations around the world. Reducing or offsetting greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions continues to be the subject of both public and private sector interest, and the regulatory landscape in this area is still evolving. The need to address carbon and other harmful emissions has significantly changed the way the world’s governments and industries interact and continues to be one of the drivers of interest in energy efficiency. Moreover, how government and business adapt to the effects of climate change continues to be of global importance. We support governments at the federal and state and local level, including providing comprehensive support to NASA’s Global Change Research Program. Additionally, we support ministries and agencies of the government of the U.K. and European Commission, as well as commercial clients, on these and related issues. 
 We also have decades of experience in designing, evaluating, and implementing environmental policies and environmental compliance programs for transportation (including aviation) and other infrastructure projects. A number of key issues are driving increased demand for the services we provide in these areas, including:
  
• | Increased focus on the proper stewardship of natural resources;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Aging water, energy, and transportation infrastructure, particularly in the U.S.;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The increasing exposure of infrastructure to damage and interference by severe weather events influenced by a changing climate;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Under-investment historically in transportation infrastructure; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changing patterns of economic development that require transportation systems and energy infrastructure to adapt to new patterns of demand.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 By leveraging our interdisciplinary skills, which range from finance and economics to earth and life sciences, information technology, and program management, we are able to provide a wide range of services that include complex environmental impact assessments, environmental management information systems, air quality assessments, program evaluation, transportation and aviation planning and operational improvement, strategic communications, and regulatory reinvention. We help clients deal specifically with the interrelated environmental, business, and social implications of issues surrounding all transportation modes and infrastructure. From the environmental management of complex infrastructure engagements to strategic and operational concerns of airlines and airports, our solutions draw upon our expertise and institutional knowledge in transportation, urban and land use planning, industry management practices, financial analysis, environmental sciences, and economics.
 Health, Education, and Social Programs
 We also apply our expertise across our full suite of services in the areas of health, education, and social programs. We believe that a confluence of factors will drive an increased need for public and private focus on these areas, including, among others:

• | Expanded healthcare services to underserved segments of the population;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rising healthcare expenditures, which require the evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of current and new programs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7

 
• | Rampant substance abuse and widespread social and health impacts of the opioid abuse epidemic;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growing awareness of the threats from the global spread of disease;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The emphasis on improving the effectiveness of the U.S. and other countries’ educational systems;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The need for greater transparency and accountability of public sector programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A continued high need for social support systems;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | The need to recover from natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and earthquakes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A changing regulatory environment; and
--+---------------------------------------


• | Military personnel returning home from active duty with health and social service needs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe we are well positioned to provide our services to help our clients develop and manage effective programs in the areas of health, education, and social programs at the international, regional, national, and local levels. Our subject matter expertise includes public health, mental health, international health and development, health communications and associated interactive technologies, education, child and family welfare needs, housing and communities, and substance abuse. Our combination of domain knowledge and our experience in information technology-based applications provides us with strong capabilities in health and social programs informatics and analytics, which we believe will be of increasing importance as the need to manage information grows. We partner with our clients in the government and commercial sectors to increase their knowledge base, support program development, enhance program operations, evaluate program results, and improve program effectiveness.
 In the area of public health, we support many agencies and programs within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) (including the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”)) by conducting primary data collection and analyses, assisting in designing, delivering and evaluating programs, managing technical assistance centers, providing instructional systems, developing information technology applications, and managing information clearinghouse operations. Increasingly, we provide multichannel communications and messaging for public health programs using capabilities similar to our commercial marketing business. We also provide training and technical assistance for early care and educational programs (such as Head Start), and health and demographic surveys in developing countries for the U.S. Department of State (“DOS”). In the area of social programs, we provide extensive training, technical assistance, and program analysis and support services for a number of the housing and disaster recovery programs of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and state, territorial, and local governments. In addition, we provide research, program design, evaluation, and training for educational initiatives at the federal and state level. We provide similar services to a variety of U.K. ministries, as well as several Directorates-General of the European Commission.
 Safety and Security
 Safety and security programs continue to be a critical priority of the federal government, state and local governments, international governments (especially in Europe), and in the commercial sector. We believe we are positioned to meet the following key safety concerns:

• | Vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber and terrorist threats;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing risks to enterprises’ reputations in the wake of a cyber-attack;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broadened homeland security concerns that include areas such as health, food, energy, water, and transportation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reassessment of the emergency management functions of homeland security in the face of natural disasters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety issues around crime and at-risk behavior;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Increased dependence on private sector personnel and organizations in emergency response; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The need to ensure that critical functions and sectors are resilient and able to recover quickly after attacks or disasters.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8

These security concerns create demand for government programs that can identify, prevent, and mitigate key cybersecurity and the societal issues they cause.
 We believe that demand for our services will continue to grow as government, industry, and other stakeholders seek to address critical long-term societal and natural resource issues due to heightened concerns about: clean energy and energy efficiency; health promotion, treatment, and cost control; natural disaster relief and rebuild efforts; and ongoing homeland security threats. In the wake of the major hurricanes (Harvey, Irma, Maria and Michael) that devastated communities in Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, the affected areas remain in various stages of relief and recovery efforts.  We believe our prior experience with disaster relief and rebuild efforts, including those from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and Superstorm Sandy, puts us in a favorable position to provide recovery assistance, housing, and environmental and infrastructure solutions on behalf of federal departments and agencies, state, territorial and local jurisdictions, and regional agencies. 
 In addition, the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) is undergoing major transformations in its approach to strategies, processes, organizational structures, and business practices due to several complex, long-term factors, including:
  
• | The changing nature of global security threats, including cybersecurity threats;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Family issues associated with globally-deployed armed forces;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | The increasing use of commercial cloud computing infrastructure and services to support the DoD enterprise; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The increasing need for real-time information sharing and logistics modernization and network-centric planning requirements, and the global nature of conflict arenas.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We provide key services to DoD, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), and analogous Directorates-General at the European Commission. We support DoD by providing high-end strategic planning, analysis, and technology-based solutions in the areas of logistics management, operational support, command and control, and cybersecurity. We also provide the defense sector with critical infrastructure protection, environmental management, human capital assessment, military community research, and technology-enabled solutions. At DHS, we assist in shaping and managing critical programs to ensure the safety of communities, developing critical infrastructure protection plans and processes, establishing goals and capabilities for national preparedness at all levels of government in the U.S., and managing the national program to test radiological emergency preparedness at the state and local government levels in communities adjacent to nuclear power facilities. At DOJ, we provide technical and communications assistance to programs that help victims of crime and at-risk youths. At the European Commission, we provide support and analytical services related to justice and home affairs issues within the European context.
 Consumer and Financial Markets
 In the area of consumer and financial markets, we combine our expertise in strategic communications, marketing and creative services and public relations with our strengths in interactive and mobile technologies to help companies develop stronger relationships and engage with their customers and stakeholders across all channels, whether via traditional or digital media, to drive better operating results. We continue to strengthen our services in the fields of content and customer relationship management, loyalty marketing, and end-to-end e-commerce.   In an effort to enhance our positioning and build awareness outside of our traditional client set, we have combined capabilities from strategic acquisitions to create a full-service, technology-rooted advertising agency that guides brands digitally through informed strategy, inspired creative design, and technical know-how. We have the capability to complete projects big or small across all channels (including web, social, mobile, intranet and emerging platforms) through end-to-end technology-based implementations for local and global clients. Target customer areas include airlines, airports, electric and gas utilities, oil companies, banks and other financial services companies, transportation, travel and hospitality firms, non-profits/associations, law firms, manufacturing firms, retail chains, and distribution companies.

COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
 We possess the following key business strengths:
 We have a highly-educated professional staff with deep subject matter knowledge
 We possess strong intellectual capital that provides us with a deep understanding of policies, processes, and programs across our clients’ markets. Our thought leadership is based on years of training, experience, and education. We are able to apply our in-depth knowledge of our subject matter experts and our experience developed over 40 years of providing advisory services to address the problems and issues our clients are facing. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 34% of our benefits-eligible staff held post-graduate degrees in diverse fields such as the social sciences, business and management, physical sciences, public policy, human capital, information technology, mathematics, engineering, planning, economics, life sciences, and law. These qualifications, and the complementary nature of our markets, enable us to deploy multi-disciplinary teams to identify, develop, and implement solutions that are creative, pragmatic, and tailored to our clients’ specific needs.
 We believe our diverse range of client markets, services, and projects provide a stimulating work environment for our employees that enhances their professional development. The use of multi-disciplinary teams provides our staff the opportunity to develop and refine common skills required in many types of engagements. Our approach to managing people fosters collaboration and significant cross-utilization of the skills and experience of both industry experts and other personnel who can develop creative solutions by drawing on their different experiences. The types of services we provide, and the manner in which we do so, enable us to attract and retain talented professionals from a variety of backgrounds while maintaining a culture that fosters teamwork and excellence.
 We have strong, long-standing relationships with clients across a diverse set of markets
 The long-term relationships we maintain with many of our clients reflect our successful track record of fulfilling our clients’ needs. We have advised both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and HHS for more than 30 years, the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) for more than 25 years, DoD for more than 20 years, certain commercial clients in our energy markets for more than 20 years, the European Commission for more than 15 years, and we have multi-year relationships with many of our other clients in both our government and commercial client base. We have numerous contacts at various levels within our clients’ organizations, ranging from key decision-makers to functional managers. The long-standing nature and breadth of our client relationships adds greatly to our institutional knowledge, which, in turn, helps us carry out our client engagements more effectively and maintain and expand such relationships. Our extensive experience and client contacts, together with our prime-contractor position on a substantial majority of our contracts, and experience working alongside our clients, gives us clearer visibility into future opportunities and emerging requirements. We believe our balance between government civilian and defense agencies, our commercial presence, and the diversity of markets in which our clients operate help mitigate the impact of policy or political shifts, as well as annual shifts in our clients’ budgets and priorities.
 Our advisory services position us to capture a full range of engagements
 We believe our advisory approach, which is based on our subject matter expertise combined with an understanding of our clients’ requirements and objectives, is a significant competitive differentiator that helps us gain access to key client decision-makers during the initial phases of a policy, program, project, or initiative. We use our expertise and understanding to formulate customized recommendations for our clients. We believe this domain expertise and the program knowledge developed from our advisory engagements further position us to provide a full suite of services across the entire life cycle of a particular policy, program, project, or initiative. As a result, we are able to understand our clients’ requirements and objectives as they evolve over time. We then use this knowledge to provide continuous improvement across our entire range of services, which maintains the relevance of our recommendations. 
 Our technology-enabled solutions are driven by our subject matter expertise and creativity
 Government and commercial decision-makers have become increasingly aware that, to be effective, technology-based solutions need to be seamlessly integrated with people and processes. We possess strong knowledge in information technology and a thorough understanding of organizational behavior and human decision processes. This combination of skills, along with our domain knowledge, allows us to deliver technology-enabled solutions tailored to our clients’ business and organizational needs with less start-up time required to understand 
 10

client issues. In addition, many of our clients seek to deploy cutting-edge solutions to communicate and transact with citizens, stakeholders, and customers in a multichannel environment, and doing so takes both our constantly-refreshed technical know-how and world-class creativity.
 Our proprietary tools, analytics and methods allow us to deliver superior solutions to our clients
 We believe our innovative, and often proprietary, analytics and methods are key competitive differentiators because they enhance our ability to deliver customized solutions to our clients and enable us to deliver services in a more cost-effective manner than our competitors. For example, we have developed industry-standard energy and environmental models that are used by governments and commercial entities around the world for energy planning and air quality analyses and have also developed a suite of proprietary climate change tools to help the private sector develop strategies for complying with GHG emission reduction requirements. Our loyalty marketing services are often provided via our proprietary Tally software, software as a service. We maintain proprietary databases that we continually refine and that are available to be incorporated quickly into our analyses on client engagements. In addition, we also have proprietary program management methodologies and services that we believe can help clients improve performance measurement, support chief information officer and science and engineering program activities, and reduce security risks.
 We are led by an experienced management team
 Our management team, consisting of approximately 264 officers with the title of vice president or higher, possesses extensive industry experience and had an average tenure of 13.7 years with us as of December 31, 2018 (including prior service with companies we have acquired). This low turnover allows us to retain institutional knowledge. Our managers are experienced both in marketing efforts and in successfully managing and executing our key services. Our management team also has experience in acquiring other businesses and integrating those operations with our own. A number of our managers are industry-recognized thought leaders. We believe that our management’s successful past performance and deep understanding of our clients’ needs have been and will continue to be differentiating factors in competitive situations.
 We have a broad global presence
 We serve our clients with a global network of more than 65 regional offices throughout the U.S., and more than 15 offices in key markets outside the U.S., including offices in the U.K., Belgium, China, India and Canada. Our global presence also gives us access to many of the leading experts on a variety of issues from around the world, allowing us to expand our knowledge base and areas of functional expertise. Over the past year, we worked in dozens of countries, helping government and commercial clients with energy, environment, infrastructure, healthcare, marketing, interactive technology/e-commerce, and air transport matters.
 STRATEGY
 Our strategy to increase our revenue and shareholder value involves the following key elements:
 Expand our commercial businesses
 We plan to continue to pursue profitable commercial projects and we believe we have strong, global client relationships in both the commercial energy and air transport markets. We continue to see growth opportunities in our current commercial business in the utility sector, as well as significant potential for us to expand our business in other commercial areas, such as aviation and digital marketing services and strategic communications services, both domestically and internationally. 
 We view the energy industry as a particularly attractive sector for us over the next decade due to concerns over controlling energy costs and limiting climate and environmental impacts, increased state and federal regulation, the need for cleaner and more diverse sources of energy, and the concomitant need for infrastructure to transport, store, and/or convert those new energy sources. We also believe that the combination of our vertical domain expertise with our digital marketing expertise makes us a provider of choice for high value-added assignments in that arena. Although we believe the utility industry will continue to be a strong market for advisory services, particularly in light of the changing focus on regulatory actions and alternative energy sources, we intend to leverage our existing relationships and institutional expertise to pursue and capture additional, typically higher-margin opportunities. For example, we believe we can continue to expand our program and technology-based services in 
 11

areas such as assisting with the implementation of energy efficiency programs, information technology applications, and environmental management services for larger utilities. In addition, the growth of interest in sustainability and energy efficiency issues has created opportunities to offer these types of services to new clients beyond our traditional sectors. We believe these factors, coupled with our expansive national and global footprint, will result in a greater number of engagements that will also be larger in size and scope.
 We expect that interest in energy advisory services will continue to expand as clients in a number of industries, including information service providers and companies engaged in travel and tourism, seek to better understand their energy consumption options and the positive benefits of demonstrating environmental stewardship. Our broad range of services to the aviation industry makes us well positioned to capitalize on significant industry changes, including substantial airline equipment upgrades to newer, more efficient aircraft models in a cost-constrained environment; renovations of older airports to adapt to newer aircraft; and changes to airport business models and strategy as they place increasing importance on passenger experience.  
 Our engagement services, including marketing, interactive technology, and strategic communications offerings, are well-positioned to support the continuing growth of multichannel engagement and e-commerce. We have broadened our client offerings, particularly in the areas of content management, marketing and digital services. We can now offer complete end-to-end solutions for chief marketing officers, chief communications officers, and chief technology officers as they invest in digital marketing platforms and solutions. We deliver cutting-edge digital strategy support, as well as the creative services that help brands, products and services succeed in a crowded marketplace. As a means of more comprehensively communicating and delivering our engagement services to customers in both the private and public sectors, ICF recently announced the creation of ICF Next, an umbrella under which all of ICF’s engagement capabilities can be integrated, communicated, and delivered to clients.
 Replicate our business model across government and industry in selected geographies
 We believe the services we provide to our energy, environment, and infrastructure market have strong growth potential in selected geographies. Our domain expertise is well suited in Europe to meet the need for cutting-edge climate change, energy and environmental solutions, particularly with our offerings to the U.K. government and European Commission.  We have also focused our geographic footprint, when prudent, by selectively closing or reducing the size of offices which appear to be unlikely to generate profitable growth in the near to medium term, generally in nations or regions undergoing either economic or political challenges.
 Strengthen our technology-based offerings
 We continue to strengthen our services in the fields of content and customer relationship management, loyalty marketing, and end-to-end e-commerce. We are positioned to increase these services by expanding the technological underpinnings of our business, while bringing these marketing and e-commerce solutions, as well as expanded data management and analytics offerings, to our clients to better link them with consumers and other stakeholders.
 Leverage advisory work into full life cycle solutions
 We plan to continue to leverage our advisory services and strong client relationships to increase our revenue by winning longer term engagements. These engagements could include: information services and technology-based solutions, project and program management, business process solutions, marketing and communications delivery, strategic communications, and technical assistance and training. Our advisory services provide us with insight and understanding of our clients’ missions and goals. We believe the domain expertise and program knowledge we develop from these advisory assignments position us to capture a greater portion of the resulting larger engagements. However, we will need to undertake such expansion carefully to avoid actual, potential, and perceived conflicts of interest. 
 Defend, expand, and deepen our presence in core U.S. federal and state and local government markets
 Changing political priorities at the U.S. federal, state (including territories), and local government levels have created challenging market conditions for all competitors in the government services sector. We will focus not only on defending our current market footprint, but also on innovating to continue expanding across key growth markets, such as U.S. federal government health-related and cybersecurity initiatives, digital services, and disaster recovery work for state and local governments. We will continue to provide innovative solutions that help our public sector clients do more with less. We will specifically target deeper penetration of those agencies that currently procure 
 12

services only from one or two of our service areas. We believe we can leverage many of our long-term client relationships by introducing these existing clients, where appropriate, to our other services in order to better meet their needs. For example, we plan to introduce many of our advisory clients to our capabilities to provide associated information technology, cybersecurity, large-scale program management, and strategic communications and digital services. We can also offer clients our extensive performance measurement, program evaluation, and performance management services. Finally, having more than 65 offices across the U.S allows us to focus more of our business development efforts on addressing the needs of U.S. federal and state and local government agencies with operations outside of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.
 Pursue larger prime contract opportunities
 We believe that continuing to expand our client engagements into services we offer as part of our end-to-end client solutions enables us to pursue larger prime contract opportunities, which should provide a greater return on our business development efforts and allow for increased employee utilization. We plan to continue to target larger and longer-term opportunities through greater emphasis on early identification of opportunities, strategic capture and positioning, and enhanced brand recognition. We believe that the resulting increase in the scale, scope, and duration of our contracts will help us continue to grow our business.
 Pursue strategic acquisitions
 We plan to augment our organic growth with selective, strategic acquisitions when the target company will enable us to obtain new clients, increase our presence in attractive markets, and/or obtain capabilities that complement our existing portfolio of services, provided that the target company has a cultural compatibility and we expect that that the acquisition will have a positive financial impact.
 These elements of our strategy permeate all of the Company and influence day-to-day decisions. We believe that, collectively, they support the overall long-term growth of the organization.
 CLIENT AND CONTRACT MIX
 Government clients (including U.S. federal, state (including territories) and local, as well as international, governments) accounted for approximately 64%, 62%, and 65% of our 2018, 2017, and 2016 revenue, respectively.  Commercial clients (including U.S. and international clients) accounted for approximately 36%, 38%, and 35% of our 2018, 2017, and 2016 revenue, respectively. Our clients span a broad range of civilian and defense agencies and commercial enterprises. Commercial clients include non-profit organizations and universities, while government clients include the World Bank and the United Nations. In general, a client is considered to be a government client if its primary funding is from a government agency or institution. If we are a subcontractor, we classify the revenue based on the nature of the ultimate client receiving the services. 
 In the fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, our three largest clients were HHS, DOS, and DoD. The following table summarizes the percentage of our total revenue for each of these. 
 
 
 | Year ended December 31, | 
----------------------------------------+-------------------------+---
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
Department of Health and Human Services | | 17 | % | | 20 | % | 19 | %
Department of State | | 6 | % | | 6 | % | 6 | %
Department of Defense | | 5 | % | | 5 | % | 5 | %
Total | | 28 | % | | 31 | % | 30 | %

 
Most of our revenue is derived from prime contracts in which we work directly for the end customer, which accounted for approximately 92%, 91%, and 90% of our revenue for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
 Our contract periods typically extend from one month to five years, including option periods. Many of our government contracts provide for option periods that may be exercised by the client. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, no single contract accounted for more than 4% of our revenue. Our 10 largest contracts by revenue collectively accounted for approximately 18%, 15%, and 14% of our revenue in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
 13

International revenues increased by $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, as a result of both organic growth and growth through acquisitions, due to increases in our international government client services in the energy, environment and infrastructure and in the health, education, and social program client markets and increases in our international commercial client services in the consumer and financial client markets.
 CONTRACT BACKLOG
 We define total backlog as the future revenue we expect to receive from our contracts and other engagements. We generally include in our total backlog the estimated revenue represented by contract options that have been priced, but not exercised. We do not include any estimate of revenue relating to potential future delivery orders that might be awarded under our U.S. General Services Administration Multiple Award Schedule (“GSA Schedule”) contracts, other Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (“IDIQ”) contracts, Master Service Agreements (“MSAs”), or other contract vehicles that are also held by a large number of firms and under which potential future delivery orders or task orders might be issued by any of a large number of different agencies, and are likely to be subject to a competitive bidding process. We do, however, include potential future work expected to be awarded under IDIQ contracts that are available to be utilized by a limited number of potential clients and are held either by us alone or by a limited number of firms.
 We include expected revenue in funded backlog when we have been authorized by the client to proceed under a contract up to the dollar amount specified by our client, and this amount will be owed to us under the contract after we provide the services pursuant to the authorization. If we do not provide services authorized by a client prior to the expiration of the authorization, we remove amounts corresponding to the expired authorization from funded backlog. We do include expected revenue under an engagement in funded backlog when we do not have a signed contract, but only in situations when we have received client authorization to begin or continue working and we expect to sign a contract for the engagement. In this case, the amount of funded backlog is limited to the amount authorized. Our funded backlog does not represent the full revenue potential of our contracts because many government clients, and sometimes other clients, authorize work under a particular contract on a yearly or more frequent basis, even though the contract may extend over several years. Most of the services we provide to commercial clients are provided under contracts or task orders under MSAs with relatively short durations. As a consequence, our backlog attributable to these clients is typically reflected in funded backlog and not in unfunded backlog.
 We define unfunded backlog as the difference between total backlog and funded backlog. Our estimate of unfunded backlog for a particular contract is based, to a large extent, on the amount of revenue we have recently recognized on the particular contract under the assumption that future utilization will be similar, our past experience in utilizing contract capacity on similar types of contracts, and our professional judgment. Accordingly, if contract utilization is different from our expectations, the revenue eventually earned on a contract may be lower or higher than that implied by our estimate, at a point in time or during the life of a contract, of total backlog, including unfunded backlog. Although we expect our total backlog to result in revenue, the timing of revenue associated with both funded and unfunded backlog will vary based on a number of factors, and we may not recognize revenue associated with a particular component of backlog when anticipated, or at all. Our government clients generally have the right to cancel any contract, or ongoing or planned work under any contract, at any time. In addition, there can be no assurance that revenue from funded or unfunded backlog will have similar profitability to previous work or will be profitable at all. Generally speaking, we believe the risk that a particular component of backlog will not result in future revenue is higher for unfunded backlog than for funded backlog. 
 Our funded and estimates of unfunded and total backlog were as follows at December 31: 
 
 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | | 2016
--------------+---------------+---------+------+---+---------+-----
 | (in millions) | 
Funded | $ | 1,140.1 | | $ | 1,060.0 | | $ | 1,020.3
Unfunded | | 1,237.6 | | | 890.4 | | | 1,102.4
Total backlog | $ | 2,377.7 | | $ | 1,950.4 | | $ | 2,122.7

 
There were no awards included in our 2018, 2017 or 2016 backlog amounts that were under protest.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
 Our business development efforts are critical to our organic growth. Our business development processes and systems are designed to enable agility and speed-to-market over the business development life cycle, especially given the distinctions between commercial and government clients. Business development efforts in priority market areas, which include some of our largest federal agency accounts (HHS, DOS, DOE, U.S. Department of Transportation and EPA), are executed through account teams, each of which is headed by a corporate account executive and supported by dedicated corporate business development professionals and senior staff from the relevant operational area. Each account executive has significant authority and accountability to set priorities, focusing on larger and strategically important pursuits, and utilize appropriate resources to win new work. Each team participates in regular executive reviews of marketing plans and proposal development process. Our non-federal government clients are served by account leaders from operating units and coordinated by senior executives with industry experience where such coordination is deemed appropriate to enhance our business development success. This account-based approach allows deep insight into the needs of current and future clients. It also helps us anticipate our clients’ evolving requirements over the coming 12 to 18 months and position ourselves to meet those requirements. Each administrative group is responsible for maximizing sales in our existing accounts and finding opportunities in closely-related accounts. 
 The corporate business development function also includes a market research and competitive intelligence group, a proposal group, a marketing group, a communications group, and a strategic capture unit. The marketing group engages in brand marketing and strategic marketing program development and execution to raise awareness of our services and solutions across our markets, and to generate leads for further pursuit by sales personnel. Our contracts and administration function supports bid price development in partnership with the business development account teams.
 COMPETITION
 We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented marketplace and compete against a number of firms in each of our clients’ key markets. Some of our principal competitors include: Abt Associates Inc.; AECOM Technology Corporation; Alliance Data Systems Corporation; Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation; CACI International Inc.; Cambridge Systematics, Inc.; CRA International, Inc.; Deloitte LLP; Eastern Research Group, Inc.; Cardno ENTRIX, Inc.; L-3 Technologies, Inc.; Leidos Holdings, Inc.; Lockheed Martin Corporation; ManTech International Corporation; Navigant Consulting, Inc.; Northrop Grumman Corporation; Omnicom Group Inc.; PA Consulting Group; PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC); Publicis Group; Science Applications International Corp; Research Triangle Institute; Tetra Tech Inc.; Westat, Inc., and WPP Plc. In addition, we have numerous smaller competitors, many of which have narrower service offerings and serve niche markets. Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have greater access to resources and stronger brand recognition than we do.
 We consider our principal competitive discriminators to be long-standing client relationships, good reputation and past performance of the firm, client references, technical knowledge and industry expertise of employees, quality of services and solutions, scope and scale of our service offerings, and pricing.
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 We own a number of trademarks and copyrights that help maintain our business and competitive position. Sales and licenses of our intellectual property do not currently comprise a substantial portion of our revenue or profit. We rely on the technology and models, proprietary processes, and other intellectual property we own or have rights to use in our analyses and other work we perform for our clients. We use these innovative, and often proprietary, software, analytical models and tools throughout our service offerings. Our staff regularly maintains, updates, and improves these software, models, and tools based on our corporate experience. In addition, we sometimes retain limited rights in software applications we develop for clients. We use a variety of means to protect our intellectual property.
EMPLOYEES
 As of December 31, 2018, we had more than 6,000 benefits-eligible (full-time or benefits eligible) employees, approximately 34% of whom held post-graduate degrees in diverse fields such as social sciences, business and management, physical sciences, public policy, human capital, information technology and mathematics, engineering, planning, economics, life sciences, and law. Approximately 80% of our employees held a bachelor’s degree or 
 15

equivalent or higher. Our professional environment encourages advanced training to acquire industry-recognized certifications, rewards strong job performance with advancement opportunities, and fosters ethical and honest conduct. Our salary structure, incentive compensation, and benefit packages are competitive within our industry.
