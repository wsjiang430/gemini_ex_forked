Our Company - Overview
BuzzFeed is a premier digital media company for the most diverse, most online, and most socially connected generations the world has ever seen. Across food, news, pop culture and commerce, our brands drive conversation and inspire what audiences watch, read, and buy now — and into the future. With a portfolio of iconic, globally-loved brands that includes BuzzFeed, Tasty, HuffPost, BuzzFeed News, and Complex Networks, we are the number one destination for Gen Z and Millennials amongst our competitive set, in terms of time spent, according to Comscore.
BuzzFeed’s mission is to spread truth, joy, and creativity. We are committed to making the Internet better: providing trusted, quality, brand-safe entertainment and news; making content on the Internet more inclusive, empathetic and creative; and inspiring our audience to live better lives.
BuzzFeed curates the Internet, and acts as an “inspiration engine,” driving both online and real-world action and transactions. Our strong audience signal and powerful content flywheel enable us to create category-leading brands and a deep, two-way connection with our audiences, as well as high-quality content at massive scale and low cost. Working across platforms allows us to adapt content from one platform and innovate around new formats to drive engagement on other platforms. This means we can reach our audiences wherever they are — across our owned and operated properties and the major social platforms, including Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Twitter, and Apple News. In 2022, our audiences consumed more than 620 million hours of content and drove over $500 million in attributable transactions. For additional discussion on Time Spent, refer to Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our strength has always been to adapt our business model to the evolution of the digital landscape. Founded by Jonah Peretti in 2006, BuzzFeed started as a lab in New York City's Chinatown, experimenting with how the Internet could change how content is consumed, distributed, interacted with, and shared. This pioneering work was followed by a period of significant growth, during which BuzzFeed became a household name. Over the last few years, we have prioritized investments to focus on revenue diversification and profitability (on an Adjusted EBITDA basis, a non-GAAP measure as defined in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Our data-driven approach to content creation and our cross-platform distribution network have enabled us to monetize our content by delivering a comprehensive suite of digital advertising products and services and introducing new, complementary revenue streams. 
Our Market Opportunity
We believe that BuzzFeed is positioned to thrive at the intersection of several large and growing markets. As a free, global, cross-platform media network that was born on the Internet, the shift to “all things digital” presents multiple opportunities for growth in our business. The growth in digital advertising, the demand for high-quality, brand-safe content, the need for advertisers to reach audiences at scale amid an evolving data privacy landscape and e-commerce are the primary industry trends driving our market opportunity.
Table of Contents

Advertising is shifting away from traditional online media, and digital and social video have become core components of ad budgets. Further, with the rise of creator-led video formats such as Reels and TikTok, advertisers are increasingly looking to tap into creator-led marketing opportunities that resonate with large, young audiences. With a broad and diverse roster of creative talent and a comprehensive set of creator-focused tools, technology, and resources, we are a trusted partner to advertisers, helping them execute premium campaigns effectively and efficiently. 
At the same time, reputation, ethics, and quality matter now more than ever. Social platforms can no longer rely on user-generated content and moderation policies, as they are increasingly exposed to liability for allowing toxic and misleading articles, posts, and videos to be posted and shared on their platforms. These platforms need high-quality, brand-safe content, which BuzzFeed is uniquely able to provide at scale. Social platforms are important partners for us, as are the streaming services for which we help drive subscriptions, reduce churn, and market new shows.
Amid the rapidly evolving data privacy landscape, it is becoming increasingly difficult for advertisers to drive returns on the large tech platforms. This reinforces our value proposition. Through our proprietary first-party data, our category-leading brands and our comprehensive suite of ad products, we offer advertisers the tools and contextual alignment needed to effectively and efficiently reach large young audiences without running afoul of emerging data privacy regulations.
The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the annual U.S. e-commerce market to be approximately $1 trillion, representing another significant opportunity for our business. According to research published by MKM Partners in December 2022, U.S. online sales comprised 18% of total retail sales in the fourth quarter of 2022, up from pre-2020 levels, and is expected to reach approximately 25% by 2025. As the e-commerce market grows and consumer choice expands, we are able to provide retailers with an incremental channel for capturing high-quality, actionable consumer traffic. For years young people have continued to come to BuzzFeed, Inc. for culturally relevant content that inspires them to discover new things. We extended this relationship to our commerce business to create trusted shopping content that inspires our audiences to discover new products. This content is led by our editorial team and informed by audience insights, yielding hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions annually. The ability of our content to inspire millions of consumers to transact is what sets us apart.
Our Brands
The Company has built and assembled a portfolio of iconic, category-leading brands for Gen Z and Millennial audiences across food, news, pop culture, and commerce.
Our flagship BuzzFeed brand has become a go-to authority for curating entertainment, pop culture, and the Internet. With articles, lists, quizzes, videos, and original series — our audience comes to BuzzFeed to learn what to watch, read, and buy now — and into the future. 
Our food brand, Tasty, highlights the best of BuzzFeed: shareable content that brings people together on a viral scale. First launched in 2015, Tasty has grown into the largest, most engaged food community on the internet, pioneering the overhead video format that is now ubiquitous across most major food brands.
HuffPost, acquired in February 2021, is a global, Pulitzer Prize-winning media platform for news, politics, opinion, entertainment, features, and lifestyle content. BuzzFeed News, a Pulitzer Prize-winning newsroom created in 2012, is widely read, particularly among a younger audience. 
In December 2021, BuzzFeed, Inc. acquired Complex Networks, a global youth entertainment company that drives culture across music, food, style, entertainment, and sports. With brands like First We Feast, Pigeons & Planes, Sole Collector and Complex — as well as live events, led by ComplexCon — Complex Networks has established itself as a leader in time spent among males aged 18 to 34, according to Comscore.

Our Audience
Our content reflects the voice of the most diverse generation in history, and creates an “inspiration engine” that helps millions explore new things, try unique experiences, and discover novel products. Across our network of brands we reach millions of monthly viewers, who consumed more than 620 million hours of content and drove hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions in 2022. Our cross-platform distribution network gives us the ability to connect with the Internet generations at a massive scale on whatever platform they are using to consume content. We attract and retain audiences as a function of our data driven approach to content creation. As audiences engage with our content, we capture insights into their preferences and apply those learnings to new content development. This enables us to attract larger, more engaged audiences and capture deeper, more reliable insights.
Our Technology Platform and Data-Driven Content Flywheel
Creating meaningful content requires data, technology, and scale, all of which are key competitive differentiators that BuzzFeed uses to reach our audience wherever they are. Our data-driven approach to content creation is designed to benefit all stakeholders across our ecosystem: audiences, creators, advertisers and social platforms.
BuzzFeed began as a lab in New York City, experimenting with content, formats, and distribution on the Internet. Over 15 years, we have established a deep understanding of modern media and developed proprietary technology designed to rapidly scale and monetize digital content. Machine learning and analytics power everything from our scaled tech stack of quiz makers built into a content management system to proprietary algorithms and custom tools for content creators and brand advertisers to headline optimization.
Supported by our highly scalable and repeatable technology platform, our data-driven content flywheel informs our most important decisions, from investment in individual pieces of content to large-scale acquisitions. In tandem, our cross-platform distribution model maximizes audience reach and revenue opportunities. Our content and brands are ubiquitous, platform-agnostic, and designed for modern-day consumption patterns, providing engagement behavior data and learnings across the BuzzFeed network. With this distribution strategy driving scale, efficiency, and adaptability, we capture the interests of our audience, inform our content creators and journalists, help advertisers reach their target audiences, and provide high-quality brand-safe content to the social platforms.
Our differentiated model for content creation and distribution is designed to serve all stakeholders in our ecosystem.
•These proprietary tools and technologies ensure we are serving our audiences compelling, culturally relevant content regardless of platform.
•Our content creators and journalists also benefit greatly, as internal dashboards and metrics provide heightened visibility on audience interaction, allowing them to focus on content and formats that maximize engagement and revenue.
•Similarly, advertisers rely on our audience insights and first-party data tools to optimize their ad campaigns.

•Our data-driven approach to content creation also resonates with the large social platforms seeking an alternative to user-generated content.
Our Business Model
Powered by our highly scalable data-driven content flywheel, BuzzFeed has grown into a large scale, global media company that distributes content across owned and operated, as well as third-party, platforms. In recent years we have leveraged our media network to develop a comprehensive suite of digital advertising products and services and extend into complementary business lines such as long-form content development and commerce.
We measure our success in terms of engagement, monetization, and operating efficiency using three metrics. The first is audience time spent across owned and operated sites as well as on third-party platforms. The second is revenue generated from advertising, content and commerce and other. The third key measure of our success is profitability (on an Adjusted EBITDA basis, a non-GAAP measure).
We generate revenue from advertising, content, and commerce and other.
Advertising includes display, programmatic and video advertising on our owned and operated sites and applications, as well as third-party social media platforms. This revenue source is driven by our industry-leading engagement, an overall shift to digital advertising, and our scaled reach to multiple demographics. We provide significant and differentiated value to advertisers by consistently delivering best-in-class audience engagement, with the most time spent among Gen Z and Millennial audiences as compared to other digital media competitor companies, according to Comscore. Major platforms recognize the value of BuzzFeed’s brand-safe content, award-winning journalism, and the ability to engage large and diverse audiences, making us a critical and trusted partner for advertisers.
Content includes paid or sponsored branded, syndicated, and studio content (including feature films) that is sold or licensed to third parties. Our content production approach increasingly allows for turn-key, lightweight options that are scalable and repeatable, with strong retention among advertisers. Our content revenue is driven by continued investment in our content team, a strong data-informed understanding of our audience, demand for trusted, brand-safe digital content, and our brand integrity.
Commerce and other includes affiliate marketplace revenue, IP licensing and an experiential business, such as ComplexCon. Our editorial shopping content drives hundreds of millions of dollars in attributable transactions each year. Moving forward, we plan to continue to onboard new marketplaces beyond consumer retail, expanding into new shopping categories to drive additional growth. With strong brand recognition and audience trust, BuzzFeed is well positioned to capitalize on the continued shift to online purchases.
Our Differentiation
•Technology and Content Flywheel — Our proprietary machine learning and analytics tools and technologies enable us to create and optimize content across platforms and capture vital first-party data regarding audience preferences and valuable cross-platform insights. We also continue to experiment with the newest technologies, such as AI, to further enhance our content development capabilities.
•Leading Brands and Attractive Audiences at Scale — Our portfolio of iconic brands reaches the Internet generations with unprecedented levels of connectivity and engagement, helping millions explore new things, try new experiences, and discover new products.
•Comprehensive Offering for Advertisers — Our comprehensive suite of advertising products and services position us as a one stop shop for advertisers looking to reach young audiences at scale in a contextual, brand-safe environment.
•Creativity and Innovation — BuzzFeed lives at the intersection of technology and creativity, continually pushing the bounds of inspiration and innovation, attracting, retaining and supporting creators with the data-enhanced tools they need to continue to stay ahead of trends and shape popular culture. As the creative process becomes increasingly technology enabled, we are continually looking to maximize the creativity of our writers, creators and producers by incorporating new technologies, including AI. Taken together with our proprietary technology and 
Table of Contents

first party data, AI has the potential to unlock a new era of creativity by expanding beyond curation to assist in content creation. 
•Leadership Team — BuzzFeed is founder-led and future-focused, staying at the forefront of modern media through the leadership of Jonah Peretti and a core management team with decades of industry experience.
Our Growth Strategy
•Continue to grow and engage audiences — We plan to continue to leverage our iconic brands and invest in our technology and data-driven content flywheel to deliver engaging content that brands and advertisers trust to reach, grow, and engage audiences, at scale and across platforms. There is a significant opportunity to further penetrate our existing customer base with our diverse offerings, as well as to add new customers through our proven ability to reach audiences at scale and drive awareness, inspiration, and transactions.
•Empower our content creator teams — We are extremely fortunate to have so many talented journalists, video creators, writers, and Internet visionaries, whose contributions are critical to our success. BuzzFeed will continue to focus on building the future of creative work by empowering our teams, providing them with next-generation tools, data, and an environment that fosters collaboration, diversity, and innovation to produce best-in-class digital content.
•Expand strategic partnerships — Our diversified and complementary advertising, content, and commerce offerings have enhanced our value proposition and strengthened our relationship with our customers. In particular, partners who purchase several of our solutions often increase their average spend with BuzzFeed, which drives longer term relationships and improves customer retention.
•Drive sustainable, profitable growth — Following several years of discipline and cost management initiatives, our business is benefiting from significant operating leverage. As BuzzFeed’s future revenue growth accelerates, we expect our profitability margins to continue to expand as our cost base grows at a slower pace than revenue.
•Platform for inorganic growth — Over time, we believe BuzzFeed will play a leading role in consolidating a fragmented digital media landscape. With the addition of HuffPost and Complex Networks, we are demonstrating the ability to enhance reach, engagement, and monetization of subscale brands by extending our infrastructure, proprietary technology, and content creation capabilities. We will continue to look for strategic opportunities to bring additional subscale brands with loyal, complementary audiences to our portfolio in the future.
Competition
BuzzFeed operates within the digital media space, a category that we have pioneered and helped develop. We broadly compete against other Internet companies that might attract audiences and advertisers to their platforms and away from BuzzFeed’s. This includes publicly traded digital publishing companies such as IAC, Ziff Davis, and The New York Times Company. More specifically, with a common core demographic of Millennials and Gen Z, online content providers that target younger generations are natural competitors to BuzzFeed. Historically these have included privately held digital publishers such as Vox Media, which combined with Group Nine Media, Vice Media Group, and Bustle Digital Group, among others. We believe that scale, reach, and ultimately engagement serve as the key indicators of competitive positioning, and BuzzFeed outperforms its peers in each respect, with more time spent across target segments of our audience. Furthermore, we believe that our proprietary technology platform, data-driven content flywheel, and rich first party data are structural differentiators that set us apart from the competition.
BuzzFeed both competes with and partners with the large social media platforms, streaming services and traditional publishers. We believe that BuzzFeed’s unique, data-informed, brand-safe content is increasingly valued by ecosystem participants and enables BuzzFeed to grow alongside the largest consumer Internet and publishing businesses.
Customers
BuzzFeed offers a strong value proposition to customers and business partners looking to reach Millennial and Gen Z audiences at scale, in order to generate awareness and drive discovery, inspiration, and ultimately transactions involving their products and services. Customers rely on our high-quality, engaging and brand-safe content, creativity, and reach across multiple platforms to accomplish these objectives. Our customer base consists of global corporations and 
Table of Contents

companies across a variety of industries including, among others, media and entertainment, consumer packaged goods, and retail, financial services, insurance, and technology, who utilize one or more of our offerings in advertising, content, and commerce and other.
We provide our advertising customers a broad array of offerings including display, programmatic, and video advertising inventory to target users on our owned and operated sites, applications, and social media platforms. Our content customers include third parties seeking to promote their businesses, products and services with our content — we can create customized promotional content for a third party’s film release. Our commerce customers are e-commerce operators who partner with us through affiliate programs, or retailers with whom we enter into licensing and merchandising agreements. Customers can achieve the best results when tapping into a combination of our offerings, and we see increased retention from those customers that do so. We maintain a diverse customer base and do not have a significant concentration of revenue around any particular customers, with our top 10 direct customers making up approximately 17% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition to these top 10 direct customers, we derive a significant portion of our revenue from companies such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon through their various advertising and affiliate exchanges.
Human Capital Resources
Our Employees
We consider the management of our global talent to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,368 employees located across seven countries. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 9.8% of our employees were unionized, with certain employees associated with BuzzFeed News in the U.S. belonging to NewsGuild, certain employees associated with BuzzFeed Canada, Inc. in Canada belonging to the Canadian Media Guild, and certain employees associated with The HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. in the U.S. belonging to the Writers Guild of America, East.
In December 2022, we announced plans to reduce expenses by implementing an approximately 12% reduction in our then-current workforce, which resulted in a reduction of 172 employees in 2022.
We are focused on supporting our employees across the full employee lifecycle from recruitment to onboarding through ongoing development, and have implemented programs designed to support both career satisfaction and overall wellness.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted programs and policies that support flexibility as our employees navigate their personal needs. In February 2022, we announced that we would extend the option to work from home when and where possible. We also offer access to a range of wellness services addressing mental health, family support, child care, and other areas.
Our Culture
At BuzzFeed we value openness and collaboration, experimentation and growth, and diversity and equality. This is demonstrated through our content, as well as in the way we work together within the company. We aspire to provide outstanding people experiences, through our workplace practices, benefits, employee programs, communication, and diversity.
•We believe in having a direct relationship between employees and management where ideas are shared and both work together toward a common purpose.
•We believe in the principle of equal pay for equal work and having compensation programs that provide for such equality.
•We believe in treating each other respectfully and employing principles of fairness when concerns or problems arise.
•We are committed to demonstrating diversity of thought, background, and experience across all functions and levels.
Table of Contents

•We believe in supporting the wellness of our employees and their dependents, in championing progressive changes where needed and adjusting our policies to address the changing needs of employees.
•We believe that people should be able to bring their whole self to work, and feel that the workplace is supportive and inclusive.
Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging
At BuzzFeed, we value Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging (“DI&B”) and strive to weave this value into everything we do. We attract a diverse group of employees that reflect the world we are trying to reach through our content and we welcome the unique skills, experiences, and backgrounds each employee brings to the table every day. Since 2014, we have been committed to holding ourselves accountable to this work by publishing our diversity and demographics report annually. As of December 31, 2022, Black, Indigenous and People of Color (“BIPOC”) employees constituted 43% of our U.S.-based employee population. In addition, 60% of our global population identify as female.
We continually refine our approach to hiring, training, career development, and education to support our mission of DI&B. Our recruiting team continues to be intentional about our diversity strategy to ensure that BIPOC talent and candidates from other underrepresented groups are actively recruited, and that the company hires and retains talent with diverse perspectives and backgrounds. In the recruitment and hiring process, we also emphasize educating all team members involved about internal and unconscious biases and how to overcome them, and ensuring that all job descriptions and interview processes are inclusive and accessible. BuzzFeed is committed to increasing the representation of BIPOC employees within senior leadership; we have concentrated our efforts to both advance and retain current BIPOC employees, and recruit and attract more BIPOC candidates for senior roles.
We are committed to ensuring our culture allows employees to bring their authentic selves to work every day. We want all employees to feel safe and supported, without threat of microaggressions or bias.
In 2022 we have, and in 2023 we will continue to, develop and launch key educational opportunities, including Identity and Allyship training, and host a myriad of Heritage Month educational events, learning opportunities, and social events sponsored by the DI&B team, BuzzFeed employee resource groups, and the DI&B Council.
Intellectual Property
We depend on our iconic brands to build and maintain household name recognition and audience loyalty, and regard our intellectual property as critical to our success. We own numerous domestic and foreign trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business and protect those rights in our brands including, but not limited to, BuzzFeed, Tasty, HuffPost, BuzzFeed News, and Complex Networks. We also maintain rights to the domain names www.buzzfeed.com, www.tasty.co, www.huffpost.com, www.buzzfeednews.com, and www.complexnetworks.com, among others. We retain the rights to an extensive content library that is monetized through multiple revenue streams. In addition to our brand, domain, and content assets, we have a proprietary technology platform that powers our business. We rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, a combination of work for hire, assignment, license and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, trade dress, domain name, copyright, trade secret and patent laws, to protect our brands, content, proprietary technology, and other intellectual property rights.
As of December 31, 2022, we held 320 registered trademarks in the U.S., including the BUZZFEED mark, the HUFFPOST mark, and the COMPLEX mark, and also held 646 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and our ability to register new intellectual property, and whether to decommission certain of our intellectual property assets. We intend to continue to file additional applications with respect to our intellectual property assets.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to many laws and regulations in the U.S., Canada, the European Union (the “EU”), the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”), Japan, Australia, India, and Mexico and throughout the world, including, but not limited to, those related to contracts, securities, privacy, data protection, content regulation, intellectual property, consumer protection, e-commerce, marketing, advertising, messaging, rights of publicity, libel and defamation, health and safety, employment and labor, bribery and corruption, economic and trade sanctions, product liability, accessibility, competition, and taxation. 
Table of Contents

These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended in a manner that could harm or require us to change our current or future business and operations. In addition, it is possible that certain governments may seek to block or limit use or distribution of our products and services or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect access to or operation of any or all of our products and services for an extended period of time or indefinitely.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
We are subject to various federal, state and international laws, policies, and regulations relating to the privacy and security of personal data, including personal data of consumers, customers, and employees. These laws often require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of data (such as personal data, “special categories of personal data” or employee data), and/or impose specific requirements relating to the collection or other processing of such data.
In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Department of Commerce, and various states continue to call for greater regulation of the collection and processing of personal data, as well as restrictions for certain targeted advertising practices. Section 5(a) of the FTC Act grants the agency enforcement powers to combat and address “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce,” and the FTC has used this authority extensively to hold businesses to fair and transparent privacy and security standards. Numerous states have also enacted, or are proposing legislation to enact, state-level data privacy laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, and other processing of personal data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CCPA”) provides specific privacy rights to consumers residing in the state and imposes a range of compliance obligations on covered businesses. Compliance with the CCPA has caused, and will continue to cause, BuzzFeed to incur compliance related costs and expenses. Additionally, a number of other states have adopted or are considering similar legislation, including Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah. Future changes in laws and regulations throughout the U.S., at both the federal and state levels, could impact our ability to collect data, exploit the data we do collect, limit the extent to which we can monetize that data, give rise to additional compliance costs, require us to make substantial investments in technology tools to satisfy new regulatory rules, and expose us to potential non-compliance liability. We are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which includes requirements with respect to website accessibility. Additionally, we are subject to the CAN-SPAM Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and the Video Privacy Protection Act, each of which may place restrictions on how we operate in a manner that adversely affects our business.
In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) imposes stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including with respect to data subject rights, notices and disclosures to data subjects about how personal data is processed (including information about the profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making), records of processing activities, limiting retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification to data protection regulators or supervisory authorities (and in certain cases, to the affected individuals), and requirements to implement additional policies and procedures to comply with the accountability principle under the GDPR. The GDPR is intended to create a single legal framework in relation to the collection, control, use, sharing, disclosure, and other processing of personal data. However, the GDPR allows for derogations where EU member states can deviate from the requirements in their own legislation, including for example, by introducing measures that apply in specific situations and implementing rules regarding legal basis of processing. It is therefore likely that, where we operate or provide services in those EU member state jurisdictions, we will need to comply with these local regulations in addition to the GDPR. Local supervisory authorities are able to impose fines for non-compliance and have the power to carry out audits, require companies to cease or change processing, request information, and obtain access to premises.
Similarly, many other countries around the world have developed laws, rules, and regulations regarding privacy and data protection, including, for example, the U.K., Canada, Japan, Australia, India, and Mexico. Additional countries are developing or expanding privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, or may do so in the future, which could increase our risk and compliance costs.
Countries around the world also have developed or are developing laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data. This includes laws relating to the transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) and the U.K. Recent legal developments in the EEA and the U.K. have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA and the U.K. to “third countries,” especially the U.S. For example, in 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU (the “CJEU”) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (a mechanism for the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the U.S.). The CJEU also made clear that reliance on standard 
Table of Contents

contractual clauses (another mechanism for the transfer of personal data outside the EEA) alone may not be sufficient in all circumstances. We currently rely on standard contractual clauses and these changes are therefore causing us to review our current compliance approach. Changes to our compliance scheme may be deemed necessary to meet the requirements of the EEA, the U.K., and other jurisdictions may result in additional costs or the inability to transfer personal data out of certain countries.
We are also subject to evolving privacy laws on cookies and e-marketing. In the EU and the U.K., regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem and current national laws that implement the EU directive known as the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002/58/EC on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the ePrivacy Directive) are expected to be replaced by a forthcoming EU regulation known as the e-Privacy Regulation, which will significantly increase fines for non-compliance. Informed consent is generally required for the placement of a cookie or similar technologies on a user’s device and for direct electronic marketing. The GDPR also imposes conditions on obtaining valid consent, such as a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents are sought for each type of cookie or similar technology. The text of the e-Privacy Regulation is still under development, and recent EU regulatory guidance and court decisions have created uncertainty about the level to which such laws and regulations will be enforced, which may require us to review our compliance approach and increase compliance costs.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to some seasonal influences. Historically, our revenue is typically highest in the fourth quarter of the year due to strong advertising spend and consumer spending during this quarter.
