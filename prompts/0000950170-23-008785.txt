Airgain Integrated represents our fully integrated products, such as our asset trackers,5G connectivity solutions, and AirgainConnect® platform, that help solve connectivity issues in an organization’s operating environment. Our mission is to connect the world through optimized, integrated wireless solutions.
 Airgain’s core business primarily focuses on the following three key markets:
 •Enterprise. The enterprise market is characterized by devices that provide reliable wireless access for high-density environments such as buildings, campuses, transportation terminals and stadiums. Within this market our antennas are deployed across a wide range of systems, devices, and applications that include access points and gateways, fixed wireless access infrastructure, small cells, massive MIMO, and remote radio heads. In addition, our embedded modems are deployed across various markets with high demand for connectivity, including packaging and logistics, EV charging, smart city and smart building applications, agriculture, asset tracking, and more. We continue to deploy our asset trackers across a variety of transportation, supply chain, cold chain, and other unique applications and we continue to develop WiFi access and other custom products for multiple commercial uses. 
 •Consumer. The consumer market encompasses a large and growing audience of consumers using wireless-enabled devices. Our antennas are deployed in consumer access points, wireless gateways, Wi-Fi Mesh systems and extenders, smart TVs, smart home devices, and set-top boxes. Additionally, our antennas support a comprehensive array of technologies, including WLAN, Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G and LPWAN. We plan to roll out of our new 5G connectivity product lines, improving 5G access and customer experience through fixed wireless access (FWA) and repeaters for our service provider customers.
 •Automotive. In the automotive market, our products are deployed in a wide range of vehicles in the fleet and aftermarket segment, supporting a variety of technologies that include Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, Satellite and LPWAN. The fleet and aftermarket segment of the automotive market typically consists of applications whereby rugged vehicular wireless routers are paired with external antenna systems to provide connectivity to fixed and mobile assets. Within this unique market segment, there has been a rise in the number of antennas per vehicle, which is especially true in the first responder, utility, agriculture, and service fleet markets where in-vehicle equipment increasingly demands connectivity.
 As a wireless connectivity solution provider with a rich history in radio frequency (RF) technology, we are leveraging our expertise in embedded antennas and embedded modems to effectively transition from a component provider to a wireless systems provider. In 2020, we announced our patented vehicle networking flagship platform – AirgainConnect. Our first product from this platform, the AC-HPUE antenna-modem offers a novel solution for our public safety and automotive fleet markets by improving vehicle networking capabilities and we are developing our next generation products directed towards a broader vehicle market size. We have also designed an entire line of cellular-based, ruggedized asset trackers that deliver real-time location and condition data on assets, whether they are indoors, outdoors or in transit. In addition, we have a robust custom products offering where we design and build integrated products such as cellular routers, large venue WiFi access points, and external cellular modem modules for major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Finally, our advanced development team expect to roll out several new products this year designed to improve the 5G customer experience, further helping enable our move into a leadership position in the new wave of technologies and platforms.
 After a significant shift in 2022, we transitioned to a fabless model where we use third parties to manufacture our products while maintaining oversight for critical quality, test, and calibration functions. In addition, we maintain a deliberate intellectual property strategy that includes patent and trademark filings in multiple jurisdictions including the United States and other commercially significant markets. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 281 issued and pending patents worldwide.


Key Differentiators
 While there is significant competition in the wireless connectivity market, we believe that we are able to differentiate ourselves in three distinct areas:
 Simplifying Wireless
 The common thread throughout all of our offerings is our commitment to simplifying wireless connectivity. In engineering circles, RF design can be known as “black magic,” as it is often complex and difficult to optimize. Our foundation was built on complex antenna design, where we would solve for signal issues not only within the device, but within the environment as well. As we added new product lines, this specialty in simplifying wireless became a connecting theme. Whether this includes complex antenna design, end-device certified modems, cellular asset trackers, or signal-enhanced vehicle networking, we help you get connected quickly. Moving forward, our focus is to leverage this core competency to move into a leadership position in the new wave of technologies and platforms as they become increasingly integrated and complex. We believe Airgain is poised to make a significant impact in the wireless connectivity space.
High Growth Technologies
 With a highly experienced RF engineering team on staff, Airgain has expertise in many of the high-growth wireless technologies in the industry including 5G, WiFi 6/6E/7, IoT, FWA and much more. The latest Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) standard is considered a true wired equivalent and can enable higher definition video streaming and services with use cases that require higher data rates. It improves the average throughput per user by a theoretical factor of at least four times over WiFi 5, which will also allow for dense IoT deployments.
According to our research of publicly available data, global 5G connections are doubling every year and are expected to reach 5.9 billion by the end of 2027. Also, we further estimate from our research that 5G service revenue will represent 80% of global operator revenue by 2027. Due to the broader adoption of 5G, the FWA market is expected to grow fivefold by 2028, according to publicly available data, and will account for almost nine percent of all broadband access lines. This uptake is being driven by increased user demand, government support, enhanced data performance, reduced power consumption, user friendliness, and a desire by operators to capture market share in fixed broadband services.
 In addition, while the proliferation of 5G will increase wireless bandwidth significantly, it will also create significant coverage issues, as 5G signals do not travel as far as lower band signals. This will require a significant investment in additional infrastructure by the network operators to deliver adequate coverage to all customers who utilize 5G. While coverage gaps can be resolved by installing additional base stations, this problem can be more affordably solved through the use of smart repeaters and other signal enhancing devices.
 We work closely with leading wireless chipset manufacturers, carriers, hardware manufacturers, software developers, key service providers, and OEMs to remain on the cutting edge of new wireless technologies.
 Breadth of Product Line and Services
 Through our acquisitions over the last several years, we broadened our product portfolio significantly. Not only have these acquisitions increased the overall number of products, but our products now also span the entire value chain from embedded components to off-the-shelf products. Our products are intended to help designers by simplifying the process of building wireless connectivity into their products. Further down the value chain, our products also help fleet managers address connectivity needs for their vehicles where field data needs exist.
 In addition, we expanded our product categories beyond just antennas. While hardware has been our core offering historically, we expanded our offering to include software, data, and services. NLink is a middleware platform working with user software to manage devices remotely, collect device data, and send that data into enterprise software systems through APIs. We also recently launched a network management platform and we are constantly seeking ways to enhance our software offering. In addition, our design, engineering, and testing services help us stand out among component manufacturers, and our data plans offer one-stop connectivity for our customers.
 Products
Our products are found in a broad range of applications and end-user devices that are deployed in carrier, fleet, enterprise, residential, private, government, and public safety wireless networks and systems, including set-top boxes, access points, routers, modems, gateways, media adapters, Wi-Fi extenders, portables, digital televisions, sensors, and fleet and asset tracking devices. Our product portfolio is organized into three distinct sub-brands,

depending on the distinct needs of each end customer. These sub-brands are Airgain Embedded, Airgain Integrated, and Airgain Antenna+.
Airgain Embedded
 This sub-brand is targeted towards design teams, such as design engineers, system architects, and software engineers. Generally, this audience is designing a product that requires connectivity but needs a simplified RF design either due to lack of expertise or resources or is simply looking for a shortened time to market. The products within this brand include:
 •Embedded Antennas - We engage with chipset providers, carriers, original design manufacturers (ODMs) and OEMs to develop highly integrated and customized embedded antenna solutions. While we have over a thousand models of embedded antennas supporting the common wireless standards, our embedded solutions are designed specifically to optimize the connectivity of an individual device, and therefore they are usually unique for that specific customer device as a solution set. It is common practice for us to draw from our existing antenna design library when implementing embedded antenna programs, which drives constant improvement and evolution in performance, while reducing time to market.
 •NimbeLink Embedded Modems – our patented NimbeLink modems are end-device certified, meaning further carrier certifications by our customers are normally unnecessary for intended products. We offer a full line of LTE solutions as well as products with integrated GPS/GNSS radios. All NimbeLink products are 20-pin-compatible, enabling easy integration and simplifying the process of changing technologies in the future as they become available. This time-to-market advantage allows developers to quickly design-in connectivity to cellular networks around the world. We also engage in turnkey design and manufacture of custom modems.
 •Cellular IoT Development Kits – We offer a range of cellular IoT development kits that can help design teams implement rapid prototyping by plugging into most major boards and incorporating major interfaces like Raspberry Pi, Mini-PCI, Arduino, and BeagleBone. Whether for designing a circuit board, adding cellular connectivity to an existing product, or building onto one of today’s sophisticated microprocessors or microcontrollers. Our NimbeLink brand IoT development kits simplify cellular modem connectivity and product prototyping. Our kits allow direct modem connection to a circuit board with everything needed for successful prototyping. Our kits plug into boards from Renesas, Texas Instruments, ST Micro, NXP, and more, offering not just easy addition of a NimbeLink modem but advanced capabilities to complement those of the microprocessor board.
Airgain Integrated
 This sub-brand is targeted toward fleet managers, logistics managers, operations team, IT teams, and other decision makers who are looking to solve critical connectivity issues in their operating environments. We have leveraged our expertise in antennas and cellular modems to shift from exclusively manufacturing components to delivering fully integrated systems that work within your current infrastructure to improve your coverage, enhance your data collection, and deliver a return on investment (ROI). The products within this brand include:
 •Asset Trackers – Our asset tracking solution leverages a cellular backbone with WiFi and GPS triangulation along with a myriad of sensors that include temperature, motion, distance, tilt, humidity, and more to track the location and condition of an asset indoors, outdoors, or in-transit. The focus of our asset tracking solutions is tracking non-powered assets that move around geographically in and out of areas without a local network. The solution combines low power, battery operated edge devices, with its NLink cloud-based device enablement platform, providing an asset tracking solution that can be deployed quickly and in many different applications. NLink is not only able to perform remote-device management and pull data from the devices, but is also able to deliver that data to any enterprise system through a set of open APIs, making it adaptable in any environment.
 •AirgainConnect – In 2020 we introduced the AC-HPUE product, the first antenna-modem from our break-through AirgainConnect platform. The AC-HPUE integrates a high-power LTE modem with high gain antennas in one enclosure to reduce signal loss and support transmission of the maximum allowable radiated power. We are currently developing the next generation products in the AirgainConnect platform, which is intended to address a broader vehicle market size.
 •5G Connectivity – In 2023, we announced a new line of products that address common 5G connectivity issues in order to reduce deployment costs and improve the customer experience. As network operators 


look to compete with broadband providers for home and office internet service, FWA devices provide the connecting link that converts 5G cellular signals to WiFi and ethernet. However, the FWA devices currently in-market do not provide the coverage or signal to remain competitive with existing broadband offerings. Airgain’s outdoor FWA devices provide a much stronger signal along with an easy installation kit and a network management software stack. In addition, as the 5G network grows, it becomes more difficult to provide the same coverage with the existing infrastructure. Airgain’s LighthouseÔ smart repeaters are able to receive the 5G signal, clean up any echo, and power the signal forward. Our unique features, such as beamforming antennas and carrier aggregation, allow the network operators to reduce deployment costs even further.
 •White Label – We also engage in turnkey design and manufacture of white label industrial internet-of-things (IIoT) solution services, enterprise-class wireless products, FWA products, and more.
 Airgain Antenna+
 This sub brand is targeted toward both design teams and end-users looking for the quickest and easiest way to enhance their signal. The Airgain Antenna+ brand, an iteration of our Antenna Plus brand, offers a full line of external fleet, IoT, and fixed antennas that are rugged, reliable, and flexible to meet almost any need. Designed for all environments, our broad range of highly integrated and multi-band products support a variety of applications from kiosk and ATM connectivity to government and public safety vehicular applications. We have over 20 years of experience designing mission critical automotive fleet and mobile antenna applications. As the original inventor of the low-profile cellular antenna, we are known for our market leading performance, quality, and long product life and our antennas connect to almost any vehicular router or modem.
 •Fleet Antennas – A full line of high-performance, low-profile multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fleet and public safety antennas that mount on the roof, trunk, windshield, or dashboard and are optimized for 5G, 4G, Wi-Fi, and GPS. Fleet antennas have a 5-year limited warranty, which is the longest in the industry, and most are IP67 rated and offer flexible connectors to allow for custom cable harnesses.
 •IoT Antennas – A full line of IoT and M2M antennas to fit almost any application, whether you need a simple dipole or paddle antenna or need a ruggedized IP67 MIMO antenna that can mount on almost any surface.
 •Fixed Antennas - Branch antennas for CBRS and lower C-Band that help improve signal to a fixed office or branch, whether in a point-to-point of point or multipoint application.
 Growth Strategy
We are in the process of transitioning from exclusively a component manufacturer to a wireless system solutions provider, targeting higher levels of integration and complexity. Climbing the value curve and expanding our presence in adjacent markets are key ingredients to our growth strategy. In terms of markets, the growth strategy is centered around targeting three key markets: consumer, enterprise and automotive. The consumer market provides foundational revenue, with enterprise and automotive markets representing the primary growth markets. The following graphic provides a summary of our estimated serviceable available market within each of these three

markets. As highlighted in the graphic below, based on publicly available market research and our internal ASP estimates, we estimate a serviceable available market (SAM), to be in excess of $16.5 billion as of the end of 2023.
 

Consumer
 Within the foundational consumer market, most of the revenue comes from designing embedded antenna systems for gateways and routers that are sold to cable multiple system operators, (MSOs). While the MSO companies have faced “cord-cutting” in favor of over-the-top, (OTT), internet-based programming, the cord-cutting trends have not impacted the market for gateways and routers, as OTT devices still need access to the internet in the home through Wi-Fi via the gateway.
The transition towards Wi-Fi 6 standards, and more recently the 6GHz extension to Wi-Fi 6, labelled Wi-Fi 6E, is driving a new wave in device upgrades. The shift toward Gigabit Wi-Fi 6 is creating increased demand for our solutions as the number of antennas per device increases substantially. Given the performance improvements over existing systems, service providers around the world are expediting their upgrade cycle towards higher performing consumer devices, driving a device design refresh cycle.
We continue to penetrate an increasing scope of adjacent wireless device applications within the consumer market such as home security, smart appliances, and connected healthcare devices. We are also expanding our footprint in these markets through support of an increasing range of IoT wireless standards, such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, Thread, NB-IoT and LoRa WAN. Our engineering team provides custom antenna solutions to support a variety of device constraints, including flexible antenna technology for curved and smaller form factors, and specific absorption rate, (SARs), compliant antennas for body worn applications.
With the proliferation of 5G, device connectivity is becoming critical to the user experience. Because of this, Airgain has been focused on developing devices that improve network, commercial, and residential connectivity. We believe FWA is a key application for 5G by allowing cellular operators to compete with wired broadband providers,

and we have begun to establish a leadership position in this rapidly growing space. We currently offer three options for FWA, which include custom antenna designs for dozens of devices currently on the market, supplementing deployed indoor FWA devices with external antennas for a better signal, and a complete reference design for an outdoor FWA device. The design incorporates directional antennas for optimal signal and includes a software management stack and easy installation kit to make implementation simpler. We plan to offer multiple go-to-market pathways to monetize this design.
 Also, coverage is the foundation for any wireless use case. As network operators shift towards 5G technology, signal strength and distance become growing challenges. Adding enough base stations to provide broad coverage can be cost prohibitive. Airgain has developed a line of smart repeaters that can receive a cellular signal, clean up any echo, and boost the signal, thereby extending the coverage for a much lower cost. The network repeater also offers carrier aggregation, allowing for two different 100MHz bands to be repeated from the same device, providing additional cost savings. These 5G connectivity devices allow Airgain to effectively shift from merely selling products with network operators to selling to operators.
 Automotive
 In the automotive market, the trend towards the ubiquitous connected car and the demand for increasingly complex aftermarket/fleet wireless connectivity solutions, are key growth drivers for us. The automotive market represents a considerable growth opportunity both near and long term. We have a significant portfolio of automotive antenna connectivity solutions, from embedded solutions for OBD II, IHU and connected car gateways, to custom ‘shark fin’ style antennas for automotive applications, mainly targeting mobile and automotive fleet applications for government, public safety, and enterprise applications. The strategy is to continue to leverage the Airgain Antenna+ sub-brand in the North American fleet and public safety automotive aftermarket segments. For longer term revenue growth opportunities, we are pursuing the European and other international aftermarket fleets.
The patented AirgainConnect platform with our initial antenna-modem product, the AC-HPUE, and our future derivatives are expected to be the key growth contributor to the automotive market in the longer term. The AC-HPUE's primary users are first responders, however there are also extended-primary user opportunities from transit agencies, public-utility, tow-truck companies, school districts, state child-protective-services agency, airports, and television/media news outlets. We are developing the next generation AirgainConnect platform products to be carrier independent as well as include additional features that improve functionality and ease of use to address a broader portion of the vehicle market.
Enterprise
 Within the enterprise market, we are targeting new 5G devices, primarily sub-6GHz for integrated smart antenna systems. as well as integrated devices. We are currently developing intellectual property with our 5G and WiFi 6/6E/7 antenna designs. Because of the complexity of integration and unique architectures across a broad range of frequency bands, including CBRS, C-Band, and mmWave, we have developed the ability to not only simplify the RF design, but are futureproofing 5G implementations as well. We expect this trend in 5G-enabled device opportunities to continue to ramp in 2023 and beyond, providing an opportunity for us to capitalize on this rapidly growing market trend. Our strategy in the enterprise Wi-Fi submarket is to focus on custom embedded and external antenna systems for the top global OEMs in this market. We have replicated this success in white label development with both WiFi and cellular devices, offering us a significant opportunity in custom products.
 Massive MIMO is a growing trend in 5G base stations that helps focus the signal and brings drastic improvements in throughput and efficiency. This is accomplished by adding a much higher, or “massive” number of antennas to a base station to improve the performance. Airgain has partnered with major chipset and radio unit manufacturers to build reference designs for massive MIMO antennas that can deliver significant spectral efficiencies over standard MIMO systems. This allows Airgain to target network operators with an even broader portfolio of 5G products and services.
 With the addition of NimbeLink products in 2021, we have greatly expanded our footprint in the enterprise market. As demand for connected products continues to grow, time to market becomes a competitive advantage. Our NimbeLink Embedded Modems save hardware and software designers months of delay and tens of thousands of dollars invested in carrier certification. This appeals to high growth markets such as EV charging, video-surveillance-as-a-service (VSaaS), oil and gas, and heavy equipment. NimbeLink modems also require little RF design knowledge as they are easy to integrate into any product design. With the addition of our standard 20-pin

connector to the board, the device manufacturer is able to add significant flexibility to the overall design with the ability to exchange technologies and module manufacturers to fit the connectivity needs and supply chain demand.
 In addition, our line of asset trackers has increased our market share within the IIoT market by offering a simple way to track the location and condition of organizational assets indoors, outdoors and in transit. By leveraging cellular networks for data transfer, our customers avoid the costly infrastructure needed for various other wireless technologies. In addition to location, our asset trackers come with several built-in sensors that track status such as temperature, humidity, tilt, motion, and others. This greatly expands the use cases for our asset trackers to include cold chain, weights and measures, condition monitoring, and more.
 Every connected product needs a modem and an antenna. Taking advantage of our broad portfolio, including antennas, modems, asset trackers, FWA devices, repeaters, software, custom products, and more, we believe we are able to solve complex problems across the value chain for enterprise customers.
 Key elements of our strategy include:
•Transition from components to solutions – Our primary core business historically was embedded components. This continues to be a significant portion of our business, however with the launch of the AirgainConnect platform, our asset tracking solutions, our 5G devices, and our custom product development, we are transitioning to a wireless connectivity solutions provider. We believe the transition to a wireless solution provider will offer more value to customers, offer higher average selling prices, and drive growth in all three major markets.
 •Implement solution-selling – The expansion of our product line through both organic and inorganic growth has created a large portfolio from which the sales team can draw. Rather than selling individual product lines, we are implementing a solution-selling philosophy that allows for our sales representatives to consult with the customer and then draw from a deep ”cupboard” of products that can help solve the connectivity issues within the organization.
 •Develop into new products and markets – We have invested in a highly experienced advanced development team that is actively developing future products that will serve current and new markets. We will leverage our core competencies in wireless simplification, product innovation, integration, and performance verification to continue to release new wireless connectivity solutions that solve critical needs in the marketplace.
 •International growth – While the largest share of our revenues originate from the United States, the company also has a significant presence in Asia and EMEA. Our team in Asia largely services our OEM and ODM partners; however, we have several opportunities to expand our selling relationships throughout the region. We plan to leverage our technology leadership and global relationships to grow our presence in Europe, APAC, the Middle East, and more. 
 •Recurring revenue – We currently benefits from various sources of recurring revenue that create a foundation of long-term success. These include software, data, testing, services, and licensing. As we expand our revenue models, we will look to grow our sources of recurring revenue so as to create predictable, steady growth.
 •Acquire complementary technologies, assets and companies – The market for wireless solutions is diverse and fragmented. Opportunities arise for acquisition of technologies, assets and companies that would complement our business. We continue to consider acquisitions that will enable us to improve our market footprint, strategic position, and allow us to take advantage of economies of scale through consolidation. 
 Sales and Marketing
 Our sales and marketing organizations work together closely to improve market awareness, build a strong sales pipeline, and cultivate ongoing customer relationships to drive sales growth.
Sales
Our global sales effort consists of direct and indirect sales teams, and indirect channel partners. Our direct sales team consists of inside sales personnel based in the United States, China and Taiwan and our outside field sales teams based in the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea, China, and Taiwan. Our outside field sales teams consist of business, sales, account, technical marketing and program managers, and field application

engineers, (FAEs). Our indirect channel partners consist of distributors, engineering design companies and outside sales representatives. We have also recently begun to develop a presence on several online marketplaces where our target markets shop.
 Our outside sales team is engaged in pre-sales, account management, and creating partnership opportunities with third parties such as service providers and semiconductor manufacturers. They are assigned quotas and have defined sales territories and/or accounts. The sales process includes meeting and qualifying potential programs and customers, and actively managing the planning stage of devices they plan to bring to market. Our FAEs assist these managers by providing technical support to existing customers.
Our indirect channel partners provide lead generation, pre-sales support, product fulfillment and, in certain circumstances, post-sales customer service and support. This channel partner network often co-sells with our inside sales and field sales teams. Our channel provides us with additional sales leverage by sourcing new prospects, providing technical support to existing customers, upselling for additional use cases, and maintaining repeat business with existing customers. These channels provide added coverage to customers and prospects we cannot reach directly.
 Marketing
Our marketing strategy is focused on building a competitive advantage for our brands and products in the marketplace. We target two types of customers. For Airgain Embedded products, such as our embedded antennas and NimbeLink modems, we target design teams within OEMs and ODMs. For our integrated products, such as our asset trackers, 5G connectivity products, and AirgainConnect AC-HPUE, we target end user markets. We use both direct and indirect promotional methods to engage our audiences. Direct methods include advertising, web properties, marketing collateral, email campaigns, paid and organic social media, search engine marketing, media relations, content marketing, direct mail, tradeshows and events, and general lead generation tactics. Indirect methods include co-marketing efforts together with resellers, distributors, system integrators, hardware and software partners, and carriers. Both are areas where we plan to invest greater efforts in the future.
 The three primary goals of the marketing team are to uncover new opportunities in the marketplace, support any existing opportunities currently in the pipeline, and increase deal size by introducing customers and prospects to the breadth of our product line. We continue to see increased benefit from our marketing technology and marketing automation efforts in accomplishing these goals. In addition, digital channels have proven to be more effective in generating additional interest and leads for both the field sales team as well as the channel, so we will continue to shift our focus accordingly.
 Manufacturing and Operations
In the second quarter of 2022, we completed the move of our in-house manufacturing operations to external contract manufacturers and shut down our Arizona manufacturing operations where aftermarket fleet and AirgainConnect products were produced. Since then, all of our manufacturing has been done at contract manufacturers (CMs) located in the United States, China, Vietnam, and Mexico. We have long-term relationships with certain of these CMs, and work together to control raw materials, assembly, test, quality and shipment of our products. We perform quality assurance and testing at our California, Scottsdale and Minnesota facilities and monitor the quality performance of our CMs through quality reports and periodic audits.
 We maintain a close direct relationship with our CMs to help ensure supply and quality meet our requirements. The contract manufacturing services required to manufacture and assemble our products can be satisfied by one or more of our CMs, however it may be time consuming and costly to qualify and implement new CM relationships. If our CMs suffer an interruption in their businesses, or experiences delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations, or we otherwise need to change or add CMs or suppliers, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed, and our business could be adversely affected. Our qualified CMs manufacture products according to our design specification, materials specification, quality standards, and delivery requirements. We have full control and authority over the selection of materials, manufacturing processes, and inspection processes. Since our products manufactured in China are predominantly shipped to ODMs and CMs within Asia, we have not experienced significant impact as a result of the tariffs imposed on exports from China to

the United States. However, the recent supply disruptions and semiconductor and module shortages have had and may continue to have a direct impact on our business.
 Research and Development
We invest considerable time and financial resources in research and development to enhance our design and system integration capabilities and conduct quality assurance testing to improve our technology. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 68 employees and dedicated representatives within our research and development organization representing approximately 48% of our workforce. Our engineering team consists of engineers located in research, design, and test centers in California, Arizona, Texas and Florida, as well as the United Kingdom and China. Our engineering team actively participates in research and development activities to expand our capabilities and target applications for the consumer, enterprise and automotive markets. We expect to continually expand our product offerings and technology solutions over time and to continue to invest significantly in ongoing research and development efforts.
 Seasonality
Our operating results historically have not been subject to significant seasonal variations. However, our operating results are affected by how customers make purchasing decisions around local holidays in China. Although it is difficult to make broad generalizations, our sales tend to be lower in the first quarter of each year compared to other quarters due to the Lunar New Year. The broader economic impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as general weakening economic conditions, may contribute to slower sales. Results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year and these patterns may change as a result of general customer demand or product cycles.
 Competition
Because of our broad product line across several categories in the value chain, our competitive landscape is diverse and rapidly evolving.
 Component Manufacturers
 This category represents companies that manufacture a broad array of components that compete both directly and indirectly with our products. This includes Adant Technologies Inc., Asian Creation Communications Factory, AVX Corporation, Baylin Technologies Inc., Blues Wireless, Fibocom, Fractus S.A., Honglin Technology Group Ltd., MobileMark, Nordic Semiconductor, Panorama Antennas, Parsec Technologies, Inc, Particle Industries Inc., PCTEL, Inc., Pinyon Technologies Inc., Quectel, Sunwave Communications Co., Ltd., Telit, Ublox, Taoglas Limited, Wanshih Electronic Co. Ltd., WHA YU Industrial Co., Ltd, and 2J Antennas USA Corp., among others. While we may choose to partner with some of these manufacturers to deliver products that shorten time to market, customers may also choose to complete the more intricate design work on their own using products manufactured by these companies.
 End-Device Manufacturers
 This category represents companies that manufacture off-the-shelf products that are market ready, such as routers, gateways, cellular adapters, and more. This includes suppliers of vehicle networking platforms and fixed wireless devices such as Cradlepoint, Peplink, Option NV, Assured Wireless, among others. These manufactures can act as customers, partners, or competitors to us, depending on the application and relationship. An end-customer may choose to bypass the design process entirely and purchase an off-the-shelf product to deliver device connectivity rather than embedding our modems and antennas. Our integrated products, such as the AC-HPUE and asset trackers, may compete directly with these off-the-shelf products or enhance their functionality. In addition, our Antenna+ product line is designed to enhance the signal and coverage of many of these devices.
 Solution Providers
 This category represents companies that manufacture a wide variety of products across the value chain that include end-device hardware, software, components, services, and more. This includes Digi International Inc., Multi-Tech Systems Inc., Sierra Wireless, Laird Connectivity, Nextivity Inc., Pulse Electronics, and TE Connectivity, among others. With our shift in business model towards solutions, many of these companies are direct competitors.

While some partnership opportunities do exist, most of these companies strive to solve similar problems as us with their broad portfolios and consultative sales approaches.
 In-house Design and Engineering Teams
 Several of our existing customers, including OEMs and ODMs which design and build complete wireless devices, also have internal resources to design, engineer, and produce antenna and modem solutions. In such cases, we compete against the captive resource of that ODM. Several ODMs, including Arcadyan Technology Corporation, Foxconn Electronics Inc., Gemtek Technology Co. Ltd., and Wistron Corporation, design, manufacture, and sell antennas, in direct competition with us.
 The principal competitive factors in our markets include: price and total cost of ownership as a result of reliability and performance issues; brand awareness and reputation; component performance, such as reliability, range and throughput; ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures; offerings across breadth of wireless products; design and testing capabilities; lead-time and flexibility to rapidly customize solutions to individual customer requirements; relationships with semiconductor/chipset vendors; intellectual property protection; and the ability to solve many complex RF problems across the entire spectrum of broadband connectivity.
 Intellectual Property
 We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our technology. As of December 31, 2022, we had 239 issued U.S. patents covering our products with expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2039, and 8 pending patent applications in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Outside of the United States we have 19 issued patents and 15 pending patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2037, which entail counterparts of U.S. patent applications. The patents consist of several broad areas as summarized by the following patent groups:
•Antenna pattern selection; multiple stations connected to access point; associated methods 
 •Dynamically selected antennas for MIMO systems; 
 •Switched directional antennas; 
 •Antenna assemblies and systems for vehicles;
 •Antennas and systems addressing 5G communications environments.

Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot assure that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of many patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Leading companies in the technology industry have extensive patent portfolios. Third parties, including certain of these leading companies, may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or our customers.

Among the total 141 employees and dedicated representatives, 68 were primarily engaged in research and development, 39 were primarily engaged in sales and marketing, 28 were primarily engaged in general and administration functions and 6 were primarily engaged in manufacturing operations. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, and incentivizing our management team and our employees and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash

incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards to align our interests and the interests of our stockholders with those of our employees and consultants.
