Overview
We are a commercial-stage medical device company focused on transforming the lives of people living with epilepsy by reducing or eliminating the occurrence of debilitating seizures. Our novel and differentiated RNS System is the first and only commercially available, brain-responsive neuromodulation system that delivers personalized, real-time treatment at the seizure source. By continuously monitoring the brain’s electrical activity, recognizing patient-specific abnormal electrical patterns, and responding in real time with imperceptible electrical pulses to prevent seizures, our RNS System is programmed by clinicians to deliver the precise amount of therapy when and where it is needed and provides exceptional clinical outcomes with approximately three minutes of stimulation on average per day. Our RNS System is also the only commercially available device that records continuous brain activity data and allows clinicians to monitor patients not only in person, but also remotely, providing them the data they need to make more informed treatment decisions, thus optimizing patient care. We believe the therapeutic advantages of our RNS System, combined with the insights obtained from our extensive brain data set, offer a significant leap forward in epilepsy treatment. As of December 31, 2022, over 4,000 patients have received our RNS System. We believe our compelling body of long-term clinical data, demonstrating continuous improvement in outcomes over time, will support the continued adoption of our RNS System among the approximately 575,000 adults in the United States with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. We continue seeking indication expansion to, over time, cover the entire approximately 1.2 million drug-resistant epilepsy patients in the United States and may additionally seek to expand our operations to reach the approximately 16.5 million drug-resistant epilepsy patients globally.
Epilepsy is a devastating chronic disorder characterized by a tendency of the brain to produce sudden abnormal bursts of electrical energy that disrupt brain functions and cause seizures. The goal for treating epilepsy is to reduce the number and intensity of seizures that a patient experiences, without causing treatment-related side effects. While antiepileptic drugs are considered first-line treatment and are effective at controlling seizures in a large portion of the epilepsy population, approximately one-third of epilepsy patients are considered drug-resistant because they do not achieve complete seizure control or cannot tolerate the side effects of these drugs. These drug-resistant epilepsy patients struggle with a variety of life-impacting challenges including psychological dysfunction, social stigmatization, reduced quality of life, and increased risk of mortality, and are disproportionately responsible for the approximately $28 billion spent annually on epilepsy care in the United States. 
Epilepsy is further classified into two main categories– focal epilepsy and generalized epilepsy. Approximately 60% of epilepsy patients have focal epilepsy, which is characterized by electrical discharges that originate in a specific part of the brain. The remaining 40% of patients have generalized epilepsy, which is characterized by widespread electrical discharges that involve the entire brain at once. Our paradigm-shifting RNS System is currently indicated in the United States for use in adult epilepsy patients, meaning patients who are 18 years of age or older, with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, which we believe represents an approximately $26 billion total addressable market. While we are presently focused on this significant market opportunity, we have investigational device exemption, or IDE, approval for clinical trials to evaluate use of the RNS System to treat drug-resistant idiopathic generalized epilepsy and patients between ages 12 and 17 and we may later seek regulatory approval in markets outside the United States. We currently do not believe we will need to modify our RNS System for potential use in generalized epilepsy or in patients under the age of 18; however, we will need to complete clinical studies and obtain FDA approval prior to marketing the RNS Systems for these indications. We also believe that our RNS System may be effective in treating other brain disorders including depression, impulse control disorders, memory disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. We will need to conduct additional studies to determine if any modifications to the RNS System are necessary to address these other brain disorders and to obtain FDA approval for any new indications.
Our commercial efforts are focused on the comprehensive epilepsy centers, or CECs, including Level 4 CECs, in the United States that facilitate appropriate care for drug-resistant epilepsy patients, which may include implantation of epilepsy neuromodulation devices such as our RNS System or the ongoing treatment of patients with 
neuromodulation devices. While most drug-resistant epilepsy patients begin their care at physician offices or community hospitals, we estimate that approximately 24,000 adult drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients are treated in Level 4 CECs in the United States each year. We estimate that this patient pool represents an annual core market opportunity of approximately $1.1 billion for initial RNS System implants, and we expect that it will continue to grow as the number of CECs, including the number of Level 4 CECs, and epileptologists increases, and as more patients are referred to these CECs. Our RNS System has an estimated average battery life of nearly eleven years, an increase from the previous model of the device. The sale of replacement neuromodulation devices provides a recurring revenue stream that is additive to our current $1.1 billion annual market opportunity for initial implants. 
Resective or ablative surgery that removes or destroys the brain tissue at the source of the seizure onset has historically been considered the best treatment option for drug-resistant focal epilepsy. However, resective or ablative surgery carries risk, including neurological risk, and only approximately half of resective or ablative surgery patients are seizure free two years after surgery. We estimate that only approximately 20% of drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients have a focus that is both safe to remove and likely to result in seizure control if removed, and are also willing to undergo the procedure. 
There are currently two other neuromodulation devices, Vagus Nerve Stimulation, or VNS, and Deep Brain Stimulation, or DBS, that are also approved to address the approximately 80% of drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients who are not ideal candidates for resective or ablative surgery. However, we believe the technology attributes of these devices limit their utility in practice. Both VNS and DBS devices stimulate an anatomical target that is not specific to where seizures start and use the same treatment paradigm for all patients, regularly stimulating the vagus nerve in the case of VNS or one specific location deep in the brain in the case of DBS, using a non-varying schedule in an attempt to prevent seizures. These devices stimulate for multiple hours per day, increasing the occurrence of stimulation-related side effects such as memory impairment, depression, sleep disruption, and vocal disturbances. Additionally, neither of these devices record the brain electrical data known as intracranial electroencephalograms, or iEEGs, that we believe are important to physicians in helping guide the therapy decisions that improve patient results over time. We believe there is a significant unmet need for a personalized, targeted therapy that collects brain data and improves outcomes over time without causing stimulation-related side effects or presenting the neurocognitive risks that are associated with resective or ablative surgery. 
We developed our RNS System to address the individualized nature of drug-resistant epilepsy and deliver a safe and effective therapy for focal onset seizures anywhere in the brain. Unlike other neuromodulation devices, our RNS System continuously monitors the brain’s electrical activity, recognizes patient-specific abnormal patterns, and delivers treatment at the seizure source when needed, providing significant, sustained, and improving reductions in seizure frequency, including, in some cases, eliminating seizures, without stimulation-related side effects at therapeutic settings. As such, we believe our RNS System is superior in tolerability and efficacy to other neuromodulation approaches, gathering insights from individual patients’ brain activity which help clinicians in making better treatment decisions and optimizing patient care. In addition, the non-destructive, reversible nature of the implant procedure makes it an attractive option for drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients, the majority of whom are not candidates for, or are unwilling to undergo, resective or ablative surgery.
The key efficacy and safety benefits of our RNS System are demonstrated by four multi-center FDA approved prospective clinical studies that collectively include approximately 600 patients with up to nine years of follow-up, as well as multiple retrospective studies reporting real-world outcomes. Evidence generated from patients enrolled in our initial clinical studies demonstrated a 44% median reduction in seizure frequency at one year that improved to a 75% median reduction at nine years, with enduring improvements in quality of life and cognition. Importantly, the more real-world results from a post-approval retrospective study published in 2020 showed a median seizure frequency reduction of 67% at one year (p<0.05), which is consistent with the interim one year results of our ongoing prospective Post-Approval Study, increasing to 82% at three or more years, demonstrating the utility of our unique brain data set in driving improvements in therapy effectiveness across patient cohorts over time. Over the 2,500 patient implant years reported in our prospective studies, our RNS System has been shown to be well tolerated without any adverse stimulation-related side effects at therapeutic settings. We believe our extensive and growing body of clinical data is being used to improve patient outcomes, which we believe will support increased adoption.
We received Pre-Market Approval, or PMA, from the FDA for our RNS System in late 2013 and began the commercial rollout of our RNS System in early 2014. We market our RNS System in the United States through a direct sales organization primarily to the epileptologists and neurosurgeons who respectively prescribe and implant neuromodulation devices in the approximately 200 Level 4 CECs in the United States. We have established a significant account base at these Level 4 CECs. Given the concentrated and underpenetrated nature of our target market, we believe there is a significant opportunity to efficiently drive higher utilization within these centers, grow our account base, and expand our referral pathways to increase the number of drug-resistant patients referred to Level 4 CECs with accelerated salesforce expansion.
The implant procedure for our RNS System and the ongoing patient treatment provided by clinicians, including monitoring and programming, are reimbursed under well-established physician and hospital codes. In addition, we believe that our RNS System is currently the only neuromodulation system for epilepsy with reimbursement available for periodic in-person or remote review of brain activity data. Given the relatively young average age of our patient population, our payor mix has historically been more heavily weighted towards commercial payors. As of December 31, 2022, commercial payors have written positive coverage policies that address over 200 million covered lives in the United States. Medicare and Medicaid also routinely provide coverage for implantation of our RNS System and follow-up care. Based on our experience, less than 1% of potential RNS System patients have been unable to undergo an implant procedure with our RNS System due to lack of payor coverage. We believe the established, differentiated, and favorable reimbursement paradigm for our RNS System will continue to support its broad commercial adoption.
Our near-term research, development, and clinical efforts are focused on continuing to improve therapy effectiveness, enhance the patient and provider experience, and expand the population of patients that can be treated with our RNS System. Our near-term product development pipeline includes enhanced offerings that leverage our extensive brain activity database and our advanced data analysis capabilities. We are also pursuing studies to support label expansion for our RNS System in additional epilepsy populations.
We have experienced considerable revenue growth since we began commercializing our RNS System. Our revenue increased from $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $45.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing growth of 23% over this time period despite being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in 2020.
Competitive Strengths 
We are focused on transforming the lives of people living with epilepsy by developing, manufacturing, continuously improving, and commercializing our innovative and clinically-validated RNS System that we believe offers significant advances in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. We believe our continued growth will be driven by the following competitive strengths:
•Novel and differentiated closed-loop, brain-responsive technology that provides targeted, personalized care. Our RNS System is the first and only commercially available brain-responsive neuromodulation system that can be programmed by clinicians to deliver personalized treatment to the seizure source, based on an individual patient’s unique brain activity. Our RNS System continuously monitors the brain’s electrical activity and recognizes patient-specific abnormal electrical patterns that precede the onset of seizures. Our RNS System then uses that information to “close the loop” by responding in real time with imperceptible electrical pulses to prevent seizures at their source. This enables our RNS System to deliver therapy precisely when and where it is needed, providing exceptional outcomes with approximately three minutes of stimulation on average per day. As such, we believe our RNS System offers material efficacy and tolerability advantages relative to alternative neuromodulation approaches, offering clinicians insights based on their patients’ brain activity which help in making better treatment decisions and optimizing patient care. In addition, the non-destructive, reversible nature of the implant procedure makes it an attractive option for drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients, the majority of whom are not candidates for, or are unwilling to undergo, a resective or ablative brain surgery. Through its unique capabilities, we believe our revolutionary RNS System has the potential to transform the treatment paradigm for the approximately 1.2 million individuals in the United States with drug-resistant epilepsy. 
We plan to continue to leverage our technology to establish our RNS System as the standard of care for these patients.
•Unique data recording capability that has generated an extensive database of detailed brain activity information. Our RNS System provides insight into a patient’s dynamic brain activity from iEEG data recorded over time by our neurostimulator. It is the only commercially-available device that provides continuous information on brain electrical activity specific to epilepsy and detailed recordings of iEEGs to help clinicians make more informed treatment decisions and optimize their patients’ care. These data are recorded by our RNS System and can be viewed by the physician during regular patient visits using the Physician Tablet or on demand through a secure website. Our RNS System gathers objective and actionable information about an individual patient’s condition, seizure patterns, and treatment effectiveness which clinicians can utilize to optimize patient care. We believe our RNS System offers a significant leap forward relative to current practice for epilepsy treatment in which clinicians rely on patient-reported seizure data which are often unreliable and incomplete. As of December 31, 2022, over 4,000 epilepsy patients have received our RNS System, yielding an extensive database of over twelve million iEEG records. We believe that we are able to continue to learn and innovate by leveraging this database and our data analytics capabilities, thereby improving and enhancing our products and creating actionable insights for clinicians that improve clinical outcomes for patients. 
•Compelling body of long-term clinical data that continues to demonstrate improved outcomes over time. The efficacy and safety benefits of our RNS System are supported by nearly 2,500 patient-implant years of data from approximately 600 patients enrolled across four multi-center FDA approved prospective studies, in addition to multiple retrospective studies reporting real-world outcomes. Evidence generated in studies provides nine years of follow-up data resulting in the largest and longest published prospective neuromodulation data set in the field of epilepsy. These studies demonstrate that our RNS System provides significant, sustained, and improving reductions in disabling seizures with enduring improvements in quality of life and cognition. In our randomized, controlled Pivotal Study, patients experienced a median reduction in seizure frequency of 44% after the first year. The patients from our Feasibility Study and the Pivotal Study, all of whom received implants prior to 2010, were followed in a Long-Term Treatment Trial, or LTT, in which outcomes improved to a 75% median reduction in seizure frequency at nine years, demonstrating the ability of our closed-loop therapy to improve outcomes in the same set of patients over time. Additionally, we believe the insights obtained from our extensive brain data set are driving improvements in overall therapy effectiveness across patient cohorts over time. For example, the real-world results from a post-approval retrospective study of patients treated across eight epilepsy centers published in 2020 showed a statistically significant median seizure frequency reduction of 67% at one year (p<0.05), which is consistent with the interim one-year results of our ongoing prospective Post-Approval Study, increasing to a median reduction in seizure frequency of 82% at three or more years, the highest published seizure frequency reduction for any neuromodulation study. Our studies have also collectively demonstrated that our RNS System is well-tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of other brain neurostimulator implant procedures, and a lower rate of dying from sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, or SUDEP, relative to other treatment-resistant epilepsy groups. Unlike other neuromodulation devices for epilepsy, which have been shown to negatively impact sleep, mood, memory, and vocal characteristics, our RNS System is not associated with adverse stimulation-related side effects at therapeutic settings. We believe our extensive and growing body of clinical evidence will continue to support increased adoption of our RNS System.
•Efficient commercial model supported by a specialized and focused field team. Our initial target patient population of U.S. adults with drug-resistant focal epilepsy is treated in Level 4 CECs that provide advanced diagnosis and management of epilepsy. We estimate that there are approximately 200 of these Level 4 CECs in the United States. Our commercial organization of Therapy Consultants and Field Clinical Engineers has established a significant account base across these CECs, and remains focused on driving utilization within these centers, increasing the number of implanting Level 4 CECs, and expanding our referral pathways to increase the number of drug-resistant patients referred to these centers. Given the concentrated nature of our target market, we believe there is a significant opportunity for our salesforce to 
efficiently drive continued growth. We believe that our focused and dedicated approach to these CECs has also enabled us to develop deep-rooted relationships with the clinicians that manage our target patient population, which provides a strong established channel for future potential products and indications. 
•Established, differentiated, and favorable reimbursement supporting commercial growth. We believe that both the implantation procedure for our RNS System and the ongoing patient care provided by clinicians, including monitoring and programming, are reimbursed at attractive levels under well-established physician and hospital codes. In addition, our RNS System is currently the only neuromodulation system for epilepsy with reimbursement available for in-person or remote review of iEEG data, which provides a differentiated value proposition for clinicians. Given the relatively young average age of our patient population, our payor mix has historically been more heavily weighted towards commercial payors and, as of December 31, 2022, positive written coverage policies from commercial payors address over 200 million covered lives in the United States. Medicare and Medicaid also routinely provide coverage for implantation of our RNS System and follow-up care. Based on our experience, less than 1% of potential RNS System patients have been unable to undergo an implant procedure with our RNS System due to lack of payor coverage. We believe the established, differentiated, and favorable reimbursement paradigm for our RNS System will continue to support its broad commercial adoption. 
•Strategic approach to our intellectual property portfolio. Our product and technological advantages are supported by a combination of our patent portfolio, trade secrets, and manufacturing know-how. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 122 issued U.S. patents and 20 non-provisional pending U.S. patent applications that included system, device, and method claims covering our differentiated, responsive direct brain stimulation system as well as stimulation and treatment modalities, artificial intelligence, and data analysis methodologies.
•Experienced senior management team. Our senior management team consists of seasoned medical device professionals with deep industry and clinical domain experience. Our team has successfully led and managed dynamic growth phases in organizations, commercialized products, and developed markets in neuromodulation and other therapeutic modalities. Members of our team have worked with well-regarded medical technology companies such as Boston Scientific Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, Guidant Corporation, and Covidien plc. 
Our Growth Strategies
We expect that the near-term growth of our business will be primarily driven by new patients being treated with our RNS System. We believe the following strategies will contribute to growth in initial patient implants and advance our mission to dramatically improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients living with epilepsy and other disabling brain disorders:
•Drive adoption of our RNS System. Our commercial efforts are primarily focused on the Level 4 CECs where drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients are actively seeking treatment. The number of Level 4 CECs in the United States has been growing as more epileptologists are trained and in 2022 there were approximately 200 Level 4 CECs in the United States. Our focused commercial organization consists of Therapy Consultants and Field Clinical Engineers who supported our customers in performing initial implant cases in 2022. Additionally, our sales team has the opportunity to engage with clinicians at programming centers outside of Level 4 CECs to facilitate the continued management of patient care. We believe that with additional resources, our commercial organization will have sufficient capacity to establish relationships with the remaining Level 4 CECs and support their ongoing utilization. Our goal is to establish our RNS System as a standard treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients in all Level 4 CECs by engaging in targeted, efficient sales and education efforts to expand our footprint of CEC accounts.
•Increase utilization of our RNS System within CECs. As we expand our footprint across CECs, we plan to continue to drive increased utilization of our RNS System within new and existing accounts. We expect to accomplish this by (i) growing the number of epileptologists recommending our system within each center, 
(ii) increasing utilization of our system by existing prescribers, and (iii) expanding our referral pathways to increase the number of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy that are referred to CECs for the care that they need. 
◦Growing the number of epileptologists recommending our system: We estimate that there are approximately 1,200 epileptologists affiliated with the approximately 200 Level 4 CECs in the United States and that this number will continue to grow as more clinicians are trained in the specialty. Epileptologists are the clinicians who prescribe the course of epilepsy treatment, including our RNS System. On average there are approximately five to seven epileptologists affiliated with each Level 4 CEC in the United States. Our commercial efforts resulted in prescriptions from approximately one third of the epileptologists in the Level 4 CECs that implanted our RNS System in 2022. We believe the remaining epileptologists in these accounts represent a significant potential opportunity to drive efficient growth. To facilitate adoption by these clinicians, we plan to continue conducting training and professional education programs, facilitating peer-to-peer dialogue and forums, communicating our exceptional clinical results, and releasing product enhancements that simplify the user experience.
◦Increasing utilization of our RNS System by prescribers: While we have achieved significant commercial adoption of our RNS System to date, our target market remains highly underpenetrated and represents a significant opportunity for growth. We estimate that approximately 48% of the 50,000 new drug-resistant epilepsy patients seen at a Level 4 CEC annually are adults with focal epilepsy and that the clinical and technology benefits of our RNS System are such that it is an attractive therapy for many of these patients. We plan to increase penetration of our target market by increasing utilization by the epileptologists that are already actively prescribing our RNS System. We have seen that utilization typically increases once clinicians become familiar with the technology and experience the benefits that our RNS System and long-term iEEG data bring to improving patient care. To drive increased utilization, our Therapy Consultants and Field Clinical Engineers are focused on providing information that epileptologists can reference in developing appropriate patient selection protocols and partnering with epilepsy programs to more fully incorporate our RNS System into their practice. We also engage in collaborative clinical research with epileptologists and neurosurgeons to provide additional data relevant to patient selection, patient care, and RNS treatment approaches.
◦Driving increased referrals of appropriate drug-resistant epilepsy patients to Level 4 CECs: While we estimate that there are approximately 1.2 million patients with drug-resistant epilepsy in the United States, only approximately 50,000 new patients are treated in a Level 4 CEC annually. We believe there is a significant opportunity to increase referrals of patients who could benefit from our RNS System to Level 4 CECs where they can receive specialized care. To accomplish this, we will continue to drive awareness by engaging epilepsy patients and caregivers through our advocacy partnerships and marketing initiatives such as digital and social media campaigns, advertising, patient education, and patient ambassador programs. In addition, we plan to increase awareness of our RNS System amongst clinicians who treat epilepsy patients early in their care, including general neurologists and epileptologists who practice outside of Level 4 CECs, through targeted education and outreach designed to drive patient referrals to Level 4 CECs.
◦Improved visibility into patient pipeline: In August 2022, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement, or the Distribution Agreement, with DIXI Medical USA Corp., or DIXI Medical, pursuant to which we became the exclusive U.S. distributor of DIXI Medical’s product line beginning in October 2022. DIXI Medical is a subsidiary of a European company that pioneered the development of stereo electroencephalography, or Stereo EEG, electrodes and related products. These products are used in the epilepsy monitoring units, or EMUs, of comprehensive epilepsy centers to determine where epileptic seizures originate. In addition to providing us with an incremental revenue stream, the DIXI Medical partnership will provide us with improved visibility of patients moving through the EMUs, many of whom may be candidates for our RNS System. This synergistic partnership leverages our field organization that is already calling on the same customers and supports our objective to engage earlier in the diagnostic and therapy selection process.
•Broaden indications for our RNS System to include patients with generalized epilepsy and patients under age 18. Of the 50,000 drug-resistant epilepsy patients that present at Level 4 CECs in the United States annually, we estimate that approximately 48%, or 24,000, are adults with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who are currently candidates for our RNS System. The remaining patients include approximately 40%, or 20,000 patients with drug-resistant generalized epilepsy and approximately 12%, or 6,000 patients under the age of 18 with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Supported by evidence published in peer-reviewed journals, we believe that our current RNS System may be able to effectively treat these expanded patient populations without significant modifications to our existing product and we are pursuing clinical studies to support label expansion for these indications. We have FDA approval for IDEs to treat both drug-resistant generalized epilepsy as well as drug-resistant focal epilepsy in adolescent patients between ages 12 and 17. We are currently enrolling patients in both studies. We currently do not believe we will need to modify our RNS System for potential use in patients under the age of 18 or in generalized epilepsy; however, we will need to conduct clinical studies and obtain FDA approval prior to marketing the RNS Systems for these indications.
•Expand into international markets. We estimate that the global drug-resistant epilepsy market includes approximately 16.5 million patients, of which the United States represents approximately 1.2 million patients. While we are presently focused on addressing the significant domestic market opportunity, we believe our RNS System offers an attractive value proposition for patients, providers, and payors in the large potential market outside of the United States and may additionally seek to expand our operations to reach the approximately 16.5 million drug-resistant epilepsy patients globally. While our RNS System is not yet approved for sale outside the United States, we plan to pursue regulatory approvals and reimbursement with a priority on markets in which we see significant potential opportunity.
•Pursue additional indications, including outside of epilepsy. We believe our versatile, closed-loop, brain-responsive neuromodulation platform has potential applications in other brain disorders including depression, impulse control disorders, memory disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. For each of these four conditions, we are collaborating with academic investigators in early IDE feasibility studies using our RNS System in patients. In the future, depending on the outcome of these studies, we may seek regulatory approval to commercialize our technology for these or other indications. We will need to conduct additional studies to determine if any modifications to the RNS System are necessary and to obtain FDA approval prior to marketing the RNS Systems for any new indications, including for potential use in treating other brain disorders including depression, impulse control disorders, memory disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Our Market and Industry
Overview of Drug-Resistant Epilepsy
Epilepsy is a devastating chronic disorder characterized by a tendency of the brain to produce sudden abnormal bursts of electrical energy that disrupt brain functions and cause seizures. The symptoms of the seizure depend on the region of the brain from which the discharges arise and the extent to which they spread. If the seizure remains restricted to less than half of the brain, then symptoms may include an alteration in speech, memory, motor, sensory, or vision function. Most often, there is confusion. If the seizures involve all of the brain, there is loss of consciousness. In the most severe case, the patient may have a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which is also referred to as a convulsion or Grand Mal seizure, with uncontrolled jerking of the arms and legs. After the seizure, patients may remain confused and disoriented for minutes or even hours. Seizure-related injuries include burns, head and skeletal trauma, abrasions, lacerations, and potentially life-threatening accidents. 
According to the World Health Organization, approximately 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 3.4 million people in the United States were living with epilepsy in 2015, making it the fourth most common neurological disorder in the United States. First line treatment for epilepsy is antiepileptic drugs, or AEDs. While AEDs can help control seizures for many individuals, approximately one third of patients do not achieve complete seizure control, which is defined as seizure freedom without life-impacting side effects associated with treatment. According to a 2018 article published in JAMA 
Neurology, the chance of achieving complete seizure control after failing two AED regimens is less than 5%. The study concluded that despite the availability of over 15 new drugs in the past decade, overall complete seizure control in newly diagnosed patients has not fundamentally changed. This population of epilepsy patients is referred to as drug-resistant and we estimate that there are approximately 1.2 million drug-resistant epilepsy patients in the United States. 
Drug-resistant epilepsy is a costly disorder in terms of its impact on individuals and their families as well as on society. According to a 2020 article in the American Journal of Managed Care, estimated direct costs of epilepsy in the United States are approximately $28 billion per year, disproportionately accrued by individuals with uncontrolled drug-resistant epilepsy. Importantly, these direct costs do not consider indirect costs from losses in quality of life and productivity, which are estimated to constitute the majority of the cost burden of epilepsy.
Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy struggle with a variety of life-impacting challenges including psychological dysfunction, social stigmatization, reduced quality of life, and increased risk of mortality. The unpredictable nature of seizures limits the ability of patients to live independently, and promotes increased social isolation. Studies have shown that children with epilepsy often receive inadequate schooling, which leads to developmental gaps as these children mature and, for adults, unemployment levels are approximately two to three times higher than the overall population. Based on a social security death index, people with drug-resistant epilepsy have a cumulative probability of death of 8.7% at six years from the time of diagnosis at an epilepsy center, and patients with uncontrolled epilepsy have a nine to thirteen times higher risk of death than patients with epilepsy who are seizure-free. 
Epilepsy can be classified into two categories: focal epilepsy and generalized epilepsy. Approximately 60% of epilepsy patients have focal epilepsy, which is characterized by electrical discharges that originate in a specific part of the brain. Focal epilepsy patients typically have one or two seizure foci, or sites in the brain from which the electrical discharge originates. Generalized epilepsy, which describes approximately 40% of epilepsy patients, is characterized by widespread electrical discharges that involve the entire brain at once.
Onset of epilepsy can occur at any age. Of the approximately 1.2 million patients in the United States with drug-resistant epilepsy, we estimate that approximately 80% are adults, meaning 18 years of age or older, of whom approximately 575,000 have focal epilepsy. The remaining approximately 20% of patients are pediatric, meaning under the age of 18, and we estimate that approximately 145,000 of these pediatric patients have focal epilepsy.
Overview of Epilepsy Care
The National Association of Epilepsy Centers, or NAEC, which is considered the primary accreditation organization for epilepsy centers in the United States, classifies epilepsy care into four levels. Levels 1 and 2 care include an evaluation in a primary care physician’s office or a consultation with a general neurologist while levels 3 and 4 care take place at specialized epilepsy centers called comprehensive epilepsy centers, or CECs. 
CECs are typically tertiary care hospitals that provide specialized epilepsy care. Level 3 CECs generally provide basic neurodiagnostic evaluations and may also offer noninvasive surgical evaluations, straightforward resective or ablative surgery, and implant VNS devices, but do not perform intracranial evaluations or complex resective or ablative surgery. In addition to offering the services performed at Level 3 CECs, Level 4 CECs offer the most comprehensive and complex epilepsy care, including a broad range of surgical procedures for epilepsy. The NAEC recommends that patients whose seizures have not been brought under control after three months of care by a primary care physician or after 12 months of seeing a general neurologist be referred to a Level 3 or Level 4 CEC.
The number of CECs in the United States has grown from approximately 80 Level 4 CECs in 2006 to approximately 200 in 2020. The number of neurologists being trained in accredited epilepsy fellowship programs has increased from twelve in the 2014, when the board certification was created, to 140 in 2020. The figure below shows provider and CEC growth in the United States. 
Today, most drug-resistant epilepsy patients in the United States begin their care at physician offices or community hospitals, with Level 1 or 2 care by primary care physicians or general neurologists. We estimate that approximately 50,000 drug-resistant epilepsy patients are referred to, and treated in, Level 4 CECs annually, of which approximately 48%, or 24,000, are adults with focal epilepsy. 
Our Market Opportunity
Our paradigm-shifting RNS System is currently indicated for use in adults with drug-resistant focal epilepsy and we believe that it is an attractive therapeutic option for these patients. We estimate that there are approximately 575,000 adult drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients in the United States, which reflects a total addressable market opportunity of approximately $26 billion for our RNS System.
Our commercial efforts are focused on the CECs in the United States that provide comprehensive epilepsy care. As such, we view our core annual market as the 50,000 drug-resistant epilepsy patients who present at Level 4 CECs each year, of which 48% are adult drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients. We estimate that this addressable patient pool of 24,000 patients represents an annual market opportunity of approximately $1.1 billion for initial RNS System implants, and we expect that it will continue to grow as the number of CECs increase, the number of epileptologists grows, and as referral pathways are expanded so more patients can be referred to Level 4 CECs. Our RNS System has an average battery life of nearly eleven years, an increase from the previous model of the device, 
which, through the sale of replacement neuromodulation devices, provides a recurring revenue stream that is additive to our current $1.1 billion annual market opportunity. The average age of initial implant patients in our clinical studies was approximately 34 and we expect that many of our patients will return multiple times for replacement procedures over their lifetimes.
Supported by evidence published in peer reviewed journals, we believe that our current RNS System may also be able to effectively treat patients under age 18 with drug-resistant focal epilepsy as well as drug-resistant generalized epilepsy patients and we are pursuing clinical studies to support label expansion for these indications. We have FDA approval for an IDE study to treat drug-resistant focal epilepsy in patients under age 18 and began enrollment for that study in late 2021. In February 2021, our RNS System received Breakthrough Device Designation from the FDA for the treatment of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, or IGE. IGE is a subset of generalized epilepsy, is understood to have a strong underlying genetic basis and constitutes as many as one third of all epilepsies. We believe that this breakthrough designation will help patients living with IGE have more timely access to our RNS System. In the second half of 2021, we also received IDE approval to initiate a clinical study in generalized epilepsy and have begun enrollment.
Based on the additional approximately 6,000 drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients under the age of 18 and approximately 20,000 drug-resistant generalized epilepsy patients that were treated at Level 4 CECs in 2019, we estimate that these patient populations represent total market opportunities of approximately $6 billion and $22 billion, respectively, and annual market opportunities of approximately $270 million and $900 million, respectively for initial implants. The adolescent population, for which we expect to seek indication expansion, represents a subset of the overall pediatric market opportunity.
Current Treatment Alternatives and Their Limitations
There are two primary treatment alternatives for drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients: (i) an ablative or resective surgery to remove or destroy the brain tissue associated with the seizure onset, or (ii) implantation of a neuromodulation device to stimulate seizure-causing brain circuits and prevent or abort seizures. 
Once patients are in the care of a Level 4 CEC, they undergo a diagnostic process to determine whether they have focal or generalized epilepsy. If they have focal epilepsy, the locations of seizure onset are also determined. For patients with only one discrete seizure focus, resective or ablative surgery may be an effective option to eliminate seizure activity if the focus is clearly identified by electroencephalogram, or EEG, and magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, and is safe to resect. However, we estimate that only approximately 20% of drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients meet these requirements and are willing to undergo a surgery. 
For the approximately 80% of drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients who are not ideal candidates for resective or ablative epilepsy surgery, neuromodulation devices are an attractive treatment alternative. The first neuromodulation device approved for epilepsy, which is a VNS device, has been available for over 20 years and, in controlled trials, has demonstrated success in reducing seizure frequency. Interest in neuromodulation devices is rising as our RNS System and DBS have more recently been approved for the treatment of focal epilepsy, and as physicians have become more comfortable with, and experienced in, incorporating neuromodulation devices into their practice. Growing awareness of the risks and limited success of resective and ablative surgery are also driving adoption. The chart below illustrates how physicians may evaluate treatment options for their patients.
Resective and ablative surgery 
Surgery has been used to treat epilepsy for more than 100 years. Resective or ablative surgery is used in current clinical practice as a treatment alternative for the approximately 20% of drug-resistant epilepsy patients who are willing to have the surgery and have a discrete, single seizure focus that is determined to be safe to resect or ablate in a way that is likely to result in complete seizure control. The remaining approximately 80% of patients are unlikely to become seizure-free after a resective or ablative surgery, are at risk for damage to functions such as language, movement, sensation, memory, or vision, or do not want to have resective or ablative surgery. For people with more than one seizure focus or with a large focus, the possibility of meaningful improvement in seizures with resective or ablative surgery is lower and the risks to neurological function are usually higher. If seizures are generalized at onset, then resective or ablative surgery does not offer a benefit. 

Surgical treatment options include focal resection and, more recently, laser ablation. Focal resection procedures are invasive surgeries that involve permanently removing the part of the brain that is primarily responsible for the seizure onset. Laser ablation surgeries, which use thermal energy to permanently destroy brain tissue, have emerged as a less invasive alternative to surgical resection. However, multiple publications have concluded that laser ablation is not as effective as larger resective procedures.

Only approximately 20% of drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients have a focus that is both safe to remove and likely to result in seizure control if removed, and are also willing to undergo resective or ablative surgery. Of those who do, only half are seizure-free two years after surgery and many experience impairment in some aspect of neurological function. The most common and successful type of resective surgery, temporal lobectomy, leaves 30 to 40% of patients with seizures one year after surgery and many patients are left with neurological side effects, including impaired memory, reduced naming ability, and loss of some part of their visual field. 
Implantable neuromodulation devices
In addition to our RNS System, there are two neuromodulation devices that are approved by the FDA to treat focal epilepsy: Vagus Nerve Stimulation, or the VNS System, marketed by LivaNova: and Deep Brain Stimulation, or the DBS System, marketed by Medtronic. Neuromodulation devices offer a non-destructive, reversible treatment option that provides substantial seizure reduction and quality of life improvements, without the risk of neurocognitive deficits associated with resective or ablative surgeries. Unlike AEDs and resective or ablative 
surgery, for which success may decline over time within individual patients, neuromodulation therapies have demonstrated sustained and, in many cases, even improved success over time.

The VNS System was approved by the FDA in 1997 as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The VNS System provides scheduled extracranial stimulation delivered from a pectorally implanted pulse generator with the lead tunneled under the skin to the left vagus nerve in the neck next to the carotid artery. Therapy is typically delivered in a repeating pattern of 30 seconds of stimulation followed by five minutes without stimulation. The most recent commercially available version of VNS provides additional stimulation when the heart rate exceeds a preset limit. Although heart rate increases occur during some seizures, this indicator lags behind the brain activity changes that cause seizures.


The DBS System was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of focal epilepsy. Bilaterally implanted intracranial electrodes are placed in each anterior thalamic nucleus, which have connections to other brain regions. The electrodes are attached to a pectorally implanted pulse generator using connecting wires that are tunneled under the scalp and skin of the neck and chest. DBS delivers non-responsive, sometimes referred to as open-loop, scheduled stimulation and has limited sensing and recording capability. Therapy is typically delivered in a repeating pattern of one minute of stimulation followed by five minutes without stimulation.

Published data from separate prospective FDA approved studies run by LivaNova and Medtronic in adults with focal epilepsy demonstrated that the VNS System and DBS System achieved median reductions in seizure frequency at one year of 35% and 44%, respectively. Both VNS and DBS devices stimulate a fixed anatomical target that is not specific to where seizures start in the brain. They also use the same treatment paradigm for all patients and are intermittently stimulating the brain using a non-varying schedule in an attempt to prevent seizures rather than responding in real-time to the patient-specific electrical activity that precedes a seizure. 
Furthermore, VNS devices do not record brain data for physicians to use to assess seizure burden and treatment effectiveness. While the latest generation of DBS devices do record a limited sample of data, these data are not typically as relevant for epilepsy as they are for movement disorders. Accordingly, physicians generally have to rely primarily on patient self-reported seizure data, which is typically unreliable and incomplete, in order to titrate treatment for individual patients. As such, we believe VNS and DBS devices have limited ability to benefit from the insights afforded by brain data in order to improve patient outcomes.
Additionally, although abnormal electrical activity typically occurs less than 1% of the time in epilepsy patients, VNS and DBS devices stimulate an aggregate of multiple hours per day, regardless of the state of the brain, increasing the likelihood of stimulation side effects. Published data from FDA approved trials for VNS indicate that side effects of stimulation include voice alterations, hoarseness, throat pain, cough, and difficulty swallowing while published data from FDA approved trials for DBS indicate that side effects of stimulation include depression and memory impairment. Other studies of DBS report sleep disruption as a side effect. 
We believe our RNS System addresses the significant unmet need for an epilepsy treatment option that can improve outcomes without causing stimulation related side effects for the large portion of drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients who are not ideal candidates for surgery or who do not want to undergo a destructive surgical procedure. 
Our Solution
Our RNS System, which is a compilation of several of our products, is a paradigm-shifting approach to treating epilepsy that combines the power of continuous iEEG monitoring with responsive neuromodulation. With our RNS System, we offer a personalized treatment option that delivers a safe and effective therapy for focal onset seizures originating anywhere in the brain. We believe our RNS System is superior in tolerability and efficacy to other neuromodulation approaches and provides clinicians with actionable insights based on their patients’ brain activity, facilitating better treatment decisions and optimizing patient care. 
RNS System Overview 
Our RNS System includes our RNS neurostimulator, our cortical strip leads and depth leads, our Patient Remote Monitor, as well as other implantable and non-implantable accessories. As part of the initial implant procedure, the number and configuration of leads implanted as well as the implantable and non-implantable accessories used in the procedure are determined by the clinicians depending on individual patient need and clinician preference and a Patient Remote Monitor is typically included. During a typical replacement implant procedure performed when the battery in our RNS neurostimulator reaches end of service, the RNS neurostimulator is replaced, while the previously implanted RNS leads remain in place and a new Patient Remote Monitor is typically included. Clinicians continue having access to our Physician Tablet and Patient Data Management System, or PDMS, to provide ongoing patient support.
We developed our RNS System to address the individualized nature of drug-resistant epilepsy with a differentiated technology that provides personalized, data-driven treatment. Our RNS System is the first and only closed-loop, brain-responsive neuromodulation device approved by the FDA for treatment of drug-resistant focal epilepsy. By continuously monitoring the brain’s electrical activity, recognizing patient-specific abnormal electrical patterns, and responding in real time with imperceptible electrical pulses to prevent seizures, we believe our RNS System addresses the primary unmet needs in epilepsy care today.

The implantable components of our RNS System include a neurostimulator, which is placed within the patient’s skull, and our RNS System leads with both cortical strip electrodes (on the surface of the brain) and depth electrodes (within the brain) that can be positioned in one or two seizure foci, as well as implantable accessories such as our burr hole cover. The neurostimulator is flush with the patient’s skull, and under the scalp, so that it is not visible externally. Placing the neurostimulator in the skull minimizes external noise and movement artifact so that it is able to sense even the most subtle brain signals and eliminates the need for long tunneled connectors between the chest and head which reduces the risk for breakage, migration and discomfort that can be associated with some other neuromodulation devices.

The electrodes on the leads sense electrical activity from the brain, provide targeted stimulation only when abnormal activity is detected, and record iEEG data that is stored in the neurostimulator and transmitted wirelessly to a secure portal for remote review by the patients’ clinicians. Once fully programmed, patients do not feel the stimulation bursts, which are typically 100 to 200 milliseconds long. Because our RNS System provides targeted, responsive stimulation only when abnormal electrical activity is detected, patients receive approximately three minutes of stimulation on average per day and do not experience stimulation-related side effects at therapeutic settings.
In addition to the implantable components of our RNS System, our RNS System also includes external components such as the Patient Remote Monitor, as well as optional accessories.

Our Patient Remote Monitor is provided to each patient in order to collect and transmit data from the neurostimulator to our Patient Data Management System, a secure online database. It consists of a handheld wand and a specially programmed laptop computer. The patient holds the wand adjacent to the implanted device to wirelessly upload the data from the neurostimulator to the laptop, and then sends that encrypted data to our Patient Data Management System using an internet connection.

Additionally, we provide our Physician Tablet and access to our PDMS for use with our RNS System. 

Our Physician Tablet is used by the prescribing or managing clinicians for programming implanted devices and managing patient care. Using the tablet’s simple, intuitive interface, the clinician retrieves and reviews iEEG data, detections, and stimulations that were recorded by our RNS System, and can program new detection and stimulation settings that are personalized to each patient’s brain activity. While the patient is in clinic, the clinician can look at real time iEEG data or test stimulation settings.


Our Patient Data Management System is a secure online database that collects data that have been recorded in our RNS System. These data, which include all programmed parameters, detections, stimulations, and stored iEEG activity for RNS System patients, can be accessed through our Physician Tablet or from any internet browser. The clinician may choose to view recent data or to look at longer term trends in order to assess the effects of RNS System treatment, antiepileptic drugs or even changes to the patient’s routine. This information, combined with the patient’s own reports, is used by the clinicians to make treatment decisions.

In addition to the extensive dataset available on our Patient Data Management System, our nSight Platform is designed to provide clinicians with personalized patient reports. Our nSight Platform includes objective iEEG data recorded by our RNS System, patient-reported seizure diary data, and prior programmed settings, which are available in a simple and comprehensive report that provides the clinician actionable information about their patient’s seizure trends and treatment outcomes. This quick snapshot gives clinicians a more complete picture of their patient’s health and enables them to remotely manage certain portions of the patient’s care in a telehealth environment.
As we collect iEEG data from our RNS System, our database of iEEG records continues to grow. As of December 31, 2022, over 4,000 epilepsy patients have received our RNS System, yielding an extensive database of over twelve million iEEG records. We believe that we are able to continue to learn and innovate by leveraging this database and our data analytics capabilities, thereby improving and enhancing our products and creating actionable insights for clinicians that improve clinical outcomes for patients.

RNS System – Patient and Clinician Experience
Once an adult patient has been through the diagnostic process in a Level 4 CEC and has been determined to have drug-resistant focal epilepsy, we believe the patient should be considered for our RNS System if the patient has one to two identified seizure foci and is not among the approximately 20% of drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients who may be ideal candidates for surgery. Our RNS System is initially implanted by a neurosurgeon in an inpatient procedure at a Level 4 CEC. Detection is turned on at the end of the implant procedure when the neurostimulator is placed. The patient typically remains in the hospital overnight, then returns home and resumes normal activities. Prior to the first in-person follow up visit, which typically occurs approximately two weeks to four weeks after the implant procedure, an epileptologist will review the iEEG data recorded by our RNS System and identify patient specific patterns that are associated with the early onset of seizures. During the follow-up visit, the epileptologist 
will make programming adjustments to the device’s detection parameters in order to optimize for early detection. Once the patient-specific detection parameters are established, the epileptologist will turn on the stimulation feature, activating the closed-loop treatment of our RNS System.
Once the device has been programmed, our RNS System integrates seamlessly into the typical cadence of care that clinicians currently utilize to manage epilepsy patients. Patients visit their clinician on average every three months during the first year after the procedure. During these visits, clinicians review the iEEG data and may fine-tune programming of the device to optimize clinical outcomes. Once the device settings have been sufficiently fine-tuned, patients typically visit their clinician every three to six months, or on an as needed basis. At any point, clinicians can remotely review patient data and connect with the patient on next steps. 
Additionally, we believe that patients find that seeing and learning about their own brain data is empowering and engaging. We believe that for the first time, clinicians can show patients their own seizure patterns and seizure cycles recorded by our RNS System, so that patients can directly see the effects on brain activity with changes in activity or treatment. Patients also appreciate that the device is not visible to themselves or others. 
Our RNS System has an average battery life of nearly eleven years, an increase from the previous model of the device. The device requires replacement once it approaches the end of its battery life. Prior to 2018, the commercial model of our RNS System had an average battery life of approximately four years. We believe that patients prefer a longer battery life as it reduces the number of procedures they will require over their lifetime. Replacement procedures are typically performed on an outpatient basis and take approximately one hour. Clinicians are able to view the device’s battery status through our Patient Data Management System or on our Physician Tablet, and can plan accordingly with the patient for replacement procedures. In 2019, more than 90% of patients whose RNS System reached the end of its battery life chose to have a replacement RNS System implanted. 
Key Clinical Advantages of our RNS System
We believe the key advantages of our RNS System relative to both alternative neuromodulation devices and resective or ablative surgery include:
Significant and improving seizure reduction in all areas of the brain. Four multi-center FDA approved prospective clinical trials and multiple retrospective studies have demonstrated that our RNS System provides significant, sustained and improving reductions in disabling seizures. In our Pivotal Study, patients experienced a median reduction in seizure frequency of 44% after the first year. The patients from the Pivotal Study, all of whom received implants prior to 2010, were followed in a LTT in which outcomes reached a 75% median reduction in seizure frequency at nine years. 28% of these patients, who had previously experienced disabling seizures for an average of 20 years, had at least 6 months of seizure freedom and approximately 20% achieved one year or more of seizure freedom. Additionally, we believe the insights obtained from our extensive brain data set are driving improvements in overall therapy effectiveness across patient cohorts over time. The real-world results published in 2020 from a retrospective study across eight epilepsy centers with patients implanted between 2013 and 2018 showed a statistically significant median seizure frequency reduction of 67% at one year (p<0.05). This is consistent with the interim one year results of our ongoing prospective Post-Approval Study, increasing to 82% by year three, which we believe is the highest published seizure frequency reduction for any neuromodulation study in adults with focal onset seizures. Importantly, peer-reviewed studies have also indicated that our RNS System demonstrates similar efficacy outcomes regardless of the region of the brain being treated, whether there are one or two seizure foci, and whether the patient has been treated with VNS or resective or ablative surgery. 
Lack of stimulation-related side effects. Our clinical studies have collectively demonstrated that RNS System therapy is well-tolerated. Patients do not perceive the therapeutic stimulation, which is delivered only to the area of abnormal activity, and only when that abnormal activity occurs. Unlike other neuromodulation devices for epilepsy, which provide hours of stimulation each day to non-specific targets and have been shown to negatively impact sleep, mood, memory, or vocal characteristics, our RNS System stimulates the precise seizure targets and only when needed, resulting in a highly effective therapy with approximately three minutes of stimulation on average per day in total. 
Quality of life, cognition, and mood improvement. Reduced quality of life and cognitive function, as well as mental health-related comorbidities, are a significant burden for many patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Improvements in these areas are critically important clinical outcomes for patients. In our Pivotal Study, at one and two years of follow-up, patients who began treatment less than ten years after epilepsy onset achieved statistically significant improvements in overall quality of life scores as well as in every subdomain of quality of life, including cognitive function, mental health, and physical health. Additionally, our clinical studies have demonstrated that treatment with our RNS System resulted in lasting improvements in overall quality of life, including cognitive function, sustained through nine years. Based on comprehensive neuropsychological assessments, there were no adverse cognitive effects and, in fact, significant cognitive improvements were demonstrated in areas such as naming, verbal learning, visual memory, and executive function.
Low risk, reversible procedure. As demonstrated by multiple clinical studies, our RNS System has a favorable safety profile relative to surgical procedures for epilepsy and a comparable risk profile to the implantation of other neuromodulation devices. Resective or ablative surgical procedures carry a risk of permanent damage to neurological and cognitive function, whereas the non-destructive RNS System implant procedure has not demonstrated a negative impact on neurological or cognitive function. Additionally, stimulation treatment with our RNS System is reversible and modifiable, and does not take away the option of a surgery in the future.
Reduction in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Epilepsy patients, particularly those with uncontrolled epilepsy, face a risk of sudden and unexpected death as a result of their condition. Each year, about 1 in 150 patients with uncontrolled epilepsy will die from SUDEP. According to clinical studies, the SUDEP rate is approximately 6.1 per 1,000 patient years in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and 9.3 per 1,000 patient years in patients referred for resective or ablative surgery. By contrast, data from a published series of 707 patients across our clinical studies and post-market experience indicated that our RNS System was associated with a lower rate of dying from SUDEP of 2.0 per 1,000 patient years relative to other treatment-resistant epilepsy groups. 
The results of our prospective clinical studies, which are the largest and longest published studies in the field of neuromodulation for epilepsy, as well as the data that has been published in multiple retrospective studies of our RNS System, provide evidence that our RNS System is a safe and effective treatment for focal onset seizures and offers a lower risk profile than that of resective or ablative surgery. In addition, we believe our RNS System is 
superior in tolerability and efficacy to other neuromodulation approaches. We anticipate that the accruing evidence base from our ongoing Post-Approval Study and commercial experience with our RNS System will continue to demonstrate strong and improving clinical outcomes over time, which will support continued adoption.
Benefits to Other Stakeholders
In addition to offering important clinical benefits to patients, we believe our RNS System offers important distinctions for providers and payors. 
Providers
We believe the unprecedented insights into brain activity that are enabled by our RNS System’s differentiated ability to record iEEG data offer clinicians the opportunity to more thoroughly understand patient specific brain activity in order to optimize treatment for their patients. With the benefit of objective, long-term data on seizure trends and treatment response, clinicians are better able to actively manage patient care and support improved outcomes over time. In a survey of 50 epileptologists and neurosurgeons at Level 3 and Level 4 epilepsy centers, 88% agreed that having 24/7 monitoring with chronic high-resolution intracranial EEG data is an important consideration and advantage in choosing RNS versus VNS or DBS.
Importantly, in addition to the availability of established clinician and facility reimbursement for the initial and replacement implant procedures, the patient’s managing clinician can seek reimbursement for in-person or remote iEEG data review up to once per month and for device programming. Because our RNS System is the only neuromodulation device that records iEEG data, we believe it is also the only neuromodulation device with established reimbursement for data review by clinicians during and between in-person clinic visits, which we believe is an important element of optimizing patient care.
Payors
Drug-resistant epilepsy is a costly condition that places a significant economic burden on healthcare systems as well as on patients and their families. The estimated direct costs of epilepsy alone are approximately $28 billion annually in the United States and are disproportionately accrued by individuals with uncontrolled drug-resistant epilepsy. By offering drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients a safe, effective treatment alternative that significantly reduces ongoing seizure frequency without stimulation-related side effects at therapeutic settings, we believe our RNS System has the potential to reduce the cost burden associated with drug-resistant epilepsy. We believe the established and favorable reimbursement paradigm for our RNS System, which covers both the implantation procedure and ongoing patient treatment provided by clinicians, endorses the value proposition that it offers payors. 
We also believe that the unique ability for clinicians to review their patients’ RNS System data online can facilitate telehealth delivery, potentially reducing the overall cost of care, while improving the patient experience. For example, many patients who might otherwise schedule a clinic visit because of a concern about seizures can now contact their clinician from their home, who can then review their RNS System data online and provide care remotely. 
Clinical Data 
The safety, effectiveness. and clinical benefits of our RNS System are supported by data from four multi-center, FDA approved prospective clinical studies representing nearly 600 patients and multiple retrospective studies reporting real-world outcomes. Our robust and growing body of clinical evidence, which includes nine-year follow-up with over 2,500 years of patient data, provides the largest and longest published prospective clinical data set in the field of neuromodulation devices for epilepsy. Data from these studies collectively demonstrate that our RNS System provides significant, sustained, and improving reductions in disabling seizures with enduring improvements in quality of life and cognition for patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. 
Our first prospective clinical trial, the Feasibility Study, was initiated to assess the safety and performance of our RNS System and to provide preliminary evidence of effectiveness for patients living with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Data from the two-year Feasibility Study supported IDE approval for our two-year Pivotal Study, a double 
blinded randomized, sham-stimulation controlled multi-center study that was initiated in 2005 and provided Class I evidence of the safety and effectiveness of our RNS System. Data from the Pivotal Study supported FDA PMA approval of our RNS System. Patients from the Feasibility and Pivotal Studies were subsequently enrolled in our LTT study that followed these patients for an additional seven years, culminating in a total of nine years of follow-up data. We are currently conducting a prospective Post-Approval Study evaluating “real world” outcomes across more than 300 additional patients. We are also pursuing studies to support label expansion for our RNS System in additional epilepsy populations. 
Across the 256 patients that were enrolled in the Feasibility and Pivotal studies, the average age was 34 years old and the patients had experienced an average of 10.2 disabling seizures per month for an average of 19.6 years. All patients had previously tried multiple AEDs, 32% of patients had previously been treated with VNS, and 34% had previously undergone resective or ablative surgery. 
Feasibility Study
The Feasibility Study was a two-year prospective, primarily open-label study of our RNS System in adult drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients that demonstrated safety and provided sufficient evidence of effectiveness to support the commencement of a pivotal study. Beginning in 2004, 65 patients were treated with our RNS System and 59 patients completed the study. 
The primary safety endpoints were the rate of serious adverse events during the first month post-implant and the first three months post-implant. The serious adverse events rates at one month post-implant and three months post-implant of 6.2% and 9.2%, respectively, were not worse than the serious adverse event rates associated with the implantation of intracranial electrodes for localization procedures and epilepsy surgery at one month post-implant of 19%, or the historical adverse event rate for DBS for treatment of movement disorders at three months post-implant of 36%. During this two-year study, 53 serious adverse events, or SAEs, were reported, 18 of which were either associated with the RNS System or were inconclusive as to association with the RNS System. These SAEs included increased seizure frequency, wound erosion, confusion, death (one instance for which we were unable to conclude whether there was association with the RNS System), depression, headaches, or the requirement for explant surgery to remove the RNS System.
This safety experience combined with encouraging data on seizure outcomes supported commencement of the subsequent Pivotal Study.
Pivotal Study
The Pivotal Study was a two-year prospective, double-blinded, randomized, and sham-stimulation controlled study that provided Class I evidence indicating that our RNS System is safe and effective as an adjunctive treatment for adults with drug-resistant focal epilepsy arising from one or two seizure foci. Between December 2005 and November 2008, 191 patients were enrolled in the study and 175 of those patients completed the study. 
The primary effectiveness endpoint was assessed by comparing seizure reduction in the group receiving active stimulation (treatment group) relative to the group receiving no stimulation (sham group) during a 12-week blinded evaluation period relative to a 12-week pre-implant baseline. The primary effectiveness endpoint was met with a statistically significant difference between the reduction in seizure frequency for the treatment group relative to the sham group. In the final month of the blinded evaluation period (five months post-implant), patients in the treatment group reached a 41.5% reduction in seizures, compared to a 9.4% reduction for patients in the sham stimulation group.
The primary safety endpoint was also met, demonstrating that the serious adverse event rate at one month was not worse than the literature-derived serious adverse event rates for resective or ablative surgery, implantation of intracranial electrodes for seizure localization, and DBS for treatment of movement disorders. 
Stimulation was also well-tolerated. There was no difference in stimulation-related side effects between active and sham patients in the blinded period and no adverse effects of responsive stimulation on cognitive function or mood. In fact, there were statistically significant improvements in a number of areas of cognitive function, including 
executive function, language, and memory. Memory improvements were most evident in patients with seizure onsets in memory regions and verbal fluency improvements were most significant in those with seizure onsets in language areas. Patients also experienced modest improvements in mood and a decrease in seizure worry at two years of treatment. During this two-year study 220 SAEs were reported, 67 of which were either associated with the RNS System or were inconclusive as to association with the RNS System. These SAEs included procedural complications (such as device lead revision or damage, skin laceration, subdural hematoma, premature battery depletion, or implant site erosion), nervous system disorders (such as an increase in complex partial seizures, exacerbation or increase in tonic-clonic seizures, or hydrocephalus), implant site infections, death (seven instances with one for which we were unable to conclude whether there was association with the RNS System), pain, and discharge.
Patients were also assessed for changes in Quality of Life, or QOL, as measured by a comprehensive industry-recognized questionnaire that is validated and widely used for patients living with epilepsy. As shown in the graph below, there were statistically significant sustained improvements in overall QOL as well as in every subdomain of QOL for patients who began treatment less than ten years after epilepsy onset at both one and two years of follow-up. 
Long-Term Treatment Study
The LTT study was a seven-year prospective, open-label study that followed patients originally treated in either the Feasibility or Pivotal Study. In total, this provided approximately nine years of prospective data on the safety and efficacy of our RNS System. The LTT study, which enrolled 230 patients, is the largest and longest prospective trial published in the field of neuromodulation to date and provided additional evidence that our RNS System is safe, reduces seizure frequency, and improves QOL in adults with drug-resistant focal epilepsy with one or two seizure foci. Enrolled patients were studied over a median follow-up of 8.97 years, representing 1,895 cumulative patient-implant years. 
The primary effectiveness objective of the LTT study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of our RNS System in reducing the frequency of disabling seizures in patients who participated in the Feasibility Study or Pivotal Study. As indicated in the figure below, the median percent reduction in seizure frequency improved from 44% after one year to 75% at nine years. We believe the substantial improvement in seizure reduction that was observed over time 
is due, in part, to the brain-responsive nature of our RNS System and the personalized, data-driven, and iterative therapy that it enables.
Additionally, at nine years, 35% of patients had a greater than 90% reduction in seizure frequency, with some of those patients being seizure-free for years, and 28% had at least one seizure-free period of six months or longer. These improvements were particularly notable given that at baseline the patients in this trial had on average more than 10 disabling seizures a month, with an average of nearly 20 years of epilepsy, and had failed multiple other epilepsy therapies. Overall QOL as well as the sub-domains of the comprehensive QOL score remained significantly improved relative to baseline at each year of treatment. 
During this seven-year study 576 SAEs were reported, 93 of which were either associated with the RNS System or were inconclusive as to association with the RNS System. These SAEs included procedural complications (such as device lead revision or damage, skin laceration, fractures from falls, premature battery depletion, wound dehiscence, or implant site erosion), nervous system disorders (such as an increase in complex partial seizures, exacerbation or increase in tonic-clonic seizures, or headaches), implant site infections, device removal, death (nine instances with two for which we were unable to conclude whether there was association with the RNS System).
Post-Approval Study 
We have completed enrollment for an FDA-mandated prospective open-label “real-world” study of our RNS System in drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients with a planned follow up period of five years. In this clinical study, our RNS System was implanted in 324 patients across 32 centers. The objectives of the clinical study are to collect additional information on the safety and effectiveness of our RNS System and to analyze patient outcomes and responses according to center experience and stimulation parameters. An interim analysis of 160 patients followed for one year that was presented at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting in 2019 showed a 67% median reduction in seizure frequency compared to baseline, demonstrating significantly better outcomes than were seen in our Feasibility Study and Pivotal Study at that same time point. In addition, 38.5% of patients followed for more than one year experienced a greater than 90% reduction in seizure frequency. 
During this five-year study, 112 SAEs were reported, 21 of which were either associated with the RNS System or were inconclusive as to association with the RNS System. These SAEs included nervous system disorders (such as cerebral or intracranial hemorrhage and nerve paralysis), implant site infections, subdural hematoma, psychogenic seizure, and implant site erosion.
Publications and Retrospective Studies
Overall, there are more than 300 publications that provide information related to our RNS System. In addition to reviews and expert opinions on patient selection for RNS System treatment, these publications include studies of treatment outcomes in general and by specific brain regions or causes of epilepsy. Certain of these publications 
review surgical techniques and safety, as well as strategies for the implant location of the RNS neurostimulator and leads. 
Another subset of these publications describes how the long-term iEEG data uniquely provided by our RNS System can offer significant benefits in managing epilepsy patients and driving fundamental research on epilepsy. These publications describe how long-term iEEG data can be used to identify seizure triggers, distinguish epileptic from non-epileptic seizures, inform surgical resection, or provide an early assessment of AED response. Recent analyses of RNS System data describe cycles in seizure activity that were not previously recognized, and propose that these data could assist in forecasting times when patients are at greater risk for seizures. 
In addition, a number of these publications are retrospective studies of the “real-world” efficacy and utility of our RNS System, some of which have been supported, in part, by us. The largest of these published retrospective studies was a retrospective chart review of 150 patients across eight epilepsy centers who were treated with our RNS System according to the approved indication for use. This study, which was published in July 2020 in Epilepsia, documented median reductions in seizure frequency over three years post-treatment that exceeded those from our Pivotal Study. The median reduction in seizure frequency at one year was 67% (149 patient sample size), which is consistent with the one-year interim results of our Post-Approval Study, and increased to 75% at two years (93 patient sample size) and 82% at three years (38 patient sample size). In addition, 35% of patients had a greater than or equal to 90% seizure frequency reduction at their last follow up visit. We believe the improvement in seizure frequency outcomes between our Pivotal Study and both our Post-Approval Study and this retrospective study demonstrates the utility that our growing body of brain data is providing to drive better and faster seizure reduction outcomes.
Current Studies 
We are conducting studies to support label expansion for our RNS System in additional epilepsy populations. We have IDE approval for an open label study of our RNS System in adolescent patients between ages 12 and 17 who have drug-resistant focal epilepsy from one or two foci. The objective of this study is to demonstrate safety and effectiveness in this patient population, and to obtain data on quality of life, neuropsychological function, and social function. Importantly, our RNS System does not require any modifications to conduct this study. We began enrollment in this study in late 2021.
Supported by evidence published in peer-reviewed journals, we also believe that our current RNS System may be able to effectively treat patients with drug-resistant generalized epilepsy. In February 2021, our RNS System received Breakthrough Device Designation from the FDA for the treatment of IGE. In the second half of 2021, we received IDE approval to initiate a study in IGE and have begun enrollment.
Commercial Strategy 
We designed our commercial strategy to primarily target epileptologists and neurosurgeons at Level 4 CECs in the United States. Within Level 4 CECs, epileptologists are the primary specialists who prescribe and manage therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients and neurosurgeons are the specialists who implant our RNS System. As of April 1, 2019, we estimate that there are approximately 1,200 epileptologists and 400 neurosurgeons associated with the approximately 200 Level 4 CECs in the United States. We also improve flow of appropriate patients to Level 4 CECs with sales and marketing initiatives designed to enhance awareness of our RNS System and increase referrals of drug-resistant epilepsy patients to these centers. We believe that with modest additional resources, our commercial organization will have sufficient capacity to establish relationships with the remaining Level 4 CECs in the United States that are not yet using our RNS System and drive increased penetration in new and existing accounts.
We market and sell our RNS System in the United States through a direct sales organization that consists of sales representatives, known as Therapy Consultants, and clinical and programming support specialists, known as Field Clinical Engineers. Our Therapy Consultants are highly skilled and technically trained with substantial experience launching new disruptive therapies, particularly in neuromodulation, and establishing them as a standard of care by increasing clinician adoption and utilization. Our Field Clinical Engineers have substantial experience training clinicians on the use of sophisticated technology and providing ongoing support for medical 
centers as they increase adoption of new therapies. We do not currently sell our product in markets outside the United States.
Our Therapy Consultants are responsible for developing territory business plans, targeting and onboarding new accounts, and increasing adoption of our RNS System within accounts. In addition, Therapy Consultants support epileptologists and their staff in incorporating our RNS System into their practice, and provide resources to help with patient education, as well as working to expand our referral pathways to increase referrals into Level 4 CECs. Together with our Field Clinical Engineers, they provide information that epileptologists can use to inform the development of appropriate patient selection protocols, and partner with the epilepsy care team to help incorporate our RNS System into their workflow. Our Field Clinical Engineers are responsible for ongoing account management including training clinicians on the use of our RNS System, promoting its benefits within existing accounts, and driving increased clinician utilization.
We support our sales organization with marketing and training initiatives designed to educate clinicians about our RNS System and support clinician adoption at CECs. We have developed a robust professional education program that includes educational symposia, fellows training, programming workshops, and peer-to-peer forums. Through webinars, clinical briefs, and scientific conferences, we keep our clinician customers informed about the rapidly growing body of peer-reviewed publications and scientific research involving our RNS System.
Our sales and marketing programs are also designed to increase referrals of drug-resistant epilepsy patients to Level 4 CECs. We estimate that only one in five drug-resistant epilepsy patients receive specialized care at a comprehensive epilepsy center. To drive increased patient flow to Level 4 CECs, we are beginning to scale our market development initiatives to engage epilepsy patients and caregivers through our advocacy partnerships and marketing programs. These programs include digital and social media campaigns, advertising, public relations, patient webinars, community outreach, support groups, and patient ambassador programs. In addition, we plan to increase awareness of our RNS System amongst clinicians who care for epilepsy patients early in their care, including general neurologists and epileptologists who practice outside of Level 4 CECs, through education and outreach designed to expand our referral pathways to drive patient referrals to Level 4 CECs. As we grow awareness and utilization of our RNS System, we plan to continue to enhance our marketing and analytics capabilities to support our growing customer base.
Research and Development 
We focus our research and development efforts on advancing the treatment of patients living with disabling neurological disorders. These efforts are enhanced by the strong relationships that we have developed with epileptologists and neurosurgeons, as well as other neuroscientists and experts, through our clinical and commercial activities. We believe our brain-responsive RNS System is a platform that can drive a better standard of care for patients living with drug-resistant epilepsy, and can also offer a more personalized solution and improved outcomes to the large population of patients living with other brain disorders.
Our research and development activities encompass basic research, clinical research and product development. Our research and development team has mechanical, biomedical and electrical engineering, software development, project management, data science, and machine and deep learning expertise. In addition, our clinical organization has expertise as well as extensive experience in clinical trial design and management, data collection, data management, and clinical data analysis. Our clinical team has conducted three prospective clinical studies on our RNS System and completed enrollment in a fourth, prospective Post-Approval Study. We believe the strength and strategic vision of our research and development team, combined with our clinical and regulatory expertise, will continue to drive our leadership position in the emerging category of brain-responsive neuromodulation.
Our near-term research and development efforts are focused on continuing to improve therapy effectiveness, enhancing the patient and provider experience, and expanding the population of patients that can be treated with our RNS System. Our research and development activities have resulted in significant new releases of components of the RNS System that advanced these goals. Our near-term development pipeline includes enhancements that leverage our extensive database of iEEG data and our advanced data analysis and AI capabilities, which provide clinicians with additional information that they can use to enhance their clinical assessment and establish appropriate 
program settings for each patient. In addition to our near-term efforts, we continue to focus on developing our next-generation neurostimulator and developing new features such as streamlined, remote programming capabilities. 
We also maintain and will continue to build an intellectual property portfolio covering brain responsive neuromodulation and AI assessment of brain data. In the future, we intend to leverage these assets to expand into other brain disorders that we believe could benefit from the physiologic and engineering advantages made possible by our brain-responsive neuromodulation solution.
Coverage and Reimbursement 
We derive substantially all of our revenue from sales of our RNS System, including both initial and replacement devices, to the hospital facilities, which are typically Level 4 CECs, that implant our RNS System in the United States. These facilities, in turn, bill third party payors, including private insurers, Medicare or Medicaid on a per procedure basis including for the implant procedure and post-implant programming and iEEG data review.
Given the relatively young average age of our patient population, many of our patients do not qualify for Medicare. As such, the third party payor mix for patients implanted with our RNS System has historically been more heavily weighted toward private insurers. As of December 31, 2022, commercial insurance companies that address over 200 million covered lives in the United States have positive written coverage policies for responsive neuromodulation for drug-resistant focal epilepsy, which includes our RNS System. Medicare and Medicaid also routinely provide coverage for implantation of our RNS System and follow-up care. Based on our experience, less than 1% of potential RNS System patients have been unable to undergo an implant procedure with our RNS System due to lack of payor coverage.
Initial implantation of our RNS System takes place in a single hospital inpatient procedure. Hospitals are generally reimbursed for inpatient procedures based on Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group, or MS‐DRG, classifications derived from ICD-10 codes that describe the patient’s diagnoses and procedure(s) performed during the hospital stay. One single MS‐DRG payment is intended to cover all hospital costs associated with treating an individual during his or her hospital stay, with the exception of clinician charges associated with performing medical procedures, which are reimbursed through CPT codes and payments. While these MS-DRG and CPT codes are generally employed by both private insurers and government payors, the payment rates typically differ substantially, with private insurers generally providing reimbursement at higher rates than Medicare or Medicaid.
Hospitals code for implantation of our RNS System neurostimulator and implantation of the leads using separate ICD-10 procedure codes. When combined with an ICD-10 diagnosis code for epilepsy, the codes map into MS-DRG 023 for payment to the hospital. In federal fiscal year 2023, which runs from October 2022 through September 2023, we expect the Medicare average payment rate for MS-DRG 023 at our Level 4 CEC accounts to be approximately $54,000. We believe that most DBS procedures for epilepsy map into MS-DRG 024 and we expect the Medicare average payment rate at Level 4 CECs for this code will be approximately $37,600. 
The neurosurgeons who implant our RNS System may seek reimbursement for their services using a variety of Category I CPT codes, depending on the type of leads implanted. These codes include CPT code 61886 for implantation of a two lead system in addition to CPT codes 61850 or 61860 for cortical leads or CPT codes 61863 and 61864 for depth leads. We believe these codes for depth leads are the same CPT codes used for reimbursement of physician services for epilepsy DBS procedures. Based on 2023 Medicare national average payment rates, we expect that physician reimbursement under appropriate combinations of these codes may be between approximately $2,500 to $2,730 per procedure for our RNS System and approximately $2,730 for epilepsy DBS procedures. We believe physician services for the VNS implantation procedure are reimbursed under CPT code 64568 which is associated with a 2023 Medicare national average payment rate of approximately $610.
When the battery in our RNS neurostimulator reaches end of service the neurostimulator is typically replaced in a hospital outpatient procedure. Reimbursement for the facility in the outpatient setting is determined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’, or CMS’, comprehensive Ambulatory Payment Classification, or APC, system which assigns codes specifically related to a single procedure. Hospitals receive outpatient reimbursement based on the APC group assigned to the physician service or procedure performed, which are described by CPT codes. Our RNS System replacement procedure is coded with a Category I CPT code, which maps into APC-5465 for payment 
to the hospital, and we believe this is the same code used for the initial implant procedure for VNS. In 2023, we expect the Medicare average payment rate for APC-5465 at our Level 4 CEC accounts to be approximately $30,800. The neurosurgeon is also reimbursed for services related to the replacement procedure based on the CPT code reported. 
After implantation of our RNS System, the patient’s ongoing care, including device programming and data review, is typically managed by an epileptologist or other qualified clinician. The patient’s managing physician is able to seek reimbursement for programming on an as needed basis. The physician can also seek reimbursement a maximum of once every 30 days for in-person or remote review of iEEGs, which are also referred to as electrocorticograms, or ECoGs. The codes utilized for device programming for both RNS and DBS are CPT codes 95983 and 95984 and the code for ECoG review is CPT code 95836. We believe this CPT code for ECoG review is only applicable to our RNS System as it is currently the only commercially available implanted brain neuromodulation system that records, stores, and enables online review of the patient’s ECoG data. 
Based on 2023 Medicare national average payment rates, reimbursement under CPT codes 95983 and 95984 is expected to range from $50 to $94, depending on length of programming time. Reimbursement under CPT code 95836 is expected to be approximately $106 for ECoG review. Accordingly, physician reimbursement for device programming and ECoG review during a typical RNS System follow-up visit could range from $156 to $200. We believe physicians submit claims for VNS device programming using code 95976 or 95977, depending on the number of device parameters changed. Based on Medicare national average payment rates, payment under these codes is expected to range from $40 to $53. 
Competition 
Our industry is competitive and has been evolving rapidly with the introduction of new products and technologies as well as the market activities of industry participants. Our RNS System is indicated for adult patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy and we currently market our device primarily to the clinicians within Level 4 CECs that treat these patients. In this patient population, there are two primary treatment options: (i) an ablative or resective surgery, or (ii) implantation of a neuromodulation device. Patients may also choose not to actively seek additional treatment for epilepsy or may choose to trial new therapeutic drugs that become available from time to time. However, none of the AEDs that have been approved in the last decade have been demonstrated to show additional sustained effectiveness beyond that of the established AEDs. 
We estimate that approximately 80% of drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients are either not ideal candidates for ablative or resective surgery or are unwilling to undergo a destructive surgical procedure and we compete primarily with two manufacturers of neuromodulation devices for the treatment of these patients. Our competitors are LivaNova plc, which manufactures the VNS System and Medtronic plc, which manufactures the DBS System. These competitors are larger, well-capitalized companies with significant resources, which may include:
•established sales and marketing programs and networks, including internationally;
•broad product portfolios;
•long operating histories;
•established relationships with healthcare professionals;
•established manufacturing scale and supplier networks;
•financial resources for product development; and 
•name recognition. 
In addition to competing for market share, we also compete against these companies for qualified personnel.
We believe that our RNS System is a paradigm-shifting approach to treating drug-resistant focal epilepsy. By continuously monitoring the brain’s electrical activity, recognizing and responding to patient-specific seizure onset 
patterns, and recording ongoing iEEG data that clinicians can use to optimize patient care, we believe our RNS System addresses the primary unmet needs in epilepsy care today. We compete primarily on the basis that our system is designed to offer superior tolerability and efficacy to other neuromodulation approaches, as well as access to continuous brain data. Our continued success depends on our ability to:
•continue to demonstrate safety and efficacy in our Post-Approval Study and in ongoing commercial use;
•expand our footprint of Level 4 CECs implanting our RNS System and increase utilization in new and existing CECs;
•increase the number of epileptologists recommending and the number of neurosurgeons implanting our RNS System; 
•drive awareness to increase the number of drug-resistant epilepsy patients referred to Level 4 CECs by expanding our referral pathways;
•maintain adequate reimbursement for procedures using our product;
•attract and retain skilled research, development, sales and clinical personnel;
•continue to innovate in order to improve therapy effectiveness and enhance the patient and provider experience;
•obtain and maintain regulatory clearances and approvals, including for expanded indications;
•cost-effectively manufacture, market and sell our product; and
•obtain, maintain, enforce and defend our intellectual property rights and operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our RNS System and any future products, to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights, to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, and to operate without infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. We actively seek to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business, which includes patents covering the components of our RNS System and the methods used for optimizing the therapy that our RNS System delivers. We also seek patent protection for other processes and inventions that are commercially or strategically important to developing and maximizing the value of our enterprise. We take steps to build and maintain the integrity of our brand, for example, with trademarks and service marks, and we seek to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. We rely on a strategy that combines the use of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and license agreements, as well as other intellectual property laws, employment, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights.
Patents
Patent Portfolio
Our patents and patent applications assert claims generally related to devices, methods and systems. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 122 issued U.S. patents and 20 non-provisional patent applications pending in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO. Our patents have claims that cover our current RNS System or related products, such as the system itself and methods of using it, as well as the brain leads, lead connector, neurostimulator tray or ferrule, and elements used in the manufacture of the same. Additionally, we have pending applications with claims directed to: detecting anomalous brain activity and the source thereof; modulating brain activity - such as with electrical stimulation - to treat disorders and diseases of the nervous system; efficient 
communication or data transfer between implantable and external components of a neuromodulation system; the use of data to optimize therapy outcomes, such as by using artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques; and various combinations thereof. We also own several issued foreign patents, including in Canada, Australia, the U.K., and Germany directed to systems and methods for modulating brain activity. We continue to evaluate our intellectual property portfolio as patents reach end of life to determine the optimal course for continuing to protect our technology.
We cannot ensure that patents will issue from any of our pending applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology.
Patent Strategy
Our patent strategy is to seek patent protection for our inventions and to preserve our options to file additional applications pursuing claims covering specific commercial embodiments of the inventions, assuming these are strategically valuable. We also file patent applications covering innovations and developments to prevent third parties from developing competing products. Additionally, where appropriate, we file patent applications covering inventions related to new technologies or novel applications of our products and processes in areas beyond the scope of where we are focusing our resources in the near term, in order to preserve optionality as our business grows and to prevent third parties from expanding their reach. From time to time, we may also in-license or out-license patents in accordance with our patent strategy. For all patent applications, we determine claiming strategy on a case-by-case basis. Advice of counsel, as well as our business model and needs are also considered.
We recognize that the ability to obtain patent protection and the degree of such protection depends on a number of factors. The patent positions of medical device companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific, and factual questions. The protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of patent term adjustments and extensions, the availability of legal remedies, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly narrowed before the patent is issued, and patent claims can be reinterpreted or further altered even after patent issuance. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors. A competitor could develop systems, devices, or methods of manufacture or treatment that are not covered by our patents. Accordingly, our ability to stop third parties from commercializing any of our patented inventions, either directly or indirectly, will depend in part on our success in obtaining, maintaining, defending, and enforcing patent claims that adequately cover our inventions. 
Our commercial success will also depend, in part, on not infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of third parties. Third parties own numerous patents in the U.S. and in jurisdictions outside the U.S. with claims directed to inventions in the fields in which we operate or plan to operate. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, seek licenses, cease certain activities, or participate in USPTO proceedings. Moreover, such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license necessary to our business may have a material adverse impact on us.
On July 27, 2005, we entered into a cross-license agreement, or the Cross-License, with Medtronic, Inc., or Medtronic, directed to patent families in a field of use that is generally aligned with our business interests, including direct electrical stimulation or monitoring of the brain via electrodes attached to or implanted in the head for the treatment or diagnosis of epilepsy and other disorders, or the Field. Under the terms of the Cross-License, Medtronic granted to us a royalty-bearing, worldwide, non-exclusive, license in the Field to certain patent families owned or controlled by Medtronic or acquired by or licensed to Medtronic. In turn, we granted to Medtronic a royalty-bearing, worldwide, non-exclusive license in the Field to certain patents owned or controlled by us or acquired by or licensed to us. The term of the Cross-License extends through the life of the licensed patents, unless it is extended by the parties or otherwise terminated early pursuant to its terms. The Cross-License provides that each party may 
terminate the Cross-License if the other party materially breaches the Cross-License and does not cure the breach within a specified period of time.
Trademarks
Our trademark portfolio is designed to protect the brands of our RNS System and any future products. As of December 31, 2022, we own 26 trademark registrations, four of which are U.S. trademark registrations and the rest in various other countries or regions. We own trademark registrations for “NeuroPace,” the “NeuroPace” logo, and “RNS” in the United States and various other countries, and “WINDOW TO THE BRAIN” in the U.S.
Trade Secrets
We also rely on trade secrets relating to our product and technology, and we maintain the confidentiality of such proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We seek to protect our trade secrets and know-how by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees, contractors, consultants, suppliers, customers, and other third parties, who have access to such information. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us are to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. 
For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Manufacturing and Supply 
We currently manufacture our RNS System at and distribute all of the components of our RNS System from our approximately 53,000 square foot facility in Mountain View, California. This facility provides approximately 20,000 square feet of space for our production and distribution operations, including manufacturing, quality control and storage. We believe our existing facility will be sufficient to meet our current and near-term manufacturing needs. 
Our manufacturing and distribution operations are subject to regulatory requirements of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, for medical devices sold in the United States. The FDA monitors compliance with the QSR through periodic inspections of our facilities and may include our suppliers’ facilities as well. We are also subject to applicable state and local regulations relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal, sale, labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and remediation of hazardous substances. 
Our failure, or the failure of our suppliers, to maintain acceptable quality requirements could result in substantial fines, the shutdown of our manufacturing operations or the recall of our components of our RNS System, which would harm our business. In the event that one of our suppliers fails to maintain acceptable quality requirements, we may have to find and qualify a new supplier and could experience a material adverse effect to our manufacturing operations and result in manufacturing delays. 
We believe our quality management system is compliant with FDA Quality Systems Regulations. We have been an FDA registered medical device establishment since 2014 and California licensed medical device manufacturer since 2004. We moved to our current Mountain View, California facility in March 2012. 
The FDA conducted a PMA pre-approval inspection of our manufacturing facility in Mountain View, California prior to our PMA approval, as well as an establishment inspection in September 2014 which resulted in no 483 observations. We were accepted into the FDA Voluntary Improvement Program in 2018 and we are in our fifth year of participation in the program. The FDA Voluntary Improvement Program is part of the FDA’s Case for Quality Program. As a participant in this program, we have an on-site appraisal once a year during which an appraisal team assesses our processes to determine areas for improvement, and we have subsequent quarterly check-in assessments that are designed to discuss our progress in continuous improvement. For companies that participate in this program, the FDA forgoes conducting routine facility inspections and pre-approval inspections in order to allow participants 
to shift resources to innovation and improvement efforts. We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable FDA and QSR requirements. 
The materials, components, and sub-assemblies of our RNS System, as well as manufacturing services, are provided by qualified and approved suppliers, most of which are single source suppliers. For example, Micro Systems Technologies Management AG and Greatbatch Ltd are single source suppliers of key components of our products, including printed circuit assemblies and batteries. Other qualified and approved suppliers provide additional components, materials, and services, which include silicone adhesive, integrated circuits, and other components. We typically maintain several months’ worth of inventory on critical components. From time to time we have experienced issues with our suppliers. To date, these issues have not had a material impact on our operations. We estimate that qualifying a second source supplier would be a lengthy process. Our suppliers are evaluated, qualified and approved through our supplier management program, which includes various evaluations, assessments, qualifications, validations, testing and inspection to ensure the supplier can meet acceptable quality and regulatory requirements. 
Order quantities and lead times for materials, components, and sub-assemblies purchased from suppliers are based on our forecasts derived from historical demand and anticipated future demand. We perform assembly, testing, inspection and final release activities for our RNS System at our Mountain View, California facility. 
Government Regulation 
Regulation of Medical Devices in the United States
Our RNS System and our operations are subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 and its implementing regulations, collectively referred to as the FDCA, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, preclinical and clinical testing and research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping and reporting, clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export and post-marketing surveillance, to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending premarket applications, issuance of warning letters, mandatory product recalls, import detentions, civil monetary penalties, and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA approval of a PMA, clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, or grant of a de novo request for classification. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II, or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness. Classification of a device is important because the class to which a device is assigned determines, among other things, the necessity and type of FDA review required prior to marketing the device, making changes to the device, or otherwise using the device. 
Class I devices include those with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to the FDA’s “general controls” for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events and malfunctions through the submission of Medical Device Reports, or MDRs, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I or low risk devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below.
Class II devices are moderate risk devices subject to the FDA’s general controls, and any other “special controls” deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries, or post-market surveillance. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) 
premarket notification process, though certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process. When required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, or 510(k), submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, which in some cases may require submission of clinical data. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the FDA will place the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous premarketing requirements.
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices and devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device following a 510(k) submission. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by general or special controls. Submission and FDA approval of a PMA, application is required before marketing of a Class III device can proceed. As with 510(k) submissions, unless an exemption applies, PMA submissions are subject to user fees. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA application is required, which is intended to demonstrate that the device is reasonably safe and effective for its intended use and must be supported by extensive data, typically including data from preclinical studies and clinical trials.
Some pre-amendment devices (devices that were on the market prior to May 28, 1976) are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. 
PMA Approval Pathway
Our RNS System is a Class III device, which required PMA approval before it could be marketed. Additionally, there are certain pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA, which are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is generally more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is reasonably safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review may take and often takes significantly longer, sometimes taking up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. 
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical trial that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional studies post-approval. The FDA may also condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, certain suppliers, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, 
such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Changes to our existing product or the development of new products may require the approval of a PMA or additional submissions of PMA supplements.
510(k) Marketing Clearance Pathway
One of the components of our RNS System, our Burr Hole Cover, which may be used to cover the incision site for depth leads, is subject to premarket notification and clearance under section 510(k) of the FDCA. To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit to the FDA a 510(k) submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, known as a “predicate device.” A legally marketed predicate device may include a pre-amendment device, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate device. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data.
Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) submission for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If the FDA determines that the 510(k) submission is incomplete, the FDA will issue a “Refuse to Accept” letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information within 180 days before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. Once the 510(k) submission is accepted for review, by regulation, the FDA has 90 calendar days to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance may take and often does take longer. Upon review, the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, for example, due to a finding of a lack of a predicate device, that the device has a new intended use or different technological characteristics that raise different questions of safety or effectiveness when the device is compared to the cited predicate device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. If the FDA determines that the information provided in a 510(k) submission is insufficient to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the predicate device, the FDA generally identifies the specific information that needs to be provided so that the FDA may complete its evaluation of substantial equivalence, and such information may be provided within the time allotted by the FDA or in a new 510(k) submission should the original 510(k) submission have been withdrawn.
After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a “letter to file” in which the manufacturer documents the rationale for the change and why a new 510(k) submission is not required. However, the FDA may review such letters to file to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 
De novo Classification
Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II, or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. To market low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, a manufacturer may request a de novo classification. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. A medical device may be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent or a manufacturer may request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. The FDA is required to classify the device within 120 calendar days following receipt of the de novo application, although in practice, the FDA’s review may take significantly longer. During the pendency of the FDA’s review, the FDA may issue an additional information letter, which places the de novo request on hold and stops the review clock pending receipt of the additional information requested. In the event the de novo requestor does not provide the requested information within 180 calendar days, the FDA will consider the de novo request to be withdrawn. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the de novo request for classification if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. In the event the FDA determines the data and information submitted demonstrate that general controls or general and special controls are adequate to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, the FDA will grant the de novo request for classification. When the FDA grants a de novo request for classification, the device is granted marketing authorization and further can serve as a predicate for future devices of that type, through a 510(k) premarket notification. We currently do not have any products with a de novo classification. 
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are typically required to support a PMA, oftentimes for a de novo request for classification, and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. As has and continues to be required for our RNS System, all clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must be approved prior to commencing clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, like our RNS System, purported or represented to be used in supporting or sustaining human life, is for a use that is substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disorders or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. A clinical trial may begin 30 days after receipt of the IDE by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will approve the IDE and, if it is approved, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
In addition, the clinical trials must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by 
the FDA and one or more IRBs, clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA.
If the device is considered a “non-significant risk,” IDE submission to FDA is not required. Instead, only approval from the IRB overseeing the investigation at each clinical trial site is required. Abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements also apply to non-significant risk device studies.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices, or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical trial are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all applicable reporting and record keeping requirements.
Additionally, after a trial begins, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a clinical trial is completed, there can be no assurance that the data generated during a clinical trial will meet the safety and effectiveness endpoints or otherwise produce results that will lead the FDA to grant marketing clearance or approval.
Post-market Regulation
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•Annual Reports: As is required for our RNS System, continued FDA approval may be contingent upon the submission of periodic reports, required under 21 CFR 814.84, at intervals of one year (unless otherwise specified) from the date of approval of the original PMA; 
•Post-Approval Study Report: As is required for our RNS System, continued FDA approval may also be contingent upon the submission of Post-Approval Study data, as requested by the FDA; 
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
•QSR requirements, which require manufacturers and contract manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or “off-label” uses of cleared or approved products;
•requirements related to promotional activities;
•clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
•correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. In general, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials, technical guidance, or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, it could request that we modify our training, technical guidance, or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional, technical guidance, or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.
Manufacturing processes for commercial products are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, design history file, device history records, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of products, which would harm our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with our product, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a clinician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
•untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;
•customer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds;
•recall, detention or seizure of our RNS System or any future products;
•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•refusal of or delay in granting our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products or modified products;
•operating restrictions;
•withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals that are already granted;
•refusal to grant export approval for our RNS System or any future products; or
•criminal prosecution.
Other Healthcare and Privacy Laws
Our RNS System and our operations are also subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. For example, in the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services or reward past purchases or recommendations.
Violations of these laws can lead to significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, disgorgement, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and the forced curtailment or restructuring of our operations. These laws are applicable to us as a medical device company and also apply to hospitals, epileptologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, and other potential purchasers or users of our RNS System or any future products.
In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)) prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Remuneration is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, coupons, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, provision of items or services with independent value such as administrative support, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests, relieving a referral source of a financial or administrative burden, and the provision of anything at less than its fair market value. The federal Anti- Kickback Statute and implementing regulations provide for certain narrow exceptions and “safe harbors” for certain defined practices including discounting, rebating or personal services arrangements, among other things. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of federal Anti- Kickback Statute, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Moreover, the lack of uniform court interpretation of the Anti-Kickback Statute makes compliance with the law difficult.
Violations are also subject to civil monetary penalties, which can be further assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may also result in civil and criminal penalties, including criminal fines and imprisonment, or exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs.
Certain arrangements between medical device companies and referring, or prescribing clinicians have been identified in fraud alerts issued by the OIG as implicating the Anti-Kickback Statute. Moreover, the provision of payments or other items of value by a medical device company to a referral source could be prohibited under the Stark Law (described below) unless the arrangement meets all criteria of an applicable exception. The government has been active in enforcement of these laws as they apply to medical device companies.
Other federal healthcare fraud-related laws also provide criminal liability for violations. The Criminal Healthcare Fraud statute (18 U.S.C. § 1347) prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including payors. Federal criminal law at 18 U.S.C. § 1001, among other sections, prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
The civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted or caused the submission of a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. These laws can apply to entities that provide information on 
coverage, coding, and reimbursement of their products and assistance with obtaining reimbursement to persons who bill payors. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act.
The Civil Monetary Penalty Act of 1981 imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier.
The Stark Law prohibits payments made by a clinician (as defined under such law) to a medical device company in exchange for the delivery of a product or provision of a services, presenting or causing to be presented claims to Medicare and Medicaid for products or services referred by clinicians who personally, or through a family member, have an investment interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, the medical device company manufacturing the product or delivering the service, unless an exception applies. Similarly, medical device companies may not bill Medicare for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited self- referral. Any person who presents or causes to be presented a claim to the Medicare or Medicaid programs in violation of the Stark Law is subject to civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from participation in federal governmental payor programs. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary and exclusion from the federal health care programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the FCA. The statute also provides for additional penalties for a circumvention scheme. In addition, many states, including California, also have state anti-“self-referral” and other laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals, with which we must comply.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, also created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act, which require certain applicable manufacturers of devices, drugs, biologics, kits that required FDA approval or clearance, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors, and teaching hospitals, other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations, and to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to CMS. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties, which can be increased for “knowing failures”, for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations.
Numerous states have enacted laws prohibiting business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine and other professions and employing or engaging physicians and other professionals to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. These laws are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed professional. Violation of these corporate practice of medicine laws may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against the 
business corporation and/or the professional through licensure proceedings and programs and criminal penalties. In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, although many of these laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a governmental payor program.
Laws Governing Foreign Business Activities
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments in violation of law to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. Other U.S. companies in the medical device and pharmaceutical field have faced criminal penalties under the FCPA for allowing their agents to deviate from appropriate practices in doing business with foreign government officials. We may also become subject to similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we decide to operate, including the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act of 2010, which also prohibits commercial bribery and makes it a crime for companies to fail to prevent bribery. We may also become subject to a wide variety of other foreign laws, rules, regulations and standards, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or the GDPR, and other foreign data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and standards (including as described below). Violations of these laws could result in severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, and other remedial measures. Any violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could involve significant costs and expenses, including legal fees, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business operations and revenue.
U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
Medicare is a federal program administered by CMS through fiscal intermediaries, Medicare Administrative Contractors and carriers. Available to individuals age 65 or over, and certain other individuals, the Medicare program provides, among other things, healthcare benefits that cover, within prescribed limits, the major costs of most medically necessary care for such individuals, subject to certain deductibles and copayments.
CMS has established guidelines for the coverage and reimbursement of certain products and procedures by Medicare. In general, in order to be reimbursed by Medicare, a healthcare procedure furnished to a Medicare beneficiary must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury, or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part. The methodology for determining coverage status and the amount of Medicare reimbursement varies based upon, among other factors, the setting in which a Medicare beneficiary received healthcare products and services. Any changes in federal legislation, regulations and policy affecting CMS coverage and reimbursement relative to the procedures of implanting or using our RNS System could have a material effect on our performance.
CMS also administers the Medicaid program, a cooperative federal/state program that provides medical assistance benefits to qualifying low income and medically needy persons. State participation in Medicaid is optional, and each state is given discretion in developing and administering its own Medicaid program, subject to certain federal requirements pertaining to payment levels, eligibility criteria and minimum categories of services. The coverage, method and level of reimbursement vary from state to state and is subject to each state’s budget restraints. Changes to the availability of coverage, method or level of reimbursement for our RNS System and supplemental procedures may affect future revenue negatively if reimbursement amounts are decreased or discontinued.
All CMS programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate adjustments, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy, intermediary determinations, and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease the rate of program payments to healthcare facilities and other healthcare providers, including those paid for the implantation of our RNS System and supplemental procedures.
United States Health Reform
Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our RNS System and future products. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenue and impact sales of and reimbursement for our RNS System and future products. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and 
private insurers, and significantly impacts our industry. The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our RNS System and any future products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our RNS System and any future products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our RNS System and any future products.
The implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the United States, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, a 2.3% federal excise tax, with limited exceptions, on any entity that manufactures or imports Class I, II and III medical devices offered for sale in the United States that began on January 1, 2013. Through a series of legislative amendments, the tax was suspended for 2016 through 2019. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, signed into law on December 20, 2019, has repealed the medical device excise tax and as a result of the repeal and the prior moratorium, sales of taxable medical devices after December 31, 2015, are not subject to the tax. The Affordable Care Act also provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act has expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. We continue to evaluate the full impact that the Affordable Care Act will have on our business. The Biden Administration and the U.S. Congress may take further action regarding the Affordable Care Act, including, but not limited to, amendment and expansion. During its history, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, such as enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts, which, among other things, removed penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance, known as the individual mandate. On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in Affordable Care Act marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included reductions to CMS payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced CMS payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, was enacted in response to COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act made various tax law changes, including among other things (i) increased the limitation under IRC Section 163(j) for 2019 and 2020 to permit additional expensing of interest (ii) enacted technical corrections so that qualified improvement property can be immediately expensed under IRC Section 168(k) and net operating losses arising in tax years beginning in 2017 and ending in 2018 can be carried back two years and carried forward twenty years without a taxable income limitation as opposed to carried forward 
indefinitely, and (iii) made modifications to the federal net operating loss rules including permitting federal net operating losses incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back to the five preceding taxable years. The provisions of the CARES Act were not materially impactful on our tax positions.
The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law on March 11, 2021 expanding the definition of covered employees as defined under IRC Section 162(m). The provisions under the expanded definition of covered employees have been considered and were determined not to be materially impactful on our tax positions.
We believe that there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the current regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed by the Biden administration or what the impact of such changes on our business, if any, may be. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the rates we will be able to charge for our RNS System and future products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our RNS System and future products from governmental agencies or third-party payors. Current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, established uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and requires certain entities, called covered entities, to comply with standards that include the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI. HIPAA also requires business associates and their covered subcontractors, such as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that have access to PHI in connection with providing a service to or on behalf of a covered entity, of covered entities to enter into business associate agreements with the covered entity and to safeguard the covered entity’s PHI against improper use and disclosure. In addition, companies, such as many medical device companies, that would not otherwise be subject to HIPAA may become contractually obligated to follow certain HIPAA requirements through agreements with Covered Entities and Business Associates, and some of our customers may require us to comply with certain of these provisions.
As a company that maintains a substantial amount of patient-level data and interacts frequently with both Covered Entities and Business Associates, we may have certain obligations regarding the use and disclosure of any PHI that may be provided to us or data that is generated by us. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of HIPAA, HITECH or their implementing regulations, and similar state laws, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
We are also subject to numerous other federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, regulations and standards related to data privacy, security and protection, including consumer protection laws and regulations that govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of patient health and other personal information. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation.
In addition, Congress and various other states have enacted or are considering new laws and regulations regarding the privacy and security of heath and other personal information to which we may become subject. Further, all 50 states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, such as prompt disclosure to affected customers. In addition to data breach notification laws, some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information. We intend to continue to protect all personal information in our control and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of such information.
In addition, as noted above, we are planning for regulatory clearances in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the EU, Canada, and Japan, and therefore would be subject to non-U.S. data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations 
and standards as our operations expand. For example, the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the GDPR, which took effect across all member states of the European Economic Area, or EEA, in May 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR increases obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA by expanding the definition of personal data to include coded data and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial subjects and investigators. In addition, the GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S. and, as a result, increases the scrutiny that such rules should apply to transfers of personal data from clinical trial sites located in the EEA to the U.S. The GDPR also permits data protection authorities to require destruction of improperly gathered or used personal information and/or impose substantial fines for violations of the GDPR, which can be up to four percent of global revenues or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR provides that EU member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of personal data, including genetic, biometric, or health data.
For more information regarding the risks related to data privacy and security, please see “Risk Factors—Our collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer and other processing of sensitive, and personal information subject us to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and security that could give rise to significant costs, liabilities and other risks, including as a result of investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices, which may disrupt our business operations and harm our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects and cause other adverse business consequences.”
