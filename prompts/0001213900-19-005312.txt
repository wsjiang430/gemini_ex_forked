ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Conversion Labs, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is the parent company of majority-owned subsidiaries LegalSimpli Software, LLC, a Puerto Rico limited liability company, Conversion Labs PR, LLC (formerly Immudyne PR LLC), a Puerto Rico limited liability company, and Conversion Labs Asia Limited, a Hong Kong company. Conversion Labs, Inc. was formed in the State of Delaware on May 24, 1994, under our prior name, Immudyne, Inc. We changed our name to Conversion Labs, Inc. on June 22, 2018. Further, in connection with changing its name, the Company changed its trading symbol to CVLB.
Business Overview
 
Conversion Labs, Inc. is a diversified online direct response marketing company that creates, in-licenses, and acquires proprietary and innovative consumer products that address large unmet needs in the online marketplace. We sell our products directly to consumers through advertisements on Facebook, Google, Amazon, and other social media and e-commerce platforms. Secondarily, we sell our products to traditional retailers, wholesalers and physicians’ offices.
 
We currently have four commercial stage brands in our portfolio:
 

● | Shapiro MD: Launched in 2017, Shapiro MD is a patented line of shampoo, conditioner and leave-in foamer for thicker, fuller hair. The Shapiro MD line also includes a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved minoxidil product and a supplement for hair loss. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | iNR Wellness MD: Launched in 2018, iNR Wellness MD is a beta glucan nutritional supplement for immune support. There are a multitude of published studies, many noted on the National Institute of Health website, relating to the health benefits of beta glucan. The FDA and the European Food Safety Authority have approved health claims related to the maintenance or reduction of blood cholesterol and consumption of 3 grams of beta-glucan daily. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Scarology: Launched in 2019, Scarology is a proprietary 3 step Scar Care System designed to improve the overall color, texture and appearance of scars. The system consists of a natural fruit acid exfoliator, a proprietary scar healing cream and silicon scar sheets. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | PDF Simpli: Launched in 2018, PDF Simpli is a PDF conversion software-as-a-service (SaaS) product, which was acquired through the purchase of 51% of the membership interests of LegalSimpli Software, LLC, a Puerto Rico limited liability company, which operates a marketing-driven software solutions business. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We launched our online direct marketing business in the fourth quarter of 2015 with the establishment of a partnership with Inate Skincare, LLC (“Inate”). Our initial intention was to launch a skin care line containing our proprietary ingredients and to market such products directly to consumers. We entered into a limited liability company operating agreement with our joint venture partners with respect to Inate under the legal name Immudyne PR LLC (“Immudyne PR”). On April 1, 2016, the original operating agreement of Immudyne PR was amended and restated and we increased our ownership and voting interest in Immudyne PR to 78.2%. Subsequently, concurrent with the name change of the parent company to Conversion Labs, Inc., Immudyne PR was renamed to Conversion Labs PR LLC.

Our priority is to pursue opportunities to market our products and increase sales. We expect that a significant component of our selling, general and administration expenses going forward will consist of advertising expenses and service fees to maintain skilled professionals to market our products online. These aforementioned costs, along with the additional costs resulting from our operations as a public reporting company, could adversely impact our future results of operations.
 
Divestiture of Nutraceutical and Cosmetic Additives Business
 
Throughout 2017, we manufactured, distributed and sold natural immune support products containing our proprietary yeast beta glucans, a group of beta glucans naturally occurring in the cell walls of yeast that have been shown through testing and analysis to support the immune system. Beta glucans, or β-Glucans, are a natural extract that are considered to be “biological response modifiers” that support the immune system. The most common sources of beta glucans are from the cell walls of baker’s yeast, the cellulose in plants, the bran of cereal grains and certain fungi and bacteria.
 
In the first quarter of 2018 we sold all assets and liabilities related to our legacy business that manufactured raw yeast beta glucan. As a result of this divestiture, we now solely operate our online direct marketing business through our majority-owned operating subsidiary, Conversion Labs PR.
 
Our Products
 
We currently have four commercial stage brands. Generally, our business model is to license or acquire innovative products that address large, global unmet needs which can be placed onto our internet based or “online” direct response marketing platform. We seek to protect the market position of our products with intellectual property, trade secrets, trademarks and brand equity. Our brands and products are as follows:
 
Shapiro MD®
 
Launched in the second quarter of 2017, Shapiro MD is a patented line of hair products designed to help men and women regain thicker, fuller and healthier looking hair. The products in our Shapiro MD line currently include a shampoo, a conditioner, a leave-in foamer, and a “product” which contains Minoxidil, an FDA-approved product for hair growth. Additionally, we are in the process of adding an FDA-cleared laser cap to our Shapiro MD product line. The Shapiro MD Shampoo and Conditioner are the result of 15 years of research and development by Dr. Steven Shapiro and Dr. Michael Borenstein. The Shapiro MD product line is protected by two U.S. patents and typically contains three naturally-occurring dihydrotestosterone (DHT) blocking ingredients. DHT is widely believed to be the main culprit of balding/hair-loss. Clinical research on the ingredients used in Shapiro MD products has been published in scientific journals, including U.S. National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health, International Journal of Dermatology and European Hair Research Society.
 
iNR Wellness MD®
 
Launched in 2018, iNR Wellness MD is a nutritional supplement for immune support. The iNR Wellness product line is a daily nutritional supplement that contains yeast, oat, and mushroom beta glucans. Beta glucans, or β-Glucans, are a natural extract considered to be “biological response modifiers” that support the immune system. Our three naturally occurring beta glucans have clinically shown to support the human immune system and are commonly used as an OTC supplement to reduce cholesterol levels, maintain healthy blood glucose levels, and support the immune system. Our spokespersons for our iNR Wellness MD brand include Dr. Joseph DiTrolio, Dr. Jack Gilbert, and Dr. Liz Lipski, who are leading doctors/researchers in fields such as urology, microbiology, and nutrition. General scientific research on beta glucans has been conducted in recent years by renowned medical laboratories, including Baylor College of Medicine, U.S. Armed Forces Radiobiology Institute, Stanford University, Harvard University, and North Carolina State University. As more studies are conducted on beta glucans, we believe the potential benefits to human health will continue to emerge. Although the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has historically endorsed the consumption of oat glucan/dietary fiber as an aid to lower cholesterol, most of the testing and analysis or scientific research mentioned in this annual report has not been subject to oversight of the FDA or any comparable regulatory body, and no regulatory body has attested to the efficacy of beta glucans in supporting the immune system or treating disease. Further, the marketing of beta glucans is not subject to FDA approval, and we are prohibited by Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and FDA regulations from suggesting in advertisements and product labels that our products mitigate, treat, cure or prevent a specific disease or class of disease.

PDF Simpli
 
Launched in 2018, PDFSimpli is a PDF conversion software, which we acquired in June 2018 through the purchase of 51% of the membership interests of LegalSimpli Software, LLC, a Puerto Rico limited liability company. PDFSimpli enables users to convert, edit and sign PDF documents and has had over 3 terabytes of documents converted or edited by customers from the legal, financial, real-estate and academic sectors. As of February 28, 2019, PDFSimpli was ranked in the top 100,000 websites globally, in which it was also ranked in the top 2,500 for specific countries and has more than 650,000 registered users globally. PDFSimpli has had over 3 terabytes of documents converted or edited by customers from the legal, financial, real-estate and academic sectors.
 
Scarology™
 
Launched in 2018, Scarology is a topically applied scar healing solution delivered through a day and night routine. The system consists of a natural fruit acid exfoliator, a proprietary scar healing cream and silicon scar sheets. The Scarology system was developed by two prominent dermatologists and has been tested extensively in a clinical environment. The current global scar treatment market, per Grand View Research’s 2017 Scar Treatment Industry Market Research Report, is estimated to be more than $10 billion and is expected to grow to more than $34.5 billion by 2025.
Growth Strategy
 
We actively seek to acquire, license and develop products and brands with large untapped e-commerce potential and proven business models. We intend to continue to grow revenue and profitability of our commercial stage consumer products. We also expect that PDFSimpli will continue to grow and will achieve profitability in 2019. We continue to actively seek new brands to buy or license to expand our product offerings and add to our growth.
 
We have begun selling all of our products in international markets and we believe this represents a significant growth opportunity for us. We also entered into a strategic partnership in Asia in 2018. Accordingly, we are in the process of building an e-commerce infrastructure in Asia where we anticipate completion in the first half of 2019.
 
In early 2019, we also launched a service-based business under the name Conversion Labs Media LLC, which will be used to run e-commerce marketing campaigns for other online businesses. Conversion Labs Media LLC intends to develop, run, and optimize advertising and media strategies for third parties looking to continue their growth on online platforms such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook. These services will be monetized through a monthly consulting model or on a revenue share basis.
 
Marketing
 
We advertise our products on social media platforms, search engines, Amazon, and third-party websites or selling platforms (the “Marketing Platforms”). We develop marketing content, such as images or videos (the “Marketing Content”), that we pay to have marketed through the Marketing Platforms. We manage the cost per click, customer acquisition cost, and other key performance indicators on the Marketing Platforms to determine if certain campaigns are successful. When a potential customer clicks on the Marketing Content, they are typically taken to landing pages for specific campaigns that show the offer of our brands where they can purchase our products online.
 
In early 2019, we also launched a service-based business under the name Conversion Labs Media LLC, which will be used to run e-commerce marketing campaigns for other online businesses. Under this entity, we will create similar Marketing Content and landing pages, which we may manage for clients on the Marketing Platforms.
 
Manufacturing
 
We use third-parties to manufacture and package our products according to the formulas and packaging guidelines we dictate. In order to minimize costs, we may elect to purchase raw or bulk materials directly from our suppliers and have them shipped to our manufacturers so that we may incur only “tableting,” encapsulating and/or packaging costs and avoid the additional costs associated with purchasing the finished product.

We are dependent on certain third-party manufacturers, although we believe that other contract manufacturers could be quickly secured if any of our current manufacturers cease to perform adequately. As of December 31, 2018, we utilized two (2) suppliers for finished goods, three (3) suppliers for packaging and bottles and one (1) supplier for labeling. For the period ended December 31, 2018, we purchased 100% of our finished goods from two (2) manufacturers.
 
We have not experienced any material adverse effect on our business as a result of shortages of raw materials or packaging materials used in the manufacturing of our products. An unexpected interruption or a shortage in supply could adversely affect our business derived from these products. We are not substantially dependent on any raw material supplier or packaging supplier since alternative sources of materials, with equal quality, could be quickly obtained if any of our current suppliers cease to supply us adequately.
 
We rely on our contract manufacturers to maintain the quality of product components as new products are assessed and developed. As we evaluate the needs for certain products within existing or new markets, we develop the most effective formulas and rely on our third-party suppliers to provide certain raw materials and our manufacturers to manufacture the product. Products are then sampled and tested for final approval and packaging. To monitor the quality of the raw materials that the suppliers provide and the products that the third-party manufacturers produce, we randomly test our products through independent labs to ensure potency. In addition, we select those manufacturers who themselves adhere to high standards of good manufacturing practices.
 
Competition
 
The markets we sell into are large and highly competitive. Numerous online brands compete with us for customers throughout the United States and internationally in the hair loss, scarring, immune support and PDF conversion verticals. We also compete with traditional mass merchandisers, drug store chains, independent pharmacies and health food stores.
 
With respect to our consumer products, we believe that our competitive advantage lies in the quality of our products, endorsements of our products from opinion-leading physicians and experts, and, most importantly, our ability to optimally market our products directly to consumers.
 
The Company’s competitors include, among others, Guthy Renker LLC, L’Oréal S.A., Atlantic Coast Media Group, LLC, Hims, Inc. and The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and more experienced than us, have longer operating histories, higher visibility and brand recognition and have materially greater financial and other resources than us. We may not be able to successfully compete with them in the marketplace.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We regard our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and we rely on trademark and copyright law, trade-secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain proprietary rights, technologies or copyrighted materials from third-parties and we rely on those third-parties to defend their proprietary rights, copyrights and technologies.
 
From time-to-time, we register our principal brand names in the United States and certain foreign countries. Our material trademarks include Shapiro MD®, iNR Wellness MD®, Scarology™ and Purpurex®. We currently own these brand names as registered trademarks and substantially all of our net sales were from products bearing these brands. The steps we take to protect our proprietary rights in our brand names may not be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of our brand names in the United States or abroad. Existing trademark laws afford only limited practical protection for our product lines. The laws and the level of enforcement of such laws in certain foreign countries where we market our products often do not protect our proprietary rights in our products to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Because of the rapid pace of the natural product industry’s development, we believe that the legal protection for our product is less significant to our success than the knowledge, technical expertise and marketing skills of our personnel, the frequency of product expansion and pace of market penetration.

We rely primarily on proprietary trade secrets and extensive experience to operate our online direct response marketing platform. We have two U.S. patents relating to our Shapiro MD products’ method for treatment of hair loss with a combination of natural ingredients with one granted on March 24, 2015 and the other on January 3, 2017. In order to protect the confidentiality of our intellectual property, including trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary technical and business information, it is our policy to limit access to such information to those who require access in order to perform their functions and to enter into agreements with employees, consultants and vendors to contractually protect such information.
 
Government and Environmental Regulation
 
Our business is heavily regulated by the FDA and the FTC. The FDA enforces the FDCA and Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (“DSHEA”) as they pertain to foods, food ingredients, cosmetics and dietary supplement production and marketing. Dietary supplements are regulated as a category of food, not as drugs. We are not required to obtain FDA pre-market approval to sell our products in the United States under current laws. Our hair loss and scarring products are regulated as cosmetics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
 
The FDA imposes GMP guidelines to ensure that dietary supplements are produced in a quality manner, do not contain contaminants or impurities and are accurately labeled. GMPs include requirements for establishing quality control procedures, designing and constructing manufacturing plants, testing ingredients and finished products and record keeping and handling of consumer product complaints. The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal law applicable to dietary supplements and cosmetics, including the power to monitor claims made in product labeling, to seize adulterated or misbranded products or unapproved new drugs, to request product recall, to enjoin further manufacture or sale of a product, to issue warning letters and to institute criminal proceedings.
 
Advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy of products are also regulated by the FTC. The FTC regulates the advertising of dietary supplements, cosmetics and other health-related products to ensure that any advertising is truthful and not misleading, and that an advertiser maintains adequate substantiation for all product claims. FTC enforcement actions may result in consent decrees, cease and desist orders, judicial injunctions and the payment of fines with respect to advertising claims that are found to be unsubstantiated.
 
Under current U.S. regulations, our products must comply with certain labeling requirements enforced by the FDA and FTC, but otherwise generally are not required to receive regulatory approval prior to introduction into the U.S. market. We believe that we are in compliance with all material government regulations applicable to our products.
 
In addition to the foregoing, our operations are subject to federal, foreign, state and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to zoning, workplace safety and accommodations for the disabled, and our relationship with our employees is subject to regulations, including minimum wage requirements, anti-discrimination laws, overtime, working conditions and citizenship requirements. We currently do not incur any material costs in connection with our compliance with applicable environmental laws as our manufacturing processes generate minimal discharge. Furthermore, the cost of maintaining compliance with applicable environmental laws has not, and we believe, in the future, will not, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all material governmental regulations applicable to our operations.
 
Employees
 
As of March 29, 2019, we have 16 full-time and no part-time employees. Our full-time employees work in the following places:
 

● | Five in Huntington, Beach, CA under Conversion Labs, Inc. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Seven in San Juan, PR under Conversion Labs PR LLC 
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | Four in San Juan, PR under Legal Simpli Software LLC 
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 
None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
