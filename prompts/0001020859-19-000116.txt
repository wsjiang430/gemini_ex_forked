ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report” or “Report”), unless otherwise specified, references to “United Natural Foods”, “UNFI”, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company” mean United Natural Foods, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries. We are a Delaware corporation based in Providence, Rhode Island and Eden Prairie, Minnesota. We conduct our business through various subsidiaries. Since the formation of our predecessor in 1976, we have grown our business both organically and through acquisitions, which have expanded our distribution network, product selection and customer base.
Overview
As a leading distributor of natural, organic, specialty, produce, and conventional grocery and non-food products, and provider of support services in the United States and Canada, we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide the broadest array of products and services to customers throughout North America. We offer more than 250,000 products consisting of national, regional and private label brands grouped into six product categories: grocery and general merchandise; produce; perishables and frozen foods; nutritional supplements and sports nutrition; bulk and food service products and personal care items. Through our October 2018 acquisition of SUPERVALU INC. (“Supervalu”), we are transforming into North America’s premier wholesaler with 63 distribution centers and warehouses representing approximately 32 million square feet of warehouse space. We believe our total product assortment and service offerings are unmatched by our wholesale competitors. We plan to aggressively pursue new business opportunities to independent retailers who operate diverse formats, regional and national chains, military commissaries, as well as international customers with wide-ranging needs.
Our Values and Impact
We believe that better food comes from a healthy planet. We are focused on doing our part to protect the environment, conserve natural resources and promote sustainability. We invest in the efficiency of our transportation fleet and warehouses, generate on-site solar power for operational use, and focus on diverting waste from landfills. The communities where we live and work are part of who we are as a company. We believe that part of doing the right thing includes supporting these communities and helping those in need where we can. The UNFI Foundation makes grants to nonprofits to inspire better food systems and nurture everyday health. We also encourage our associates to make a difference by volunteering their time in their communities.
We believe that freedom of food choice matters, and every day we strive to deliver better food options to more tables across North America. We are a pioneer in the distribution of high-quality natural and organic and specialty food products. We believe that through the acquisition of Supervalu, we have increased opportunities to deliver better food options to new communities and customers. Social and environmental responsibility is integral to our overall business strategy, and we believe these practices deliver significant value to our stakeholders, including our shareholders, associates, customers, suppliers and communities. In addition, we focus on developing and maintaining practices and procedures to keep our workplaces safe. 
Our Strategic Priorities
We are focused on five strategic priorities that we believe will contribute to our future success:

1) | Embracing our core mission to transform the world of food and recognizing that our culture of safety and integrity is at the forefront of everything we do.


2) | Delivering on our financial commitments, driving performance to achieve financial targets. Financially, we are focused on the successful integration of Supervalu into UNFI, realizing cost synergies, optimizing our distribution center network, driving cross-selling of products and services across our businesses, and generating cash to pay down debt.


3) | Building out the store through effectively selling our entire portfolio of products and services, which provide differentiated solutions for our customers.


4) | Deploying Thrive2, our project to drive integrated work streams, which provide better experiences for our customers, associates and suppliers and allow us to realize synergy benefits from simplification. The implementation of an efficient, standardized operating model powers better experiences for associates, customers and suppliers.


5) | Divesting our retail assets in a thoughtful and economic manner.

Our Customers
We maintain long-standing relationships with our customers. We serve approximately 30,000 unique customer locations, including customers acquired from the Supervalu acquisition, primarily located across the United States and Canada, which we classify into four customer types:

• | Supermarkets, which include accounts that also carry conventional products, and include chain accounts, supermarket independents, and gourmet and ethnic specialty stores.


• | Supernatural, which consists of chain accounts that are national in scope and carry primarily natural products, and currently consists solely of Whole Foods Market.


• | Independents, which include single store and chain accounts (excluding supernatural, as defined above), which carry primarily natural products and buying clubs of consumer groups joined to buy products.


• | Other, which includes foodservice, e-commerce and international customers outside of Canada, as well as sales to Amazon.com, Inc.

We have been the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market for more than twenty years. Under the terms of our agreement with Whole Foods Market, we serve as the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market in all of its regions in the United States. Our agreement with Whole Foods Market expires on September 28, 2025. Whole Foods Market is our only customer that represented more than 10% of total net sales in fiscal 2019. Our customers include single and multiple store independent grocery store retailers, regional chains and the military, many of which are long tenured customers.
The following were included among our wholesale customers for fiscal 2019:

• | Whole Foods Market, the largest supernatural chain in the United States and Canada; and


• | Cash and Carry Stores, The Fresh Market, Coborn’s, Natural Grocers, Jerry’s Foods, Vitamin Cottage, Festival Foods, All American Quality Foods, Ahold Delhaize banners (Giant-Carlisle, Stop & Shop, Giant-Landover, and Hannaford), Superior Grocers, Vallarta Supermarkets, Wegmans, Raley’s, Redner’s Markets, Neiman's Family Market, Dierberg’s, El Super Supermarkets, Earth Fare, Sprouts Farmers Market, Lucky’s, Kroger, Harris Teeter, Giant Eagle, Market Basket, Shop-Rite, Publix, Raley’s, and Loblaws. 

Our total international net sales, including those by UNFI Canada, Inc. (“UNFI Canada”) and excluding sales transacted in U.S. dollars and shipped internationally, represented approximately one percent of our net sales in fiscal 2019, three percent in fiscal 2018 and four percent in fiscal 2017. We believe that our sales outside the United States will expand as we seek to continue to grow our Canadian operations.
Recent Acquisitions
A key component of our business and growth strategy has been to acquire wholesalers differentiated by product offerings, service offerings and market area. We believe the expanded product and service offerings from these acquisitions has enhanced and will continue to enhance our ability to acquire new customers and present opportunities for cross-selling complementary product lines. The Supervalu acquisition advanced our “Build Out The Store” strategy and brought incremental capabilities to the Company in these areas. We now carry an unmatched product assortment that allows us to cross-sell natural products to conventional customers and conventional products to natural customers, all while reducing the number of weekly deliveries that each receives. Supervalu also brings a robust suite of services that are now available to our natural customer base, services necessary to run their business and provide opportunities to simplify and focus on their operations. We also believe the Supervalu acquisition will provide additional scale to lower our overall costs. Finally, we are now a coast-to-coast distributor with customers in all fifty states as well as all ten provinces in Canada, making us a desirable partner for consumer product manufacturers.
Our recent business acquisitions include:

• | Supervalu. On October 22, 2018, we acquired Supervalu for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion, which included the assumption of outstanding debt and liabilities. The acquisition of Supervalu accelerates our build out the store strategy, diversifies the Company’s customer base, enables cross-selling opportunities, expands market reach and scale, enhances technology, capacity and systems, and is expected to deliver significant cost synergies and accelerate potential growth.

2


• | Gourmet Guru. In August 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Gourmet Guru Inc. (“Gourmet Guru”) in a cash transaction for approximately $10.0 million. Gourmet Guru is a distributor and merchandiser of fresh and organic food focusing on new and emerging brands. We believe that our acquisition of Gourmet Guru enhances our strength in finding and cultivating emerging fresh and organic brands and further expands our presence in key urban markets. Gourmet Guru’s operations have been combined with the Company’s existing broadline natural, organic and specialty distribution business in the United States. 


• | Haddon House. In May 2016, the Company acquired Haddon House Food Products Inc. (“Haddon”) and certain affiliated entities and real estate for total cash consideration of approximately $217.5 million. Haddon is a distributor and merchandiser of natural and organic and gourmet ethnic products throughout the Eastern United States. Haddon has a diverse, multi-channel customer base including supermarkets, gourmet food stores and independent retailers. Our acquisition of Haddon has expanded our gourmet and ethnic product and service offering which continues to play an important role in our ongoing strategy to build out these product categories. Haddon’s operations have been combined with the Company’s existing broadline natural, organic and specialty distribution business in the United States.


• | Nor-Cal Produce. In March 2016, the Company acquired Nor-Cal Produce, Inc. (“Nor-Cal”) and an affiliated entity as well as certain real estate, in a cash transaction for approximately $67.8 million. Nor-Cal is a distributor of conventional and organic produce and other fresh products primarily to independent retailers in Northern California, with primary operations located in West Sacramento, California. Our acquisition of Nor-Cal has aided in our efforts to expand our fresh offering, particularly with conventional produce. Nor-Cal’s operations have been combined with the existing Albert’s Organics, Inc. (“Albert’s”) business.


• | Albert’s Organics. In March 2016, the Company acquired certain assets of Global Organic/Specialty Source, Inc. and related affiliates (collectively “Global Organic”) through our wholly owned subsidiary Albert’s Organics, Inc. (“Albert’s”), in a cash transaction for approximately $20.6 million. Global Organic is a distributor of organic fruits, vegetables, juices, milk, eggs, nuts, and coffee located in Sarasota, Florida serving customer locations across the Southeastern United States. Global Organic’s operations have been fully integrated into the existing Albert’s business in the Southeastern United States.


• | Tony’s. In July 2014, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Tony’s Fine Foods (“Tony’s”), through our wholly-owned subsidiary UNFI West, Inc. (“UNFI West”). With the completion of the transaction, Tony’s became a wholly-owned subsidiary and continues to operate as Tony’s Fine Foods. Tony’s is headquartered in West Sacramento, California and is a leading distributor of perishable food products, including a wide array of specialty protein, cheese, deli, food service and bakery goods to retail and specialty grocers, food service customers and other distribution companies principally located throughout the Western United States, as well as Alaska and Hawaii. 

During fiscal 2015, we began shipping customers both center of the store products and an enhanced selection of fresh, perishable products typically located in the perimeter of the store. Our customers utilized both UNFI’s broadline and Tony’s perishable offerings, including grocery, refrigerated, protein, specialty cheese and prepared foods. Our customers seek a full spectrum of offerings and we believe that there is significant value in UNFI’s position as a leading provider of logistics, distribution and category management for both center of the store and perimeter products.
Our Operating Structure
Our continuing operations are organized as follows:

• | our Wholesale reportable segment includes:


◦ | our broadline natural, organic and specialty distribution business in the United States, including our Select Nutrition business which distributes vitamins, minerals and supplements;


◦ | our Supervalu conventional business, which distributes conventional grocery and other products, and includes a private brands business with the Essential Everyday®, Wild Harvest®, and Culinary Circle® brands, and provides logistics and professional service solutions to retailers across the United States and internationally;


◦ | Tony’s, which distributes a wide array of specialty protein, cheese, deli, foodservice and bakery goods, principally throughout the Western United States;


◦ | Albert’s, which distributes organically grown produce and non-produce perishable items within the United States, and includes the operations of Nor-Cal, a distributor of organic and conventional produce and non-produce perishable items principally in Northern California; and


◦ | UNFI Canada, which is our natural, organic and specialty distribution business in Canada.


• | our manufacturing and branded products businesses include the following operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds of a reportable segment:


◦ | our Blue Marble Brands branded product lines; and


◦ | Woodstock Farms Manufacturing.

In recent years, our sales to existing and new customers have increased through:

• | the continued growth of the natural and organic products industry in general;


• | increased market share as a result of our high quality service and a broader product selection, including specialty products;


• | the acquisition of, or merger with, natural and specialty products distributors and most recently the largest publicly traded conventional distributor, Supervalu;


• | the expansion of our existing distribution centers;


• | the construction of new distribution centers;


• | the introduction of new products and the development of our own line of natural, organic and conventional branded products.

Through these efforts, we believe that we have been able to broaden our geographic penetration, expand our customer base, enhance and diversify our product selections, increase our market share, increase operating efficiencies in existing facilities and open new facilities. Our strategic plan includes increasing the type of products we distribute to our customers, including perishable products and conventional produce to “build out the store” and cover center of the store, as well as perimeter offerings. 
Wholesale
Subsequent to August 3, 2019, we reorganized our sales organization into four regions led by four region presidents. The regions consist of Atlantic, South, Central and Pacific. The region president in each region is responsible for product and service strategy, execution, and financial results. Product and service categories include, grocery, fresh, wellness, private brands, e-commerce, food service and multi-cultural. This new structure combines our legacy natural sales organization and distribution center network with our legacy conventional sales organization and distribution network offering our customers a consolidated supply solution. Territory managers in these regions now sell across our complete lines of products. This change brings us to our customers more frequently with all of our service offerings and we anticipate identifying and taking advantage of sales opportunities that result from our customers having a single point of contact for all of our products and services.
Certain of our distribution centers are shared across business components.
Tony’s operates out of four distribution centers located in California and Washington. In addition to the four Tony’s facilities, the Company distributes Tony’s perishable products from certain of our other broadline distribution centers, including our Aurora, Colorado facility. 
Albert’s operates out of eight distribution centers located throughout the United States. Four of the eight distribution centers are co-located with other wholesale operations. 
UNFI Canada distributes natural, organic and specialty products to our Canada customers. As of our 2019 fiscal year end, UNFI Canada operated four distribution centers.
Through Select Nutrition, we distribute more than 12,000 health and beauty aids, vitamins, minerals and supplements from distribution centers in Pennsylvania and California.
As a result of the Supervalu acquisition we’ve added 11 brands with over 4,000 stock-keeping units (“SKUs”) sold exclusively and reported as sales through our Wholesale segment. These brands span the value, national brand equivalent, organic and premium quality tiers.
Manufacturing and Natural Branded Products Businesses
Our Blue Marble Brands portfolio is a collection of 17 organic, non-GMO, clean and specialty food brands representing more than 700 unique retail and food service products sourced from over 30 countries around the globe. Blue Marble Brands defines clean ingredients to be minimally processed foods, using only essential ingredients that contain no artificial colors or flavors. Our Blue Marble Brands products are sold through our Wholesale segment, third-party distributors and directly to retailers. Our Field Day® brand is primarily sold to customers in our independent channel and is meant to serve as a private label brand for retailers to allow them to compete with supermarket and supernatural chains which often have their own private label store brands.
Our subsidiary doing business as Woodstock Farms Manufacturing specializes in importing, roasting, packaging and the distribution of nuts, dried fruit, seeds, trail mixes, granola, natural and organic snack items and confections for our customers and in the Company’s branded products. Woodstock Farms Manufacturing sells items manufactured in bulk and through private label packaging arrangements with large health food, supermarket and convenience store chains and independent retailers.

We operate an organic (United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and Quality Assurance International (“QAI”)) and kosher (Circle K) certified packaging, roasting, and processing facility in New Jersey that is SQF (Safety Quality Food) level 2 certified.
To maintain our market position and improve our operating efficiencies, we seek to continually:

• | expand our marketing and customer service programs across regions;


• | expand our national purchasing opportunities;


• | offer a broader product selection than our competitors;


• | offer operational excellence with high service levels and a higher percentage of on-time deliveries than our competitors;


• | centralize general and administrative functions to reduce expenses;


• | consolidate systems applications among physical locations and regions;


• | increase our investment in people, facilities, equipment and technology;


• | integrate administrative and accounting functions; and


• | reduce the geographic overlap between regions.

Our continued growth has allowed us to expand our existing facilities and open new facilities in an effort to achieve increasing operating efficiencies. 
Retail
In fiscal 2019, we acquired retail operations that are classified as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. As of August 3, 2019, our discontinued operations include 96 retail grocery stores acquired in the Supervalu acquisition. Our intent is to thoughtfully and economically divest these stores. For financial reporting purposes, sales from our distribution centers to our Shopper’s retail banner are eliminated within the Wholesale segment, as we do not expect to dispose of the business with a supply agreement. Wholesale segment sales to our Cub Foods retail banner are not eliminated within the Wholesale segment or total net sales, as we expect and are marketing the business for sale with a supply agreement. In addition, Wholesale segment sales to our Hornbacher’s retail banner disposed during fiscal 2019 were not eliminated through the closing date, and now continue to be recognized as sales to a third-party. 
We disposed of our Earth Origins Market (“Earth Origins”) retail business during fiscal 2018, which was not classified in discontinued operations.
Our Products and Services
Our Product Offering
Our extensive selection of products includes natural, organic and specialty foods and non-food products and includes nationally advertised brand name and private-label products, including grocery (both perishable and nonperishable), general merchandise, home, health and beauty care, and pharmacy, which are sold through our Wholesale segment to wholesale customers and through Supervalu-operated retail stores to shoppers. We offer natural, organic and specialty foods and non-food products, consisting of national, regional and private label brands grouped into six product categories: grocery and general merchandise; produce; perishables and frozen foods; nutritional supplements and sports nutrition; bulk and foodservice products; and personal care items. Our branded product lines address certain needs of our customers, including providing a lower-cost label known as Field Day®.
Our private-label products include: the premium brands CULINARY CIRCLE® and STOCKMAN AND DAKOTA®, which offer unique, premium quality products in highly competitive areas; WILD HARVEST®, which is free from over 150 undesirable ingredients; core brands ESSENTIAL EVERYDAY®, EQUALINE®, SPRINGFIELD®, and category-specific brands ARCTIC SHORES SEAFOOD COMPANY®, BABY BASICS®, STONE RIDGE CREAMERY® and SUPER CHILL®, which provide shoppers quality national brand equivalent products at a competitive price; and the value brand SHOPPER’S VALUE®, which offers budget conscious consumer quality alternatives to national brands at substantial savings.
Our Professional Services Offerings
We offer a broad array of professional services that provide Wholesale customers with cost-effective and scalable solutions. These services include pass-through programs in which vendors provide services directly to our Wholesale customers, as well as services and solutions we develop and provide directly. Our services include retail store support, advertising, couponing, e-commerce, network and data hosting solutions, training and certifications classes, and administrative back-office solutions. The sales and operating results for these services are included within Wholesale.

Our Marketing Services
We offer a variety of marketing services designed to increase sales for our customers and suppliers, including consumer and trade marketing programs, as well as programs to support suppliers in understanding our markets. Trade and consumer marketing programs are supplier-sponsored programs that cater to a broad range of retail formats. These programs are designed to educate consumers, profile suppliers and increase sales for retailers, many of which do not have the resources necessary to conduct such marketing programs independently. Set forth below are the services offered by each to these programs:
Consumer Marketing Programs

• | Monthly, region-specific, consumer circular programs, with the participating retailers’ imprint featuring products sold by the retailer to its customers. We offer circular programs to our customers and vendors through negotiated pricing for the retailer, and also provide retailers with a physical flyer and shelf tags corresponding to each month’s promotions. We also offer a web-based tool, which retailers can use to produce highly customized circulars and other marketing materials for their stores called the Customized Marketing Program.


• | Truck advertising programs allow our suppliers to purchase advertising space on the sides of our hundreds of trailers traveling throughout the United States and Canada, increasing brand exposure to consumers.


• | Web and digital marketing services including websites, mobile apps, and e-Commerce capabilities.

Trade Marketing Programs

• | New item introduction programs showcase a supplier’s new items to retailers through trials and discounts.


• | Customer Portal Advertising allows our suppliers to advertise directly to retailers using the portal that many retailers use to order product and/or gather product information.


• | Foodservice options designed to support accounts in that category.


• | Monthly specials catalogs that highlight promotions and new product introductions.


• | Specialized catalogs for holiday and seasonal products.

Supplier Marketing Programs

• | ClearVue®, an information sharing program offered to a select group of suppliers designed to improve the transparency of information and drive efficiency within the supply chain. With the availability of in-depth data and tailored reporting tools, participants are able to reduce inventory balances while improving service levels.


• | Supply Chain by ClearVue®, an information sharing program designed to provide heightened transparency to suppliers through demand planning, forecasting and procurement insights. This program offers weekly and monthly reporting enabling suppliers to identify areas of sales growth while pinpointing specific opportunities for achieving greater profits.


• | Supplier-In-Site (SIS), an information-sharing website that helps our suppliers better understand the independents channel in order to generate mutually beneficial incremental sales in an efficient manner.


• | Growth incentive programs, supplier-focused high-level sales and marketing support for selected brands, which foster our partnership by building incremental, mutually profitable sales for suppliers and us.

Periodically, we conduct focus group sessions with certain key retailers and suppliers to ascertain their needs and allow us to better service them. We also provide our customers with:

• | trends reports in the natural and organic industry;


• | product data information such as best seller lists, store usage reports and catalogs;


• | assistance with store layout designs, new store design and equipment procurement;


• | planogramming, shelf and category management support;


• | in-store signage and promotional materials, and assistance with planning and setting up product displays;


• | shelf tags for products; and


• | a robust customer portal with product information, search and ordering capabilities, reports and publications.

Organic Certification
Our “Certified Organic Distributor” certification covers all of our broadline distribution centers in the United States, except for facilities acquired in connection with the acquisitions of Tony’s, Haddon, and Nor-Cal. Although not designated as a “Certified Organic Distributor” by QAI, the three Tony’s California locations are certified as Organic by the State of California Department of Public Health Food and Drug Branch, and Nor-Cal is currently registered with the California Department of Food and Agriculture Organic Program as an organic handler. In addition, our Canadian distribution centers in British Columbia and Ontario both hold one of the following organic distributor certifications: QAI, EcoCert Canada or ProCert Canada.
6

We maintain a comprehensive quality assurance program. All of the products we sell that are represented as “organic” are required to be certified as such by an independent third-party agency. We maintain current certification affidavits on most organic commodities and produce in order to verify the authenticity of the product. Most potential suppliers of organic products are required to provide such third-party certifications to us before they are approved as suppliers.
Working Capital
Normal operating fluctuations in working capital balances can result in changes to cash flow from operations presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows that are not necessarily indicative of long-term operating trends. Our working capital needs are generally greater during the months leading up to high sales periods, such as the build up in inventory during the time period leading to the calendar year-end holidays. We typically finance these working capital needs with funds provided by operating activities and available credit through our revolving credit facility.
Our Suppliers
We purchase our products from more than 9,000 suppliers. The majority of our suppliers are based in the United States and Canada, but we also source products from suppliers throughout Europe, Asia, Central America, South America, Africa and Australia. We believe suppliers of conventional, natural and organic products seek to distribute their products through us because we provide access to a large customer base across the United States and Canada, distribute the majority of the suppliers’ products and offer a wide variety of marketing programs to our customers to help sell the suppliers’ products. Substantially all product categories that we distribute are available from a number of suppliers and, therefore, we are not dependent on any single source of supply for any product category. In addition, although we have exclusive distribution arrangements and support programs with several suppliers, none of our suppliers accounted for more than 5% of our total purchases in fiscal 2019. 
We have positioned ourselves as one of the largest purchasers of organically grown bulk products in the natural and organic products industry by centralizing our purchase of nuts, seeds, grains, flours and dried foods. As a result, we are able to negotiate purchases from suppliers on the basis of volume and other considerations that may include discounted pricing or prompt payment discounts. Furthermore, some of our purchase arrangements include the right of return to the supplier with respect to products that we do not sell in a certain period of time. Each region is responsible for placing its own orders and can select the products that it believes will most appeal to its customers, although each region is able to participate in our company-wide purchasing programs. 
Our Distribution Systems
The sites for our distribution centers are chosen to provide direct access to our regional markets. This proximity allows us to reduce our transportation costs relative to those of our competitors that seek to service these customers from locations that are often several hundred miles away. We believe that we incur lower inbound freight expense than our regional competitors because our scale allows us to buy full and partial truckloads of products. Products are delivered to our distribution centers primarily by our fleet of leased trucks, contract carriers and the suppliers themselves. When financially advantageous, we pick up product from suppliers or satellite staging facilities and return it to our distribution centers using our own trucks. Additionally, we generally can redistribute overstocks and inventory imbalances between our distribution centers if needed, which helps to reduce out-of-stocks and to sell perishable products prior to their expiration date.
The majority of our trucks are leased from a variety of national banks and are maintained by third-party national leasing companies, which in some cases maintain facilities on our premises for the maintenance and service of these vehicles. We also have facilities where we operate our own maintenance shops.
We ship certain orders for supplements or for items that are destined for areas outside of regular delivery routes through independent carriers. Deliveries to areas outside the continental United States and Canada are typically shipped by ocean-going containers on a weekly basis.

Our Focus on Technology
We have made significant investments in distribution, financial, information and warehouse management systems. We continually evaluate and upgrade our management information systems at our regional operations in an effort to make the systems more efficient, cost-effective and responsive to customer needs. These systems include functionality in radio frequency inventory control, pick-to-voice systems, pick-to-light systems, computer-assisted order processing and slot locater/retrieval assignment systems. At most of our receiving docks, warehouse associates attach computer-generated, preprinted locater tags to inbound products. These tags contain the expiration date, locations, quantity, lot number and other information about the products in bar code format. Customer returns are processed by scanning the UPC bar codes. We also employ a management information system that enables us to lower our inbound transportation costs by making optimum use of our own fleet of trucks or by consolidating deliveries into full truckloads. Orders from multiple suppliers and multiple distribution centers are consolidated into single truckloads for efficient use of available vehicle capacity. In addition, we utilize route efficiency software that assists us in developing the most efficient routes for our outbound trucks. As part of our “one company” approach, we are in the process of converting to a single national warehouse management and procurement system to integrate our existing facilities, including acquired Supervalu facilities, onto one nationalized platform across the organization. We continue to be focused on the automation of our new or expanded distribution centers that are at different stages of construction and implementation. These steps and others are intended to promote operational efficiencies and improve operating expenses as a percentage of net sales.
Competition
The food distribution industry is highly competitive. Our largest competition comes from direct distribution, whereby a customer reaches a product volume level that justifies distribution directly from the manufacturer in order to obtain a lower price. We compete on the basis of price, quality, assortment, schedule and reliability of deliveries and services, value-added services, service fees and distribution facility locations. We also compete in the United States and Canada with numerous national, regional, and local distributors of grocery and non-grocery consumable products. The strategic acquisition of Supervalu provided us with greater scale, a broader product assortment, and a suite of professional services that enhance our ability to compete. Our customers also compete with online retailers and distributors that seek to sell products directly to customers. Recent and ongoing consolidation within the grocery industry has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased competition, including from some competitors that have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us.
Government Regulation
Our operations and many of the products that we distribute in the United States are subject to regulation by state and local health departments, the USDA and the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), which generally impose standards for product quality and sanitation and are responsible for the administration of bioterrorism legislation. In the United States, our facilities generally are inspected at least once annually by state or federal authorities. For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations promulgated by the USDA to interpret and implement these statutory provisions. The USDA imposes standards for product safety, quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program.
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), expanded food safety requirements and FDA food safety authorities and, among other things, requires that the FDA impose comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply chain, further regulates food products imported into the United States, and provides the FDA with mandatory recall authority. The FSMA requires the FDA to undertake numerous rulemakings and to issue numerous guidance documents, as well as reports, plans, standards, notices, and other tasks. 
The Surface Transportation Board and the Federal Highway Administration regulate our trucking operations. In addition, interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the United States Department of Transportation and other relevant federal and state agencies. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations.
Many of our facilities in the United States and in Canada are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater.  Further, many of our distribution facilities have ammonia-based refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel, hydrogen fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks.  Moreover, in some of our facilities we, or third parties with whom we contract, perform vehicle maintenance. Our policy is to comply with all applicable environmental and safety legal requirements.  We are subject to other federal, state, provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials; however, these provisions do not materially impact the use or operation of our facilities.

Employees
As of August 3, 2019, we had approximately 19,000 full and part-time employees within continuing operations, 4,800 of whom (approximately 25%) are covered by 46 collective bargaining agreements, including agreements under renegotiation. We have in the past been the focus of union-organizing efforts, and we believe it is likely that we will be the focus of similar efforts in the future.
In December 2018, the National Labor Relations Board certified the election results of our driver and warehouse employees in Vernon, California to be represented by the Teamsters union. We are in the process of negotiating collective bargaining agreements with these employees. 
Seasonality
Generally, we do not experience any material seasonality. However, our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to factors such as changes in our operating expenses, management’s ability to execute our operating and growth strategies, personnel changes, demand for our products, supply shortages and general economic conditions.
