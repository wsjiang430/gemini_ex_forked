Item 1. Business



Nauticus is a developer of ocean robots, autonomy software, and services delivered to the marine industries. Nauticus was initially incorporated as Houston Mechatronics, Inc. on March 27, 2014, in the State of Texas. Nauticus is transforming from a business where revenue was primarily generated through engineering service contracts, with both government and commercial customers, to a company that performs subsea robotic services through various technology-based products. Nauticus’ products and services will be primarily delivered to commercial and government-facing customers through a Robotics as a Service (“RaaS”) business model and direct product sales for both hardware platforms and software licenses. Besides a standalone service offering and forward-facing products, Nauticus’ approach to ocean robotics has also resulted in the development of a range of technology products for retrofit/upgrading legacy systems and other third-party vehicle platforms. Nauticus’ services provide customers with the necessary data collection, analytics, and subsea manipulation capabilities to support and maintain assets while reducing their operational footprint, operating cost, and greenhouse gas emissions, to improve offshore health, safety, and environmental exposure.



The RaaS revenue model emulates the Software as a Service (“SaaS”) revenue model, which is commonly used for consumer and business software licensing, but extends the model to include robots. In the SaaS model, the end user pays a fixed fee for a set period of time in order to use of the software. In the case of Nauticus’ RaaS model, clients will be charged a flat fee for performing the service over a period of time as required to complete the task. This fixed fee supports full use of Aquanaut, Hydronaut, ToolKITT, the communication infrastructure, and the personnel required to support the servicing mission. The RaaS fee approach encompasses the complete technology stack that is required to complete the contracted work. This can be contrasted with the industry’s current commercial approach, which bills clients based on the individual elements for performing the servicing mission (e.g., an itemized invoice for deployment of the equipment, tooling, crew, boat fuel, vessel, etc.). With the RaaS model, a flat rate, currently estimated to be $30,000-$50,000/day, will be billed to cover all equipment and personnel required to perform the service, irrespective of exactly which tasks are being performed. In Nauticus’ RaaS model, the subscriber pays for the service and not the rolled-up costs individually, as is frequently done today via an a la carte menu fashion. All other costs are covered in the subscription fee, including the long-term maintenance and servicing of the robots. At this stage, Nauticus proposes the use of a RaaS business model for delivering services to commercial clients only.



In contrast to the other robotics systems, Argonaut is handled differently and does not currently fall under the RaaS business model. The client base for Argonaut purchases the platform outright. There is longer-term service revenue associated with each platform around maintenance and add-on enhancements and payloads.



Nauticus’ near-term objective is to disrupt the current ocean services paradigm through the introduction and integration of advanced robotic technologies. These key technologies are supervised autonomy control software, novel robotic platforms capable of implementing autonomous behaviors, acoustic communications networking protocols, force/torque controllable electric manipulation, perception, artificial intelligence and machine learning software, and multimodal 3-D workspace sensors. Implementation of these technologies enables substantially improved operations at significantly reduced costs and greenhouse gas emissions over conventional methods based on the size of legacy surface support vessels, their crew, and required communications and power links. Legacy surface support vessels are typically 75-meter vessels, requiring a large crew and substantial equipment. Further, using a tethered remotely operated vehicle (“ROV”), the surface support vessel must support large spools of communication and power cable that can link the surface to the ROV, for example, down to 3,000m. This outfit can cost upwards of $100,000 per day, based on the size of the crew and the cost of the surface support vessel and equipment. In comparison, Nauticus’ cost estimates, which it validated through testing of the Hydronaut and Aquanaut, show that these costs can be reduced significantly when the full complement of Nauticus technologies are deployed. This is because the cost to outfit and hire the vessel are reduced, as Hydronaut is an 18-meter vessel, requiring fewer crew and resources. And the reduced crew and vessel size lead to large reductions in greenhouse gases emitted during these operations. Further, because the Aquanaut is an untethered ROV, it does not require the amounts of communication and power cables that a tethered ROV requires, reducing the cost of operations.



Products, Services and Revenue:



Nauticus is in an industry that operates on a service-based daily rate model, often with very lengthy master service agreements. These master service agreements can span from two to four years, or more, for each device dedicated to one customer, resulting in low utilization per asset. Nauticus differentiates itself by employing a more opportunistic view which expands across different customers for shorter periods of time, thus facilitating higher utilization rates.



However, similar to the current service model, our RaaS business model (planned for future commercial services but yet to be implemented) is characterized by a recurring revenue stream granted in exchange for services provided, in this case through usage of our Nauticus robotic vehicles. The RaaS model should be considered within a range of revenue models that have this recurring characteristic. The RaaS model, as described in this prospectus, covers a range of conventional service contracts through an ongoing contract to provide services in a local area. As Nauticus deploys its initial service fleet, we anticipate that the initial services will be paid through conventional contracting methods, directly with the customer or in regional partnerships with an in-country service entity.





1







These conventional contracting methods typically revolve around a long-term master service agreement (MSA) with an end client and service company. As a go-to-market strategy, Nauticus Robotics aligned interests with regional partners (e.g., Stinger Technology AS in Norway) to offer this conventional method within already awarded frame agreements. This allows Nauticus Robotics to shorten the adoption time of the service technology solution to an end client without having the end client fully adopt the entire RaaS model. There is, however, nothing that would prevent the end client from contracting directly with Nauticus Robotics under the RaaS offering. This use of the conventional contracting method does not exclude the providing of such services through the RaaS business model. Nonetheless, this conventional contracting method provides a quicker alternative if the RaaS business model is initially undesirable — a prominent reason being that the current contract is not up for rebid until much later. This allows Nauticus Robotics to provide its technology and enables the client to access it sooner. This in turn also allows Nauticus Robotics to rapidly expand into new regions, since it will use the in-country facilities and business resources of the regional partner.



Nauticus’ RaaS business model accommodates this type of contracting mechanism. However, as the new service paradigm matures and this technology is utilized by more customers, increased fleet assets will create a network effect in specific market regions (e.g., the North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, etc.). These assets will provide a continuous virtual residency of vehicles that serve the customer base. This ‘residency’ of available assets will enable a new approach to services at a further reduced cost, as customers share the operational overhead of supporting this new type of service infrastructure through ongoing subscription-based contracting.



The RaaS business model will be applied to the commercial fleet services aspect of our business. These services will be deployed through various RaaS contracting mechanisms as the market requires. The ToolKITT software platform is intended to be licensed on a SaaS basis or, in some cases, sold to end customers through a perpetual license. In the latter case, end users will be contracted for software support and maintenance. New versions and upgrades will be sold to customers set to retain the recurring revenue nature of the SaaS/RaaS model.



Although the sale of Nauticus’ products may occur on either point sales or RaaS/SaaS models, the fleet services and software (“ToolKITT”) are targeted for this type of recurring revenue sales. Other products such as Argonaut (US Defense) and Olympic Arms (for existing ROVs) are anticipated to be sold through conventional sales contracts with accompanying software licenses. Aquanaut, the commercial subsea vehicle, may also be sold to selective customers, when those sales are not expected to cannibalize or compete with other Nauticus fleet services.



To date, Nauticus has generated revenue through U.S. defense contracts utilizing Aquanaut, Hydronaut, Argonaut, ToolKITT and commercial contracts for engineering services and vehicle leasing. The Argonaut has completed final assembly in our facility and is has undergone commissioning testing in the Pacific Ocean, leading to its acceptance by the customer, a Large Confidential Government Contractor, for further use in US government applications. Nauticus intends to continue to support the U.S. Department of Defense as a contract performer, both on its own and with a Large Confidential Government Contractor. These contracts support further technology development for Nauticus and further opportunities to migrate aspects of this work to the commercial sector. Both Nauticus and our partner, a Large Confidential Government Contractor, plan to actively pursue sales and services in the U.S. defense and intelligence communities through the Argonaut vehicle.



Currently, Nauticus has not completed any material product sales, and many of its core products are still under development. Nauticus provided service and support for HaloGuard products, a red zone monitoring solution. As of June 2022, Nauticus Robotics Holdings and Transocean negotiated an end to Nauticus Robotics Holdings’ support on the product line in order to focus more on the mainline revenue generating items for Nauticus Robotics Holdings.



The RaaS model is anticipated to commence in late 2023 or 2024 with the Hydronaut and Aquanaut units currently under construction at the expected market rate of $30,000-$50,000 per day. Since the vehicles will have limited calendar space to generate revenue in 2023, the RaaS service model is expected to account for just a small portion of 2023 revenues.



Evolution of Aquatic Robotics



The modern ocean robotic vehicles known as unmanned underwater vehicles (“UUVs”) can be traced to work performed by the U.S. Navy in the 1960’s. As this technology developed through the 1970’s and 1980’s, the oil and gas industry began to utilize this technology to support exploration projects in water depths that exceeded the capability of human divers. Since these beginnings, remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles (“AUVs”) have expanded their reach into many fields beyond the ocean energy marketplace. These robotic vehicles have played a key role in exploration and discovery as well as ocean rescue missions. Today, these vehicles are routinely used to perform a wide variety of tasks in support of many fields of use, including offshore wind energy and aquaculture.



UUVs generally have two missions: data gathering or manipulation. They are operated in two distinct classifications — remotely operated or autonomous. The current vehicle designs are optimized and limited to performing one mission or the other. The long-range observation and data gathering missions are often oceanographic data, communication cable inspections, or subsea topographical surveys. These vehicles are usually AUVs and are non-hovering, tetherless, ’submarine shaped’ hulls optimized for long range cruising. Not only do these platforms neglect any manipulation, they are also less than ideally suited for tasks requiring high maneuverability. There are some hovering AUVs and even some that offer limited manipulation. However, these hydraulic arms are very rudimentary add-on features incapable of complex coordination or more advanced concepts like goal directed, impedance-force control.





2







On the other hand, most manipulation missions are performed by ROV designs. These tethered robots, which are specifically aimed at subsea manipulation, are attached to topside support vessels for power and communication. As such, they take advantage of high data rates and the power-rich environment afforded by the tether. Although operator fatigue is a notorious problem, most ROV operators are paid by the hour, and that has unfortunately held down advancing the state of the art in operational efficiency, control, and manipulation sophistication. And it is these exact technological advancements that are required in a communication-poor, power-limited environment.



There is an emerging need for the hybrid operation: a highly maneuverable platform that can perform manipulation work and also travel efficiently for tens of kilometers. This might include deployment from shore or from some other vehicle and then traveling large distances to then perform manipulation or observation work or both.



Market Opportunity



Although AUV and ROV technology have progressed over the years, the fundamental solution architecture has not changed from its beginning. Servicing missions at depth requires a large surface ship and for intervention tasks, tether spooling systems to be mounted and controlled from the vessel. Beyond the obvious mobilization/demobilization and operating costs of the ship, the tether system introduces its own set of operational challenges and constraints to account for entanglement and sea current-induced disturbances. The size and complexity of the tether system contribute to the size requirements of the vessel. The current paradigm typically includes onboard crew to operate the ROV, further increasing the vessel requirements. The current architecture drives the high cost of this service through the large size of the surface vessel combined with the encumbrance of the connecting cable between the surface vessel and the ROV.



The Nauticus solution addresses the primary factors that drive the cost of the current servicing paradigm. Eliminating the need for the several thousand meters of cable and therefore the onsite vessel and people using acoustic communications substantially reduces the cost of operations. In addition to removing the cost and maintenance of the cable, the surface vessel does not need to accommodate the size and complexity of this system, reducing its size and associated cost. Reducing the size of the surface vessel yields cost savings through reduced crew and vessel operating cost. Importantly, reducing the size of the surface vessel also substantially reduces the carbon expression during servicing operations.



Removing the cable, which provides high-bandwidth communications between the surface and the ROV, while still performing dexterous manipulation tasks has been a central technical achievement of Nauticus. Increasing the autonomy of the ROV through artificial intelligence enables the full set of capabilities required by the market but achieved through low-bandwidth data links. In this new control paradigm, high-bandwidth teleoperation gives way to low-bandwidth supervised autonomy. Taking the responsibility for robotic interventions from a real-time operator and placing it with the robot itself also improves performance of the system by reducing task completion times. This benefit results when the robot, not the operator, compensates for local disturbances while completing tasks in the workspace.



Another key benefit provided by Nauticus’ Aquanaut is its unique ability to transform its hull to optimize performance during different phases of the mission. The AUV-style, hydrodynamically efficient hull configuration enables the robot to traverse long distances when performing subsea pipe or cable inspections. After this transit, the vehicle can transform its shape to expose workclass-capable manipulators to interact with its environment. This ability to transit long distances and then perform manipulation tasks is enabled by both the vehicle design as well as the freedom from a cabled surface connection. This unique capability of the Aquanaut brings new capacity to subsea robotic interventions and further disrupts the status quo.



Nauticus believes that these new technical advances will redefine how ocean intervention services are performed. However, it is possible that these beliefs will prove incorrect. For additional discussion of risks relating to operational and financial projections, please see “Risk Factors — Our operating and financial projections rely on management assumptions and analyses. If these assumptions or analyses prove to be incorrect, our actual operating results may be materially different from its forecasted results.”



The new and unique capabilities of the Aquanaut represent a significant market opportunity for Nauticus to disrupt the ocean services marketplace, especially given the lack of comparable systems.



The market for this technology is vast and covers several independent market segments including offshore renewables, oil & gas, telecommunications, aquaculture, mining, defense, ports, and shipping, just to name a few. The worldwide energy (O&G & Wind) IMR services market is projected to grow based on aging assets with O&G, and asset growth with Offshore Windfarms.Over the next 4 years, there will be tremendous growth of wind farm infrastructure installed into the global offshore market. Currently, 25GW of offshore renewables are installed off the coast of Europe with expectations to double by 2030. The Biden administration announced the installation of 30GW of offshore renewables to be installed off American shores by 2030. In total, this would imply around 15,000 more wind turbines to be installed in just the United States and Europe. Today, these markets are served by service companies offering Vessel-based services with the cost of these services being split substantially on the cost to operate the vessel over the ROV.

Overall, the Defense market is expected to perform strongly in the next 5 years as geopolitical tensions continue to indicate that peer competitor and near-peer competitor engagements are likely in the ocean domain. Unmanned systems, especially in the maritime domain, will be front and center and see heavy investment. Due to the inherent stealth that the undersea domain presents, we believe this area will see a sharp increase in development spending and acquisitions. In general, geopolitical tension drives defense spending for reconnaissance and covert littoral battlefield and deepwater assets such as Argonaut, and agencies that sponsor these developments have affirmed this belief. COVID-19 has had a minimal effect on defense spending on our products. We have seen some increase in discretionary spending even while COVID-19 has caused a decrease in government spending in other areas. We do not expect a reduction in spending from supporting agencies.



The use of technology like Aquanaut is a significant topic in port security and management but is difficult to properly assess through industry reports alone. Our findings through target customer interactions indicate that the size of the port and security market and expected adoption of such technology in the next three to five years will be substantial. As a point of reference, there are over 100 major ports worldwide and where Aquanaut can address the work required to assess port seabed conditions, vessel hull anomalies, sensor placements and retrievals, change detection monitoring and unauthorized vessel detection. We plan to have multiple service offerings for the port and harbor security market through vehicle sales and leases to the customer, including all equipment necessary to conduct Aquanaut missions. This will lead to Autonomy- as- a- Service, using the ToolKITT and behavior development license agreements for our customer base. Aquanaut is an excellent multi-tool, but many of the ‘tools’ required for the vehicle are software based. Due to the specific nature of security requests, we believe that custom development will be a requirement. We plan to provide over-the-air updates from our Houston-based engineering team to ensure that vehicles are equipped and qualified with the latest alogrithms in our autonomy framework. We believe we will have a residual revenue opportunity through a long-term license for the autonomy updates.



A longer-term market where Nauticus could expand is Aquaculture, and that segment is expected to increase significantly. With the world’s population on course to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, the global demand for protein is expected to grow by 40%. One way to meet our protein needs is to sustainably maintain both wild fish reserves and farmed fish. Furthermore, the rising trend of smart fishing and the increase in seafood trade is also propelling the demand for aquaculture products. Major factors driving the growth of the market include rising demand for protein-rich aqua food across the world, rapid adoption of advanced technologies — IoT, artificial intelligence (“AI”), feeding robots, and underwater remotely operated vehicles on aquaculture farms; increasing investment and rising R&D expenditure in aquaculture technology worldwide; and the growing popularity of land-based recirculating aquaculture systems.



The most addressable portion of this market today is associated with salmon farming in both Norway and Chile. Regular net cleaning is important to maintaining the health of the fish and the current man in the loop semi-automated cleaners damage the netting over time and nets break. When the nets break, the fish are lost, but the farmers are also fined for allowing farm fish to escape into the wild population of fish. Aquanaut-type vehicles and Aquanaut technologies could reside within the farm and clean the nets more regularly. The robot could also use its machine vision technology to measure and classify the net wear characteristics over time, which would trigger preventative maintenance in order to avoid net breaks, and by doing so, avoid the fine.



The Nauticus Solution



We are developing a portfolio of ocean robotic vehicles and manipulators controlled by our multi-layered software suite. This software provides sensed perception of the environment combined with guidance, navigation, and control of the vehicle. Additionally, the software suite provides cutting-edge intelligence to control the dual arm manipulators to perform dexterous tasks. Complex task execution without a high-bandwidth tether to the robot necessitates a command-and-control architecture that permits local command authority as well as a level of self-sufficiency to execute high-level, human-directed tasks. Many studies have demonstrated that naive implementation of autonomy can result in opaque systems—meaning that it is difficult to explain their outcomes—unless a focus of the system architecture is the interdependence between human and robotic systems. Besides basing our success metrics on operator mental burden, advances in three key areas will differentiate this architecture. Those areas are automatic task planning, probabilistic-based perception, and novel data compression.



Our technological innovations also include:




● | A subsea vehicle that can transform its hull shape from a hydrodynamic transit vehicle to a working ROV mode that exposes two workclass manipulators
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A multi-layered software subsystem that handles vehicle control, perception, and manipulation supported through machine learning paradigms
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An acoustic-based mesh network communication system that provides multi-point communication capabilities between multiple subsea vehicles and the sea surface

We believe the primary drivers towards the adoption of Nauticus’ products include:




● | Substantial reduction in the cost to deliver subsea inspection, maintenance, and repair services to customers
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced carbon footprint provided by the reduction in size of the surface vessels required to perform work
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced number of crew exposed to offshore work hazards
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | Additional cost savings from fewer vessel days due to improved operational efficiencies
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduction of hydraulic fluid leaks
--+-----------------------------------




We believe the benefits of our robotic systems will have clear implications across many industries, including offshore wind, port security, aquaculture, traditional energy, subsea mining, and telecommunications.



Strategic Collaborators



We collaborate with market leaders in complementary technologies such as energy storage and sensors while nurturing market relationships with key customers. Our collaborations with high-profile industry leaders provide valuable feedback that we believe will enhance our early mover advantage. We also expect that these relationships will provide us enhanced credibility and better lead generation and conversion of additional potential customers.
Growth Strategy



The key elements of our growth strategy include:



Accelerate the Development of our Robotic Systems



Nauticus is committed to the development of a complete ocean eco-system of robotic technologies. Each product is developed from an advanced automation perspective with focus on increased performance, lower cost, and environmentally friendly operations. The Nauticus product portfolio includes a new archetype of subsea vehicle, the AURV we call Aquanaut, that can change its configuration to optimize performance during various transit and manipulation phases of the mission. Our expertise in dexterous manipulation supports the deployment of electric, subsea manipulators that will be used by Nauticus for its own vehicles, but may also address a market need to retrofit existing ROV’s with manipulators that have both workclass strength and reach envelopes. ToolKITT integrates total robot and vehicle functions that simplify operational control through ‘mouse clicks’, not joysticks. This superior approach to operational control of robots reduces both task times and mission cost. The Nauticus acoustic communication technology serves as a many-to-many data connection between multiple mobile assets in the marine environment. This technology enables multiple robotic actors to participate in complex servicing activities with over-the-horizon control by remote operators. These products combine to minimize mission execution cost, enhance safety, and enable the application of state-of-the-art robotic technologies to the needs of the ocean customer.
Continued Investment in Innovation



We will continue to invest significant resources in developing proprietary technologies across hardware, firmware, software, and controls to commercialize our robotic systems. We expect our research and development activities to focus on various sizes of vehicles and manipulators to meet different market needs. Improving network data communication to include both acoustic and optical modalities that optimize bandwidth over the near and far range is also a part of the development roadmap.
Our Product Platforms



We expect to offer a range of robotic systems that draw on our intellectual property, years of expertise, and innovative core technologies.



Aquanaut



The Aquanaut represents a new type of subsea vehicle that takes advantage of new subsystem technologies to bring best-in-class performance to the ocean realm.



We believe the following to be the key capabilities of the Aquanaut:




● | Transformable hull design that enables efficient operations in transit (AUV mode) and at the worksite (ROV mode)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | All-electric design for both propulsion and manipulation
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Capable of operating under supervised autonomy and fully autonomous vehicle control modes
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Multi-modal sensor suite capable of creating a high resolution 3-D map of the near-space environment to support manipulation
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Onboard navigation that enables extended transit to a worksite
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

Argonaut 



Argonaut is a derivative of the Aquanaut vehicle Argonaut, which has enhanced capabilities for transit and autonomous operations. This vehicle has been orchestrated to provide Nauticus’ government-facing customers with the capabilities to perform their specialized mission scenarios. The Argonaut has completed final assembly in our facility and has undergone commissioning testing in the Pacific Ocean, leading to its acceptance by the customer, a large confidential government contractor (a “Large Confidential Government Contractor”), for further use in U.S. government applications. Specifically, this vehicle will be used by a Large Confidential Government Contractor, in conjunction with Nauticus, to perform under a current contract. This product and other variants are currently available for direct sales to U.S. Department of Defense entities or contractors and will be available in the future for commercial services through a RaaS contract for ongoing services.
Hydronaut



An 18m-long, optionally crewed vessel that will support the real-time operations of Aquanaut in commercial applications. Hydronaut will ferry Aquanaut to and from the worksite and support battery recharging and the over-the-horizon communication link to shore.



ToolKITT



ToolKITT is a cloud software platform consisting of interrelated products for ocean sensing, manipulation, autonomous behaviors, survey, search & recovery, and manual intervention. This functionality encompasses robotic controls, user interfaces, sensor integration, simulation, data analysis, and communication frameworks purposely built to enable work subsea. This software unifies all of Nauticus’ products into a single control architecture. This system includes a communications middleware that orchestrates vehicle activities, performs updates, and enables multi-agent interaction and mission planning. However, the software platform can also be used across other robotic platforms in the ocean space and, theoretically, outside of the ocean domain as well.



This product embodies a complete command and control suite of software components that provide the intelligence necessary to transit and perform work with minimal interventions. Although the entire suite is comprised of the following components, each one is capable of existing independently, being seamlessly integrated into existing customer platforms and systems:




● | Helmsman — Safe, efficient, reactive, on-board control system for maritime robotic platforms
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Commander — Mission planning, autonomy, and direct commanding of maritime robotic platforms
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Wayfinder — Perception-based mapping and world modelling
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Wavelink — Disruption-tolerant, secure, communication network for maritime robotic platforms
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Loggerhead — Data collection and analysis for customer data products and diagnostics
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition



Current Solutions:



Ocean Services utilizing AUVs/ROVs are based on vessel companies contracting two ways with clients — Long Term Annual Contracts and Spot Market Contracts. For ROV Vessels, the price can range from $40K/day to $100K/day depending upon specification of vessel with ROVs at $8K/day to $10K/day. These vessel companies either own their own fleet of AUV/ROVs or they subcontract with an AUV/ROV services providers. The mobilization and demobilization costs of the equipment are an additional service fee the majority of the time. AUVs are utilized within the market differently than ROVs with smaller survey vessels used that do not have crane systems or DP2 position control classification. These types of vessels will cost up to $60K/day with the AUV related costs being between $10 – $20K/day.

Drawbacks to the current business model:



Contracting is based on discrete services being rendered, and value gets converted into a day rate. There is an emphasis on how the job is done and not what job is done, and it is billable accordingly. For example, the entire work process is broken down into steps and phases and the service contactor bills for each step. There are mobilization costs, trip costs, stand by costs, actual onsite costs, costs for tooling, demobilization costs, etc.



Customers and Partners



Nauticus is actively engaged in the development of specialized ocean vehicles for U.S. government interests. In this work, we are teaming with a Large Confidential Government Contractor to deliver ocean vehicles that meet the challenging objectives of the U.S. Services. In the past we have been funded directly by DARPA to develop our advanced ocean capabilities, and currently, we are partnered with a major defense prime to deliver a classified system that leverages that technology.



For the go-to-market strategy in commercial ocean services, Nauticus has teamed with local service providers in the North Sea to leverage their relationships with customers operating in this active region for ocean energy services. Through our investment relationships with both Transocean and Schlumberger, we have in place a global footprint of opportunities to pursue and an infrastructure that can be leveraged to expedite service deployments.



Customers



Nauticus currently has developed two models of subsea robots — Aquanaut and Argonaut. The vehicles both exhibit the ability to traverse long distances, transform their hull to expose dual robotic manipulators, perform robotic tasks, and then return to the launch site or other predetermined location. The Aquanaut is designed to meet commercial requirements related to performing inspection, maintenance, and repair work in subsea oil & gas and offshore wind energy applications. Its capabilities could also satisfy the needs for port security and maintenance, aquaculture, telecommunications, and subsea mining markets. In this setting, the vehicle performs a variety of tasks, including inspection, maintenance, and repair of customer assets. The Argonaut is designed for a different mission set that is driven by the needs of the U.S. Department of Defense. The Argonaut is distinguished from the Aquanaut in several ways, but most importantly, this vehicle is capable of extended range during transit. Other distinguishing features include a different sensor complement and improved autonomous behaviors. Nauticus has created two separate vehicles for two important markets in order to allow each vehicle to evolve to meet the requirements of its respective market. But more importantly, the Argonaut contains technology that makes it International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) restricted whereas the Aquanaut does not contain such technology. The initial Aquanaut commercial unit is planned to be delivered in the second quarter of 2023. The two remaining Aquanauts are to be delivered in the second and third quarters of 2023. Nauticus has executed nonexclusive Memorandums of Understanding (“MOU”) with Norwegian operators, Ramfjord Technologies and Stinger Technology, to pursue opportunities in the region. The company also plans to pursue direct contracting opportunities in the North Sea.

In addition, Transocean, Inc., the world leader in offshore drilling for oil exploration and production, has been an invested partner with Nauticus since 2018. Opportunities to deploy Aquanauts off Transocean drilling rigs have already been extensively discussed between Nauticus and Transocean.



The first Argonaut is in testing for potential full acceptance in 2023 by a Large Confidential Government Contractor. The Argonaut is outfitted with special sensors and equipment to support its deployment on specialized missions for various U.S. agencies.



Nauticus has also developed a full-featured software stack, called ToolKITT, that provides autonomous and semi-autonomous control modes covering all aspects of subsea vehicle missions. This software, although indigenous to Nauticus’ own subsea vehicles, can also be deployed in existing ROV’s to enhance and expand their operational capabilities. This software is currently showcased in the Defense Innovative Unit contract as the intelligent machine driving the VideoRay Defender ROV. At the conclusion of this contract, if Nauticus meets all the program objectives, it is envisioned that Nauticus will have the opportunity to deploy this software system under license to the U.S. Navy for use on their existing Defender ROVs.



Manufacturing and Suppliers



As part of the original development of engineering prototypes, Nauticus has established supplier relationships with key commercial-off-the-shelf (“COTS”) and custom part manufacturers. Consideration is given within our international supply chain for redundancy, where possible. In cases of limited supplier options, Nauticus initiates procurement early in the manufacturing schedule to mitigate risk of supply interruption.



Currently, Nauticus manages a supply chain with many suppliers that specialize in parts aimed toward subsea vehicles. A shared and key component of Aquanaut and Argonaut subsea vehicles is the energy storage system — a Li-ion battery. There are a variety of suppliers available to provide this battery subsystem. One battery, in particular, that Nauticus uses is from SubCTech, a German company. The batteries are a long-lead-time item and are ordered well in advance of the time they are required to be integrated into the vehicle. A copy of the most recent SubCTech battery contract is included as Exhibit 10.20. However, there are alternative batteries (although not direct replacement and would require integration work e.g., Kracken), and Nauticus is not necessarily dependent on SubCTech. In the most extreme event that battery suppliers are unable to produce battery packs for Nauticus, Nauticus could resort to pulling that subsystem vertical and producing batteries for the subsea vehicles in house. Nauticus has tremendous battery design, manufacturing, and assembly expertise, and former NASA energy systems division experts are on staff.



For parts and fabricated components, Nauticus is using an outsourced manufacturing strategy to fabricate Aquanauts (subsea vehicle) and Hydronauts (optionally crewed surface vessel). This strategy reduces in-house manufacturing and allows Nauticus to perform the final integration and functional acceptance test of the Aquanaut prior to shipping. Two (2) Hydronauts are under construction with Diverse Marine in the United Kingdom, and three (3) Aquanauts are being fabricated by with International Submarine Engineering in Canada. Copies of the contracts are included here as Exhibits 10.21 and 10.22, respectively.



Nauticus also has a purchase contract with iXBlue (France) to purchase a Drix unmanned surface vessel. This vessel also pairs with the subsea Aquanaut as a communications node in place of the Hydronaut. A copy of the contract is included here as Exhibit 10.23.



As we progress toward more production of our ocean vehicles, trade studies will be conducted to identify subassembly outsourcing options that will reduce the number of parts required in-house for final assembly at our facility. We recognize that the outsourcing trades may have advantages in limiting required lease space, tooling, and personnel requirements, but these benefits may be offset by quality control or other issues leading to full in-house assembly of the vehicles. Nauticus is committed to exploring the options that will lead to the most capital-efficient manufacturing process and support our sales-driven build schedule.



Government Regulation



In addition to our compliance regarding federal regulations affecting businesses of this type, Nauticus also maintains compliance with the ITAR and Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) governing the sale of our technology products. In addition to these commercial regulations, compliance with the U.S. Department of Defense requirements for safeguarding data and other sensitive information is a main focus of the organization.
Intellectual Property



The ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection through patent and trademark filings is important to our business. Nauticus utilizes a combination of the protections afforded to the owners of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademarks to secure its intellectual property. In addition, Nauticus requires employment agreements which stipulate IP protections for the company. For external relationships, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual restrictions are used to establish and protect our intellectual property.

Nauticus will file for patent protection if the invention is believed to be patentable and the resulting patent will be beneficial in protecting the invention in the marketplaces. Consideration is also given, particularly with respect to software, as to the benefits of seeking a patent against the associated market risks of providing public exposure of the invention. In many cases with our software, Nauticus holds this code and algorithms as trade secrets.



Nauticus has patented its reconfigurable hull design for subsea vehicles. This approach protects the Company’s vehicle configuration that enables it to transit long distances and then transform into a working robot once at the worksite. This capability is key to exploiting the vehicle architecture and its tetherless operational modes. Similarly, Nauticus has applied for patent protection for its all-electric, workclass robotic manipulators. These manipulators are the first in their market class and utilize specialized actuation systems to achieve the strength performance necessary for workclass systems. This patent was granted on January 24, 2023 under USPTO Number 11559905.



Nauticus has also filed for protection of our Company name and brand under trademark registration in the United States.



Legal Proceedings



Nauticus is not engaged in any legal proceedings and there is no legal action anticipated by the company.



Employees



We had 93 employees as of December 31, 2022, including our named executive officers. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages related to labor relations issues. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
Merger Agreement



On the Closing Date, Nauticus consummated its previously announced Business Combination pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as amended, by and among Nauticus’ predecessor CleanTech, Merger Sub and Nauticus Robotics Holdings. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination was effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Nauticus Robotics Holdings, with Nauticus Robotics Holdings surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of CleanTech. On the Closing Date, CleanTech was renamed “Nauticus Robotics, Inc.,” and Nauticus Robotics Holdings was renamed “Nauticus Robotics Holdings, Inc.”



As a result of the Closing, among other things, (a) each share of Nauticus Robotics Holdings preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing converted into Old Nauticus Common Stock, in accordance with the certificate of incorporation of Nauticus Robotics Holdings (the “Preferred Stock Conversion”); (b) each of the Old Nauticus Convertible Notes was converted into shares of Old Nauticus Common Stock in accordance with the terms of each such note (the “Convertible Note Conversion”); and (c) each share of Old Nauticus Common Stock (including shares of Old Nauticus Common Stock outstanding as a result of the Preferred Stock Conversion and Convertible Notes Conversion, but excluding shares of the holders who perfected rights of appraisal under Delaware law) was converted into the right to receive (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration and (ii) Earnout Shares.



In addition, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Old Nauticus Common Stock (an “Old Nauticus Option”), whether or not then vested and exercisable, was assumed by CLAQ and converted automatically (and without any required action on the part of such holder of outstanding Old Nauticus Option) into an option to purchase shares of the CLAQ’s Common Stock equal to the number of shares determined by multiplying the number of shares of the Old Nauticus Common Stock subject to such Old Nauticus Option immediately prior to the Closing by the Exchange Ratio. As a result of the Closing, an aggregate of 3,970,266 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon exercise of these options.



Earnout Shares. 



Following the closing of the Merger, former holders of shares of Old Nauticus Common Stock (including shares received as a result of the Preferred Stock Conversion and the Convertible Notes Conversion, the “Stockholder Earnout Group”) shall be entitled to receive their pro rata share of up to 7,499,993 additional shares of Common Stock (the “Earnout Shares”). The Earnout Shares will be released and delivered to the Stockholder Earnout Group upon occurrence of the following (each, a “Triggering Event”):

i. | one-half of the Earnout Shares will be released if, within a 5-year period following the signing date of the Merger Agreement, the volume-weighted average price of our Common Stock equals or exceeds $15.00 per share over any 20 trading days within a 30-day trading period;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii. | one-quarter of the Earnout Shares will be released if, within a 5-year period following the signing date of the Merger Agreement, the volume-weighted average price of our Common Stock equals or exceeds $17.50 per share over any 20 trading days within a 30-day trading period; and

Subscription Agreements. In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, CleanTech entered into subscription agreements (collectively, the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain parties subscribing for shares of Common Stock (the “Subscribers”) pursuant to which the Subscribers purchased, and CleanTech agreed to sell to the Subscribers, an aggregate of 3,100,000 shares of Common Stock, for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $31 million (the “Equity Financing”). Of the Subscribers, Transocean Inc. and Material Impact II, L.P. respectively purchased 750,000 and 250,000 shares of Common Stock in the Equity financing at a price of $10.00 per share and at aggregate respective purchase prices of $7,500,000 and $2,500,000.
Securities Purchase Agreement. In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Nauticus and Nauticus Robotics Holdings entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement with certain investors purchasing up to an aggregate of $40.0 million in principal amount of Debentures and warrants (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”). The number of shares of Common Stock into which the Debentures are convertible is equal to 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Debentures divided by the conversion price of $15.00, and the number of shares of Common Stock into which the associated warrants are exercisable is equal to 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Debentures divided by the conversion price, with an exercise price equal to $20, subject to adjustment (the “Debt Financing,” and together with the Equity Financing, the “PIPE Investment”). The exercise price of the associated warrant is subject to (i) customary anti-dilution adjustments; and (ii) in the case of a subsequent equity sale at a per share price below the exercise price, the exercise price of the associated warrant will be adjusted to such lower price, and the number of shares underlying the warrant will increase proportionately. In the event of a rights offering or dividend, the warrant holder will be treated as though the shares underlying the warrant he/she holds were outstanding. These warrants can be exercised on a cashless basis. There is an original issue discount of 2% from the issued amount of the Debentures. Interest accrues on all outstanding principal amount of the Debentures at 5% per annum, payable quarterly. The Debentures are secured by first priority interests, and liens on, all present and after-acquired assets of the Company and will mature on the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance. ATW, Material Impact Fund II, L.P., and the SLS Family Trust have subscribed for Debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $36,530,320 (out of the aggregate $40.0 million) which is convertible into 2,922,425 shares of our Common Stock and associated warrants for an additional 2,922,425 shares. ATW is managed by ATW Partners Opportunities Management, LLC, which is an affiliate of Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (“Chardan”), and our former director, Mr. Jonas Grossman, is the Managing Partner and President of Chardan. In addition, our director, Adam Sharkawy, is the managing partner of Material Impact II, L.P.
