  In 2019, we decided to shift our focus so that our business will be mainly engaged in the sale of medicines and other health-related commodities through the development of a marketing network. We intend to focus on sales of prescription drugs, explore new retail opportunities (in addition to the acquisition of Boqi Pharmacy), and enter new rural areas. Through the expansion of pharmacy stores, acquisitions of businesses in the medical industry and franchise development, we intend to continue to build core competencies such as specialized services. We are committed to the pharmaceutical retail industry and to transforming the company into a technology-driven health service platform. We also intend to continue to actively explore domestic and international financing opportunities.
 Products and Services
 At present, our products and services include:
 •        Providing large-diameter smart flow control devices for China’s electric power generation, water supply, heating supply and gas supply industries.
 •        Providing the equipment related to desulfurization, denitration and dust removal for China’s electric power generation, metallurgy, petrochemical, steel, cement and heating supply industries.
 •        Providing consulting services, such as energy efficiency optimization design, energy consuming equipment retrofit and engineering, equipment maintenance and services, energy management based on Energy Performance Contracts for China’s industrial enterprises.
 In 2019, we plan to expand our products and services into the healthcare industry, providing both Chinese and Western medicines, as well as Chinese herbal medicines, health equipment, health foods, general foods, personal care products and daily necessities.
 Production and Sales of Energy Saving Flow Control Equipment
 Our current principal business is the production and sales of energy-saving flow control equipment and intelligent flow control equipment. This business accounts for the majority of the Company’s current revenues.
 The transportation of water, gas, oil, and heat to end users is dependent on various kinds of pipelines and pipe networks. In the case of water pipelines, such systems are also used for public health and safety, and waste and flood control.
 We believe that he key to conserve energy and provide for an efficient pipeline transportation process is the valve and the flow control equipment. Having unique technology in this field, the Company has obtained four patents and holds fourteen utilization model patents in China for flow control devices, especially in the area of the bidirectional seal zero revelation installation system with its special characteristics. Using valves of this type can result in a 20% reduction in energy consumption for customers compared to traditional valves. The reduced energy consumption thereby increases the efficiency of the pipeline system. It is widely used in the fields of electric power, hydro power, petroleum, and natural gas. The Company’s super intelligent flow-control device was awarded “Number One Energy Saving Valve of China” by the Chinese Energy Conservation Association. Our products are exported to the United States, Russia, Turkey, Italy, Bulgaria, South Korea, Vietnam, India, Thailand, South Africa, Iraq, and Afghanistan.
 Another main business is the energy saving technology engineering and service, the Company intends to continue to develop comprehensive energy conservation and energy reduction equipment and services, and to pursue research development and improved manufacturing of flow control and clean energy related equipment.
Healthcare Products
 We plan to expand our operations and focus on becoming a provider of healthcare products. We intend to build up a professional team to take advantage of the market and investment opportunities in China. In April 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Boqi Pharmacy. Our plans, subject to obtaining additional financing, also include increasing our investment in medical services and scaling up our recently acquired medical business. At the same time, we intend to follow the group company operation mode and seek new medical service acquisition opportunities with respect to general hospitals, specialist hospitals, specialist chain stores and third-party medical centers in areas such as the Bohai Bay Economic Zone and the Yangtze River Delta in China.

  Patents and Technology
 Nengfa Energy currently has been issued four invention patents and has applied for fourteen utility model patents in the PRC. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on the confidentiality of our operations, proprietary know-how and business secrets. Although we do not have formal agreements with our employees, we do consider our employees’ work to be proprietary and owned by the Company. Where necessary, we will take steps to protect our intellectual property interests under the laws of the PRC. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce our rights if they are improperly taken by our employees or adopted by our competitors outside of sanctioned use and royalty agreements with the Company.
 Certain of our service offerings will not be patentable or otherwise be capable of being registered as intellectual property. Therefore, the Company will rely solely on such services being proprietary. As such the Company will have to rely on the services being more advanced or better than its competitors’ offerings or rely on trade secret laws and protections. Such protections in the PRC are considered rather weak and are difficult if not impossible to enforce. Consequently, it may be possible for our competitors to obtain our information and to copy, adopt or adapt our methods, services and technical aspects to their own business with no assurance that we will be able to prevent them from using the intellectual property in competition with us.
 We do not have any significant trademarks in use at this time. As our business develops, we will consider the advantage of developing specific trademarks for our products and services and may register those marks with the PRC government authorities for trademark protection.
 Markets and Customers
 The transport of water and fluid energy, such as oil, gas, steam and hot water depends on pipelines. The intelligent flow control devices supplied by NF Energy are an important part in the fluid energy transportation systems. According to “one belt and road initiative”, China plans to invest 4 trillion yuan in the next 5 to 10 years into water conservancy projects, the average annual investment is 400 billion yuan, and the investment relating to valves is approximately 40 billion yuan per year. Since it was founded in 2006, the Company has supplied its products to many projects of this national water works, including the middle and northern Guangxi Xijiang River Water Diversion Project, Shenzhen Water Supply Project, Shanghai Water Diversion Project, and the 7 urban water supply projects in Liaoning Province, three curved water diversion projects in Dandong, and other major domestic water diversion projects. We believe that we have the best industry performance in water supply projects so as to be awarded as “king of butterfly valve” in water diversion industry. At the same time, we also provide flow control devices and equipment for supercritical thermal power plants and ultra-supercritical coal-fired power plants as well as domestic hydro power generation market which are dominated by China’s state-owned five big power groups. More than 80% of the Company’s annual revenues come from these markets and customers.
 In connection with its work on the water diversion project and some of the power plant projects, the Company has a preferred provider agreement with Nengfa Weiye Tieling Valve Joint Stock Co., Ltd. (“Tieling Valve”) under which Nengfa Energy is the preferred provider of the valves and other related flow control equipment that Tieling Valve requires in its own work on the water diversion project. The agreement is in the manner of a right of first refusal whereby Tieling Valve is obliged to offer supply opportunities to Nengfa Energy within its scope of product offerings and expertise, but Tieling Valve is not prohibited from developing other supply arrangements. Tieling Valve and Nengfa Energy have agreed to cooperate to develop and market their respective technologies, equipment, products and services for their respective and mutual benefit, and will work together to examine and expand their respective businesses. Under the agreement, each party retains full right to their respective intellectual property. The agreement terminates in 2021, but by its terms will automatically extend for additional one year terms unless notice of termination is given by one party to the other at least six months prior to the then termination date.
 We intend to operate in the pharmaceutical market upon our acquisition of Boqi Pharmacy. According to the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics, in 2018, the per capita consumption expenditure of the national residents was RMB 19,853 yuan. After deducting the price factor, the actual increase was 6.2%, an increase of 0.8 percentage points over the same period of the previous year. From the perspective of the service consumption structure of residents, the per capita medical expenditure on healthcare was RMB1,685 yuan, an increase of 16.1%. In terms of population structure, the aging population continues to deepen. The proportion of people aged 65 and over has increased by 0.5 percentage points. Affected by factors such as expansion and population migration, the proportion of urban population in China

  increased by 1.06 percentage points from the end of 2017, an increase of RMB 17.9 million. Benefiting from the increasing demand for medical consumption of residents, the aging of the population, the effect of the “two-child” policy, and the steady improvement of urbanization, the demand for consumer medicine is still stable, laying a solid foundation for continued growth of the pharmaceutical industry.
 With the gradual advancement of medicines, prescription outflows will become another major driver of the development of the retail pharmacy industry. The “Notice on Printing and Distributing the 13th Five-Year Plan for Deepening the Reform of the Medical and Health System” (Guo Fa [2016] No. 78) states: “To promote the separation of medical treatment and medicines, medical institutions should prescribe according to the generic name of the drug and take the initiative to provide to the patients, do not limit the outflow of prescriptions. Exploring the multi-channel drug purchasing mode of outpatients in hospitals, patients can purchase drugs from retail pharmacies by prescription.
 We believe that adjusting the market structure will make retail pharmacies an important channel for drug sales and pharmaceutical services to patients. In the entire pharmaceutical industry chain, retail pharmacies connect the upstream pharmaceutical preparation production department and downstream patients. We further believe that the growth opportunities expected from increased prescriptions will become a driving force for the development of the retail pharmacy industry.
 Currently, the top 100 pharmaceutical retailers in China accounts for 30.8% of the total retail market. This is far below the target set in the Chinese government’s “13th Five-Year Plan”, which forecasts “the annual sales of top 100 pharmaceutical retail operators will account for more than 40% of the total retail sales market”. The top ten retail companies accounted for only 16.8% of the market share, far below the development level of the pharmaceutical market in the US and Japan. In 2017, the number of chain pharmacy companies decreased by 200 compared with 2016. The growth rate of chain enterprises has been negative in the past three years. In 2015-2017, the number of stores in the top 100 and top 10 chain pharmacies accounted for more than gradually climbing. Drawing on the development process of foreign retail pharmacies, the increase in concentration generally occurs after the separation of medicines. China’s pharmaceutical separation reform has been fully launched since 2015, the concentration of retail pharmacy industry has increased rapidly, the speed of mergers and acquisitions of listed companies has accelerated, and the regional integration effect has gradually been reflected, showing a trend of relying on strong and leading enterprises to be strong.
 Boqi Pharmacy’s marketing and sales strategy also relies on the use of exclusive agents throughout China who act as marketing agents and after sale service providers. Boqi Pharmacy currently has 23 exclusive distributing agents national wide. At certain times each year, Boqi Pharmacy provides and organizes training sessions for these agents and their personnel. These sessions provide Boqi Pharmacy with a valuable opportunity to gather feedback and to foster an exchange of technical ideas.
 Raw Materials
 The major raw materials for our production of our flow control devices are stainless steel, steel, copper and rubber parts. We source our materials locally in China. Nengfa Energy is located in Liaoning Province which is China’s largest production base for iron and steel. We have stable long term supply arrangements for our principal raw material suppliers based on long standing business relationships. Since we are located close to the suppliers of many of our essential raw materials, we believe that we enjoy price and transportation cost advantages over our competitors and competing users. Through our advanced technology and our management of raw materials, we believe that we are able to manage and improve our consumption rates of the raw materials we use in production, which results in lower operating expense and extension of our inventories.
 Boqi Pharmacy’s pharmaceutical and medical device suppliers mainly include national large-scale pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing companies and wholesale pharmaceutical companies. Among the national large-scale pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing suppliers are Shanghai Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd., China Pharmaceutical Group Corporation, Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Tianjin Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Shandong Dong’e Ejiao Group Co., Ltd., Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. and other large pharmaceutical companies. Among the wholesale pharmaceutical companies are China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation, China Resources Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Shanghai pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Jointown Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Nanjing Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd and other mega wholesalers of drug and medical devices.

  Regulatory Compliance
 The Company’s products are subject to regulatory standards and enforcement codes which typically require that these products meet stringent performance criteria. Standards are established by industry testing and certification organizations such as the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (A.S.M.E.), the Canadian Standards Association (C.S.A.), the Japanese Standards Association (J.S.A.), the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (I.A.P.M.O.), Factory Mutual (F.M.), and Underwriters Laboratory (U.L.). These standards are incorporated into state and municipal plumbing and heating, building and fire protection codes in China.
 We maintain stringent quality control and testing procedures at our manufacturing facility in order to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements. Our production management is certified to conform to the ISO 9001 standards by the Det Norske Veritas Management System.
 According to the “Administrative Measures for Pharmaceutical Business Licenses” and other relevant regulations in China, we will need to obtain qualification certificates for the Operations of the company, its subsidiaries and the pharmacy stores. The qualification certificates mainly include the “Quality Management Certificate for Pharmaceutical Administration” (GSP Certificate), “Pharmaceutical Business License”, “Food Business License”, “Medical Device Business License”, “Medical Agency Practice License”, etc.
 The pharmacy stores directly operated by Boqi Pharmacy have all obtained the “Pharmaceutical Business License” and the “Pharmaceutical Management Quality Management Certificate”. At the same time, 30 stores have obtained the “Internet Drug Information Service Qualification Certificate” and 25 stores have obtained the “Medical Device Network Sales Record”. These business qualifications have been renewed or renewed in a timely manner according to the relevant laws and regulations.
 Seasonality
 Our management believes that our operations are not currently subject to seasonal influences.
 Competition
 The Company believes it holds a leading position in the super diameter energy efficient flow control system market in China. The Company has an extensive competitive advantage over Chinese domestic manufactures in this field. Other manufactures that are focusing on the development of different and smaller valve products may enter this field. Our major potential competitor in this field is China Valve Technology.
 In the other areas of the Company’s business, there are many different competitors with differing focuses and strengths. To some extent, boilers and furnaces are specialized to particular industries and output requirements. This specialization engenders specialization in the design, manufacture and installation of new equipment and retrofit solutions. Therefore, there are many engineering and manufacturing companies that focus on certain types of boilers and furnaces resulting in a relatively fragmented market for these services. The same is true for the retrofit and reconstruction of other industrial systems for improved energy efficiency, as well as for the localized projects for energy conservation and biomass utilization, and similar projects. Therefore, the competition that the Company faces tends to be localized companies with no dominant players at this time.
 Boqi Pharmacy is one of the pharmaceutical retailers with a wide distribution network in China. As of December 31, 2018, its marketing network covered 9 provincial markets and nearly 20 prefecture-level cities (urban areas). In 65% of the region, Boqi Pharmacy has established a well-developed online and offline distribution network and a more efficient logistics system in the relevant regions. At the same time, it has strengthened its market share in the terminal market through the combination of endogenous growth and outreach mergers and acquisitions. In recent years, the number of company stores has maintained an annual growth rate of nearly 30%.
 We plan to compete based on our ability to address a wide spectrum of solutions in our various market areas. We believe our competitive advantages result from our patented technologies, our strategic relationships with engineering companies, our marketing and our business relationships. We plan to continue to expand these aspects of our business to further grow our core businesses and provide solutions for the energy savings and green energy projects. We intend to participate actively in the government sponsored projects and government contracting.
