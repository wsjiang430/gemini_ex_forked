Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities with a primary focus on pruritus as well as pain by selectively targeting peripheral kappa opioid receptors. We are developing a novel and proprietary class of product candidates, led by KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin), a first-in-class kappa opioid receptor agonist that targets the body’s peripheral nervous system, as well as certain immune cells. 
 
In Phase 2 trials, KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection (intravenous formulation) has demonstrated statistically significant reductions in itch intensity and concomitant improvement in pruritus-related quality of life measures in hemodialysis patients with moderate-to-severe CKD-aP, and is currently being investigated in Phase 3 trials in hemodialysis patients with CKD-aP. We have partnered with VFMCRP, a joint venture between Vifor Pharma Group and Fresenius Medical Care, to commercialize KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection in dialysis patients with CKD-aP worldwide, excluding the United States, Japan (Maruishi/sub-licensee Kissei), and South Korea (CKDP). We retain all rights in the United States and will promote KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection, if approved, with VFMCRP in U.S. Fresenius Medical Care North America, or FMCNA, dialysis clinics under a profit share agreement. 
 
CR845/difelikefalin has also demonstrated statistically significant pain reduction in clinical trials in patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain in the post-operative setting, without inducing many of the undesirable side effects typically associated with currently available opioid pain therapeutics. We retain rights to all KORSUVA/CR845 formulations and indications worldwide, excluding KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection in dialysis patients with CKD-aP under our agreement with VFMCRP for certain ex-U.S. territories and our other license agreements for CR845/difelikefalin in Japan (Maruishi/sub-licensee Kissei) and South Korea (CKDP).  
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has conditionally accepted KORSUVA as the trade name for CR845/difelikefalin injection and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.
 We commenced operations in 2004, and our primary activities to date have been organizing and staffing our company, developing our product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of CR845/difelikefalin-based product candidates and raising capital. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity and debt securities and payments from license agreements. We have no products currently available for sale, and substantially all of our revenue to date has been revenue from license agreements, although we have received nominal amounts of revenue under research grants.

The Market Opportunity – Pruritus
 
Pruritus, or itch, is defined as an unpleasant sensation that provokes the desire to scratch. Certain systemic diseases have been known to cause pruritus that ranges in intensity from a mild annoyance to an intractable, disabling condition. Itch originates in the epidermis and dermal–epidermal junction and is transmitted by itch-selective sensory neuron C fibers, or pruriceptors. Some of these fibers are sensitive to histamine while others are not, and there is evidence for histamine-insensitive C fibers that are activated by numerous itch-inducing substances or pruritogens, many of which initiate signals through interaction with specific G-protein-coupled receptors.  In addition, there is increasing evidence for the differential involvement of these systems in various forms of itch which may involve disease-specific pruritogens. As an example, chronic pruritus associated with kidney failure is thought to involve complex interactions among peripheral cells (T cells, mast cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and keratinocytes) and histamine-insensitive nerve fibers, involving increased release of cytokines, proteases, and neuropeptides, interacting with multiple receptors that lead to exacerbation of itch. These different peripheral cell types express kappa opioid receptors, which can regulate the release of these pruritogenic substances, while the kappa opioid receptors on C fibers are thought to regulate their response to these pruritogens. Because kappa opioid receptors are expressed in peripheral tissues, there is a potential to modulate itch signals peripherally without impacting the central kappa opioid receptors. The itch-sensitive sensory nerve fibers transmit signals to the cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia (that also have kappa opioid receptors), which send fibers to enter the spinal cord. Itch signals then ascend via the spinothalamic tract to multiple brain areas for sensory processing and interactions with cognitive and other systems.  
 
Additionally, the activation of kappa receptors via an agonist is thought to reduce itching by functionally counteracting increased mu opioid receptor activity which is suggested to be associated with some chronic forms of pruritus. Activation of the mu opioid receptor in the brain and in the peripheral nerve endings results in itching while non-selective mu opioid antagonists can inhibit itching. Kappa opioid receptor stimulation inhibits the effects of mu receptor activation both centrally and peripherally. 
 Pruritus may be classified into different categories on the basis of the underlying causative disease: renal or chronic kidney disease associated pruritus or CKD-aP (previously known as uremic pruritus), cholestatic pruritus, dermatological pruritus, hematologic pruritus, endocrine pruritus, pruritus related to malignancy and idiopathic generalized pruritus.  According to a study we conducted with IMS Health (now IQVIA) utilizing medical claims data from 2013, approximately 21 million patients received a prescription for an anti-pruritic agent such as corticosteroids, antihistamines, select antidepressants, counterirritants, bile acid sequestrants, rifampin, narcotic antagonists and partial agonists, topical immunomodulators or gabapentin. 
 Chronic Kidney Disease-Associated Pruritus (CKD-aP)
 
CKD-aP (also known as uremic pruritus) can occur in patients with chronic kidney disease, or CKD, as well as End Stage Renal Disease, or ESRD, and is commonly seen in patients receiving hemodialysis.  According to Fresenius Medical Care, a world leading provider of products and medical care for dialysis patients, there were approximately 3.2 million patients globally undergoing dialysis in 2017.  According to the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, or DOPPS, published in December 2017 in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrologists, it is estimated that nearly 70% of these patients suffer from some form of CKD-aP with approximately 40% of these patients experiencing moderate to severe pruritus.

Currently, there are no approved products in the United States or Europe to treat CKD-aP.  Patients are generally managed with a multitude of products including corticosteroids, gabapentin, antihistamines, antidepressants and others with varying degrees of success. There is one product, nalfurafine (Remitch®) marketed by Toray Industries, approved to treat CKD-aP in Japan only.  It is not approved either in the United States or Europe for CKD-aP. 
 
Other Causes of Pruritus
 There are many other systemic diseases that can trigger pruritus in patients.  They include cholestatic liver disease, endocrinologic disease (e.g. hyperthyroidism), malignancy (e.g. Hodgkin lymphoma), hematologic disease (e.g. polycythemia vera), atopic dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, hives/urticarial, and lice/scabies.  Data from a Cara-sponsored IMS Health (now IQVIA) study, utilizing medical claims data from 2013, indicate that over 20 million prescriptions for anti-pruritic therapeutics are filled annually in the United States.   
The Market Opportunity – Pain and Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) Management
 
Pain is generally categorized by its duration as either acute or chronic, by its severity, as either mild, moderate or severe, and its type and/or causality, such as postoperative or neuropathic. Acute pain is typically caused by an injury resulting in nerve, tissue or bone damage and is expected to subside in severity when the injury heals. Postoperative pain is a subset of the acute pain market. According to the International Association for the Study of Pain, more than 46 million inpatient and 53 million outpatient surgeries are performed annually in the United States. PONV is another significant issue for many patients in the postoperative setting occurring in over 30% of patients.
 
Chronic pain, on the other hand, is prolonged, and can be the long-term result of an acute injury or an ongoing disease condition, such as neuropathic pain associated with diabetes. According to an Institute of Medicine report, chronic pain affects approximately 100 million U.S. adults, while millions of others experience acute pain caused by events such as surgery, injury, childbirth and illness. The most common causes of moderate-to-severe chronic pain are musculoskeletal problems and inflammatory conditions. Injuries from accidents resulting in fractures, dislocations or soft tissue injury, as well as lower back pain, are the most frequent causes of musculoskeletal pain. Although these injuries are mostly non-fatal, the cost in terms of long-term disability, medical expense and lost productivity is large. 
 
Post-Operative Pain and Chronic Pain Markets
 According to IQVIA, the total U.S. market for pain management pharmaceuticals was $45.3 billion in 2018. The prescription pain management market in the United States is still dominated by opioid analgesics, which, according to IQVIA data, represented 52% of the 368 million analgesic prescriptions written in 2018 and accounted for sales of $5.7 billion in that year. Opioid analgesics decrease the perception of pain by stimulating mu, delta and/or kappa opioid receptors. All of these receptors are involved in modulating pain signals. The most widely used opioid analgesics, including hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, and fentanyl, act primarily through the activation of mu opioid receptors in the CNS. However, because of the wide distribution of mu opioid receptors throughout the brain, morphine and other mu opioid analgesics also trigger a characteristic pattern of adverse “central” side effects, including nausea and vomiting, itching and respiratory depression. Mu opioids are also known to cause euphoria, which can lead to misuse, abuse and addiction issues.   
 Moderate-to-severe chronic pain is typically treated with prescription products including immediate release and long-acting opioids, such as the branded products OxyContin® (oxycodone), NUCYNTA® ER (tapentadol) and Opana® ER (oxymorphone), and combination products that include an opioid combined with an NSAID or acetaminophen, such as the branded products Vicodin® (hydrocodone and acetaminophen) and Percocet® (oxycodone and acetaminophen). Prescription products for chronic pain are usually in oral tablet or capsule form because the vast majority of these patients are taking these medications outside of the hospital setting.

Despite the size of the pain management market, there has been little innovation in the development of new analgesics, with nearly all recent new drug approvals limited to reformulations and improved methods of delivery of existing therapeutics. Mu opioids continue to be the most prescribed drugs for pain management, despite their side effects and the potential for misuse, abuse and addiction. These concerns often cause healthcare providers to administer or prescribe less than optimal doses of mu opioids, or patients to take lower than prescribed doses, resulting in inadequate pain relief. Consequently, we believe that the pain market represents a therapeutic area with substantial unmet needs for patients in pain, for physicians who must balance pain control with risks of causing severe adverse events, and for healthcare organizations that bear the costs of managing the consequences of undertreated pain and drug-related adverse events. We believe that CR845/difelikefalin, with its novel mechanism of action, will likely be attractive to patients and physicians, as well as hospitals and payers, as a treatment for moderate-to-severe pain because of its ability to provide pain relief without opioid-related adverse events or abuse and addiction issues associated with currently approved mu opioid analgesics.
 
PONV Market 
 
PONV in a hospital or other medical setting in the United States is most often treated with 5-HT3 antagonists (e.g. ondansetron), NK-1 receptor antagonists (e.g. aprepitant) steroids (dexamethasone), dopamine receptor antagonists (haloperidol, metoclopramide) as well as Anticholinergics (scopolamine patch) either alone in low risk patients or in combination in patients with a higher risk of PONV. According to an article published in Best Practice & Research Clinical Anaesthesiology, PONV is one of the most important factors in determining length of stay after surgery, resulting in estimated annual costs in the United States in the range of $1 billion. Per IQVIA, in 2017, there were over 700 million units of PONV drugs sold in the United States.
 
The market for the prevention and treatment of PONV is highly fragmented. Anesthesiologists utilize a number of different agents alone or in combination (particularly in patients with a high risk for PONV) with different mechanism of actions to try to manage PONV. If approved, I.V. CR845/difelikefalin would likely be competing within the overall PONV market, although we expect that it would primarily be utilized as an add-on therapy in patients with a higher risk of PONV.  Although most of the PONV products are generically available, there is still a significant segment of high-risk patients where their PONV is not adequately managed, which can increase the hospital length of stay and add significant cost to managing a post-operative patient.  
 
Our Strategy  
 
Our strategy is to develop and commercialize a novel and first-in-class portfolio of peripherally-acting kappa opioid receptor agonists, with KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection and Oral KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) as our lead candidates. We have designed and are developing product candidates which have clearly defined clinical development programs and target significant commercial market opportunities. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
 
Advance KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection for the treatment of moderate-to-severe CKD-aP in patients undergoing hemodialysis to support regulatory approval. In January 2018, based on positive data from our earlier Phase 2 studies, we initiated the first pivotal Phase 3 trial (KALM-1) of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection in hemodialysis, or HD, patients suffering from moderate to severe CKD-aP. In January 2019, we completed enrollment in this trial and expect top-line data to read out in the second quarter of 2019. In August 2018, we initiated a global Phase 3 study (KALM-2) with KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection in HD patients with CKD-aP in multiple countries worldwide, including the United States. We expect top-line data from the global study to read out in the second half of 2019. In addition, we also have a 52-week single arm safety study ongoing in the United States that has currently over 100 patients that have completed at least 6 months of treatment. These studies will support filings for regulatory approval in the United States and other non-U.S. markets. In June, 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection for the treatment of CKD-aP in HD patients, for which there are currently no approved therapies in the United States. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation was in part supported by positive data from our previous Phase 2 efficacy studies. In March 2017, we reported positive Phase 2 data from a trial of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection in HD patients with CKD-aP where patients receiving KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) experienced a highly statistically significant reduction in worst itch scores as well as statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements 
 6
 

in quality of life measures versus placebo after eight weeks of treatment. KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) was observed to be well tolerated, with no significant drug-related events. Earlier, in July 2015, we reported similar positive top-line safety and efficacy results from a smaller Phase 2 trial in HD patients with CKD-aP after two weeks of treatment.  

Build a specialty sales and marketing organization to commercialize KORSUVA (CR845/ difelikefalin) injection for the treatment of CKD-aP in HD patients in the United States, if approved. If KORSUVA (CR845/ difelikefalin) injection is approved by the FDA for the treatment of CKD-aP in HD patients, we expect to establish a sales force to market to nephrologists in dialysis centers across the United States. We also intend to build a supportive commercialization organization as well as establish a reimbursement strategy and infrastructure to support our sales and marketing efforts. We do not intend to commercialize KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection for CKD-aP in HD patients on our own outside the United States. In May 2018, we licensed worldwide rights, excluding the United States, Japan and South Korea, to commercialize KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection for the treatment CKD-aP in dialysis patients to VFMCRP, a joint company of Vifor Pharma Group (SIX: VIFN) and Fresenius Medical Care (NYSE: FMS) that specializes in treatments for CKD. Under the agreement, VFMCRP has the exclusive rights to commercialize KORSUVA injection for the treatment of CKD-aP in dialysis patients in all countries outside the United States except in Japan and South Korea. We retain full development and commercialization rights for KORSUVA injection for the treatment of CKD-aP in the United States except in the dialysis clinics of Fresenius Medical Care North America (FMCNA), where we and VFMCRP will promote KORSUVA injection under a profit-sharing arrangement based on net FMCNA clinic sales recorded by us. In addition, we already have development and commercialization agreements with Maruishi and CKDP for development of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) for the Japanese and South Korean markets, respectively. 
 
Expand the use of Oral KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) in other pruritic indications by establishing proof-of-concept in clinical conditions such as non-dialysis stage III-V CKD-aP, chronic liver disease associated pruritus, or CLD-aP, and certain dermatologic conditions.  Based on potent anti-pruritic effect we observed with KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection in CKD-aP in hemodialysis patients as well as the data we and others have generated in preclinical models of itch, we have initiated clinical programs with Oral KORSUVA for the treatment of pruritus in patients with stage III to V (moderate to severe) CKD as well as in patients with CLD-aP. In July 2018, we initiated a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study with Oral KORSUVA in stage III to V (moderate-to-severe) CKD patients with CKD-aP. The Oral KORSUVA doses selected in the Phase 2 study were based on drug exposure data from the Phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetic, or PK, study with Oral KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) in patients with stage III to V (moderate-to-severe) CKD. We also conducted a Phase 1 safety/ tolerability and PK study in patients with CLD due to various underlying etiologies to support an efficacy proof-of-concept Phase 2 study in similar patients with CLD-aP. In addition, we also expect to initiate a Phase 2 trial in certain dermatologic conditions, including atopic dermatitis, with Oral KORSUVA around mid-year 2019.
 
Establish partnerships for further development and commercialization of I.V. CR845/difelikefalin for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain and/or PONV in acute care settings in the United States. In June 2018, we reported positive top-line data from the adaptive Phase 2/3 post-operative pain trial of I.V. CR845/ difelikefalin in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries. At the higher dose of 1.0 mcg/kg dose, I.V. CR845/ difelikefalin demonstrated statistically significant reductions in pain intensity compared to placebo at all pre-specified post-operative assessment periods. Additionally, I.V. CR845 treatment resulted in statistically significant reductions in the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting over the 24-hour period post-surgery for both the lower and higher doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mcg/kg, respectively. We are currently assessing the best path forward for I.V. CR845/ difelikefalin in the post-operative acute care setting and expect to seek FDA input regarding PONV as a potential indication. We expect to seek partnerships for further development of I.V. CR845/ difelikefalin in the acute care setting.

Establish partnerships for further development and commercialization of Oral CR845/difelikefalin for chronic pain indications. We do not intend to further develop and commercialize Oral CR845/difelikefalin for chronic pain indications on our own and will likely seek partnerships and collaborations with companies that have development and commercialization expertise in chronic pain. In June 2017, we announced top-line results of Oral CR845/difelikefalin from the Phase 2b double blind placebo-controlled trial where three different doses (1, 2.5 and 5 mg twice daily) of CR845/difelikefalin were evaluated in patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis, or OA, of the hip or knee over an eight-week treatment period. While the study did not meet statistical significance in reduction in pain scores across all OA patients (OA of hip and knee), at the 5 mg twice daily dose, patients with OA of the hip experienced statistically significant reduction in mean weekly pain score.  
 
Our Product Candidates
 
Our lead product candidate, CR845/difelikefalin, is a new chemical entity, which is designed to selectively stimulate kappa, rather than mu, and delta opioid receptors outside of the CNS. CR845/difelikefalin has been designed with specific chemical characteristics to restrict its entry into the CNS and further limit its mechanism of action to kappa opioid receptors in the peripheral nervous system and on immune cells. In addition to the side effects associated with activation of mu opioid receptors in the CNS, activation of kappa receptors in the CNS is also known to result in some undesirable effects, including dysphoria. CR845/difelikefalin is designed to specifically target kappa receptors located on peripheral nervous system and certain immune cells that results in modulation of pain signals as well as relief from pruritus or itch associated with certain chronic diseases. Since CR845/difelikefalin is designed to modulate kappa receptor signals peripherally without any significant activation of opioid receptors in the CNS, it is generally not expected to produce the CNS-related side effects of mu opioid agonists (such as addiction and respiratory depression) or centrally-active kappa opioid agonists (such as dysphoria and hallucinations). CR845/difelikefalin has been administered to more than 2,000 human subjects in Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials as an I.V. infusion, rapid intravenous injection or oral capsule or tablet, and thus far has been observed to be generally well tolerated in multiple clinical trials.    
 Based on the non-clinical and clinical studies we have completed to date, we believe that CR845/difelikefalin, if approved, would be attractive to both patients and physicians as a treatment for moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with certain diseases such as CKD, CLD and dermatological disease as well as moderate-to-severe pain due to the following attributes:

KORSUVA (CR845/Difelikefalin) Injection for Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease-Associated Pruritus (CKD-aP) 
 
Pruritus, or itch, is associated with certain chronic conditions such as kidney disease, atopic dermatitis, eczema, liver disease and psoriasis. Based on KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin)’s effect on the peripheral nervous system and immune cells which result in anti-pruritic and anti-inflammatory effects in non-clinical models, we believe KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) has the potential to treat pruritus associated with multiple medical conditions.  
 
CKD-associated pruritus, or CKD-aP, also known as uremic pruritus, is an intractable systemic itch condition with high prevalence in patients with CKD for which there are no approved therapeutics in the United States or Europe. 
 
In the first quarter of 2018, we initiated the first pivotal Phase 3 efficacy trial of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection in the United States for the treatment of CKD-aP in patients undergoing hemodialysis. The enrollment in this study is now complete and we expect top-line data in the second quarter of 2019. In August 2018, we initiated a Global Phase 3 efficacy trial (with a 52-week open label extension phase) of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection that is expected to enroll patients in the United States and multiple countries outside the United States. In addition to the efficacy trials, we are also conducting a 52-week Phase 3 safety study of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection in hemodialysis patients with CKD-aP.

In June 2017, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection for the treatment of moderate-to-severe uremic pruritus in patients with CKD undergoing hemodialysis. This regulatory decision was supported by positive results from Phase 2 clinical trials of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection in hemodialysis patients with CKD-aP. Breakthrough therapy designation is granted to expedite the development and review process for new therapies addressing serious or life-threatening conditions, where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.
 KALMTM-1 and KALM-2 Phase 3 Efficacy Trials of KORSUVA (CR845/Difelikefalin) Injection
 In January 2018, we initiated the first Phase 3 efficacy trial (KALM-1) to support regulatory filings for the approval of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection. This U.S study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week treatment trial (with a 52-week open label extension phase) that is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 0.5 mcg/kg of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection to be administered three times per week after dialysis in 350 hemodialysis patients with moderate-to-severe pruritus (with a pre-specified interim assessment that allowed for expansion of the study to up to 500 patients, if needed). The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving at least a 3‑point improvement from baseline with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24‑hour worst itching intensity numeric rating scale, or NRS, score at week 12. Secondary endpoints of the Phase 3 trial include assessment of itch-related quality of life changes measured using self-assessment 5-D Itch and Skindex-10 scales, as well as the proportion of patients achieving at least 4-point improvement from baseline in weekly mean of the daily 24-hour worst itching NRS score at week 12 and patient global impression of change. In January 2019, we announced the completion of enrollment in KALM-1 Phase 3 trial after a pre-specified interim conditional power analysis conducted by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, that recommended no adjustment to the original trial size.  Over 350 hemodialysis patients with CKD-aP have been randomized across approximately 60 clinical sites in the United States and we expect to report top-line data in the second quarter of 2019. 
 In August 2018, we announced the dosing of the first patient in the second Phase 3 efficacy trial (KALM-2) that is matching in design and size to the KALM-1 trial and will facilitate regulatory filings worldwide. This second Phase 3 trial is designed to enroll hemodialysis patients with moderate-to-severe pruritus in the United States as well as in multiple countries in Europe and Asia Pacific. Based on current enrollment projections, we expect to report top-line data from the KALM-2 trial in the second half of 2019.
 Phase 3 Safety Trial of KORSUVA (CR845/Difelikefalin) Injection
 In the second quarter of 2017, we initiated a 52-week Phase 3 safety trial that is expected to enroll up
 to 240 hemodialysis patients with CKD-aP, including those who have completed prior Phase 2 trials of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection as well as patients who have not been previously exposed to CR845/difelikefalin. This open-label trial is evaluating the long-term safety of KORSUVA (CR845/ difelikefalin) injection at the dose of 0.5mcg/kg. The enrollment is nearing completion, with approximately 125 patients who have completed at least six months of treatment and approximately 40% of these patients have completed one year of treatment. 
 The design and dose selection for our Phase 3 trials are based on results of the previously completed Phase 2 trials of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection in hemodialysis patients with CKD-aP in consultation with the FDA as part of our End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA that was held in September 2017. 
 Phase 2/3 Adaptive Design Trial of KORSUVA (CR845/Difelikefalin) Injection in Dialysis Patients
 In June 2016, we initiated a two-part Phase 2/3 adaptive design trial of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection in dialysis patients suffering from moderate-to-severe uremic pruritus. In March 2017, we announced top-line data from the Phase 2 trial, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of three doses of intravenous KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection (0.5 mcg/kg, 1.0 mcg/kg and 1.5 mcg/kg) administered three times per week after dialysis over an eight-week treatment period in 174 patients with moderate-to-severe uremic pruritus.

The primary endpoint of this trial was the change from baseline of the mean worst itching score for week eight measured on a patient reported 24-hour worst itching intensity 11-point NRS scale. Patients receiving KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection experienced a 68% greater reduction from baseline in worst itch scores than those receiving placebo (p<0.0019). The secondary endpoints of this trial focused on itch-related quality of life measures assessed using the Skindex-10 scale, 5-D itch scale, sleep disturbance subscale and others. In addition to reduction of pruritus, patients experienced substantial improvement in multiple itch-related quality of life (Skindex-10, 5-D Itch scale) measures and sleep over two months of treatment. Additionally, in a post-hoc analysis, (1) 64% of the patients treated at the 0.5 mcg/kg dose experienced at least a 3‑point improvement from baseline with respect to the weekly mean NRS score versus 29% of patients on placebo (p<0.01), and (2) 51% of the patients treated at the 0.5 mcg/kg dose experienced at least a 4‑point improvement from baseline with respect to the weekly mean NRS score versus 24% of patients on placebo (p<0.05).
 Overall, KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) was observed to be generally well tolerated over the eight-week treatment period and the unblinded Drug Safety Monitoring Board did not raise any safety concerns during the course of the trial. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were somnolence, headache, dizziness, mental status changes, nausea and diarrhea, generally in line with what has been observed in previous clinical studies of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin). The Phase 3 part of this study has been replaced by the KALM-1 Phase 3 trial. 
 Phase 2 Efficacy Trial in Dialysis Patients
 In 2014, we conducted a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept trial (Part B), which measured the efficacy of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection at the dose of 1.0 mcg/kg compared to placebo in reducing the intensity of itch in 65 dialysis patients with uremic pruritus over a two-week dosing period, who had baseline "worst itching" scores of greater than 40 mm on a visual analog scale, or VAS ranging from 0 to 100 mm. In July 2015, we reported positive top-line efficacy results from this trial, in which we observed that KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection demonstrated statistically significant reduction in worst itch intensity as measured by VAS, the primary endpoint of the trial, as well as statistically significant improvement in quality of life measures such as Skindex-10, the trial’s secondary endpoint. The overall safety and tolerability profile was favorable. The dose of the Phase 2 study was informed by Phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetic, or PK, trial (Part A) that was conducted in subjects undergoing hemodialysis at doses ranging from 0.5 mcg/kg to 2.5 mcg/kg after each dialysis session up to three times per week.
 Oral KORSUVA (CR845/Difelikefalin) for Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease-Associated Pruritus (CKD-aP) 
 In July 2018, we announced the dosing of the first patients in a Phase 2 trial of Oral KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) for the treatment of pruritus in stage III-V (moderate-to-severe) CKD patients. The Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three dose levels (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg and 1 mg, once daily) of Oral KORSUVA versus placebo in approximately 240 stage III-V (moderate to severe) CKD patients with moderate-to-severe pruritus, with a pre-specified interim analysis that allows for expansion of the study to up to 480 patients, if needed. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale, or NRS, score at Week 12 of the treatment period. Secondary endpoints include change from baseline in itch-related quality of life scores at the end of Week 12, as assessed by the total Skindex-10 and 5-D itch scores, as well as the proportion of patients achieving an improvement from baseline ≥3 points with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour Worst Itch NRS score at week 12. We expect top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2019.
 
The dosing of the above Phase 2 trial was informed by the results of our Phase 1 trial of Oral KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) in patients with Stage III - V CKD. Data from the Phase 1 trial was used to assess the PK and safety of different tablet strengths of Oral KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) (for example, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg), dosed daily over a one-week treatment period in three groups of patients with moderate renal impairment and three groups of patients with severe renal impairment (six groups total). The exposure levels achieved with Oral KORSUVA tablets were approximately equivalent to the exposure level achieved with 0.5 mcg/kg dose of I.V. KORSUVA that exhibited statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in itch intensity in hemodialysis patients with moderate to severe CKD-aP in a previous Phase 2 trial.

Oral KORSUVA (CR845/Difelikefalin) for Treatment of Chronic Liver Disease-Associated Pruritus
 Pruritus is a common and irritating symptom in patients with chronic liver disease, or CLD, especially those with chronic cholestatic disease. Severe pruritus can have debilitating effects and can lead to a significant reduction in a patient’s quality of life. Although the pathogenesis of CLD-aP remains poorly understood, it is likely multifactorial including evidence for an imbalance in the endogenous opioid system driven by higher mu receptor activation (pruritic) versus kappa receptor activation (antipruritic). Consequently, the use of selective kappa-opioid receptor agonists has been suggested for the treatment of pruritus in patients with chronic liver disease, or CLD. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2017, we submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA for Oral KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) for symptomatic relief of CLD-aP and initiated a Phase 1 safety and PK clinical trial of Oral KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) in patients with CLD in the first quarter of 2018. The open-label study was designed to evaluate the safety and PK profile of repeated doses of Oral KORSUVA (twice daily) in up to 60 patients with CLD and up to 12 matched healthy control subjects. Oral KORSUVA was evaluated over an eight-day treatment period in patients with CLD based on their Child-Pugh classification (i.e, Class A, B and C). The study is now complete. The PK parameters were dose-proportional in patients with mild-to-moderate CLD and Oral KORSUVA was generally well tolerated with no unexpected safety signals reported. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 trial in chronic liver disease patients with moderate-to-severe pruritus in the second quarter of 2019.
 
Intravenous CR845/Difelikefalin for Treatment of Acute Postoperative Pain
We also investigated CR845/difelikefalin for the treatment of pain in an acute care setting. CR845/difelikefalin is designed to provide pain relief without stimulating mu opioid receptors and therefore potentially without mu opioid-related side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression and euphoria. 
Phase 2/3 Efficacy and Safety Trial of CR845/Difelikefalin Injection in Patients Undergoing Abdominal Surgery
 In June 2018, we reported positive top-line date from the adaptive Phase 2/3 study of CR845/difelikefalin in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. This trial was initiated in September 2015 and was designed as a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group adaptive design trial with repeated doses of CR845/difelikefalin injection or placebo administered both prior to and following abdominal surgery. The trial protocol initially included three dose levels of CR845/difelikefalin injection (1.0 mcg/kg, 2.0 mcg/kg and 5.0 mcg/kg versus placebo) that was subsequently modified in June 2016 to test two doses of I.V. CR845/difelikefalin (1.0 mcg/kg and 0.5 mcg/kg) versus placebo, based on a safety review by us, the trial’s IDMC, and the FDA, of unblinded safety data from the first 90 patients dosed. The safety review was conducted in response to a clinical hold that the FDA placed on the trial in February 2016 and removed in April 2016 following the safety review. The clinical hold was based on a pre-specified stopping rule related to elevated serum sodium levels of greater than 150 mmol/L that was included in the clinical trial protocol. The trial enrolled 444 patients undergoing abdominal surgery, composed of 228 patients who underwent ventral hernia surgery and 216 patients who completed a hysterectomy procedure. The primary endpoint was pain relief as measured by Area Under the Curve, or AUC, of the NRS pain intensity scores collected over the first 24-hour period after the baseline dose (0 hour) post-surgery for all combined surgeries. The secondary endpoints included incidence of vomiting, improvement in impact scores of PONV, reduction in use of rescue analgesic medication, as well as patient global assessment at 24 hours post baseline dose after surgery.

• | CR845 injection achieved statistical significance for the primary endpoint of pain relief over 24 hours (AUC 0-24) post-surgery with the 1.0 mcg/kg dose versus placebo (p=0.032). The 0.5 mcg/kg dose did not achieve statistical significance over the 0-24 hour period (p=0.076). In addition, improvement in pain AUC was statistically significant for both the 0.5 and 1.0 mcg/kg doses over 0 to 6 hours (p=0.041, p=0.001) and 0 to 12 hours (p=0.035, p=0.004) periods and also statistically significant for the 1.0 mcg/kg dose over the 0 to 18-hour period (p=0.013) post-surgery.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | At 6 and 24 hours after baseline dose post-surgery, there were statistically significant improvements in PONV impact scores with both doses of CR845 injection compared to placebo: 0.5 mcg/kg (6 hrs.: p=0.0072, 24 hrs.: p<0.006) and 1.0 mcg/kg (6 hrs.: p<0.0001, 24 hrs.: p<0.0001).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | There were statistically significant differences between placebo and both doses of CR845 with respect to the total use of anti-emetic medication over the first 24 hours post-surgery (0.5 mcg/kg: p=0.0003; 1.0 mcg/kg: p< 0.0001).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There was a 73% reduction in the incidence of patient-reported vomiting in the group receiving the 1.0 mcg/kg dose versus placebo (p=0.029). Although the 0.5 mcg/kg also showed reduction in vomiting, it did not reach statistical significance. Both doses of CR845 exhibited numerical trends toward reduced use of rescue analgesic medication compared to placebo, but did not achieve statistical significance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There was no significant effect, compared to placebo, on patient’s global assessment of medication for either dose of CR845 over the 24-hour period.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Common adverse effects reported in the placebo and both CR845 groups were generally low and similar in incidence, and included nausea, constipation, vomiting, flatulence, headache and dyspepsia.
 
The next steps for the acute post-operative program will be determined after we have completed detailed analysis of the data and consulted with the FDA.
 

Phase 1 Safety and PK and Phase 2 Acute Pain Clinical Trials (Post-Surgery) of CR845/Difelikefalin Injection
 Previously, in three different randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trials, CR845/difelikefalin injection has been shown to be well tolerated and demonstrated efficacy of pain relief. Two of these trials were conducted in patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy, a soft tissue surgical procedure, and a third trial was in patients undergoing bunionectomy, a hard tissue surgical procedure. Intravenous administration of CR845/difelikefalin resulted in statistically significant reductions in pain intensity, as measured by the sum of pain intensity difference. In addition, in both surgical models, CR845/difelikefalin injection exhibited an ability to decrease the opioid-related adverse events, or AEs, of nausea and vomiting associated with current therapies, along with no evidence of drug-related respiratory depression. 
 The safety profile of CR845/difelikefalin injection has been demonstrated in multiple studies. CR845/difelikefalin injection was observed to be generally well tolerated in all of these clinical trials. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, across evaluated populations in acute pain trials were transient facial tingling or numbness, dizziness and fatigue. In addition, a transient increase in urine output in the absence of electrolyte loss, otherwise known as aquaresis, was also observed, which in some subjects in acute pain trials was accompanied by asymptomatic elevations in plasma sodium that were generally considered to be clinically unimportant. No clinically significant changes in electrocardiogram characteristics have been observed in any of these studies. Importantly, there appeared to be no cases of dysphoria/hallucinations typically observed with prior-generation CNS-active kappa agonists. 
 Human Abuse Liability Trial of CR845/Difelikefalin Injection
 In the fourth quarter of 2014, we successfully completed a Human Abuse Liability, or HAL, trial of CR845/difelikefalin injection. The results from this HAL trial indicate that I.V. CR845/difelikefalin (5 mcg/kg or 15 mcg/kg) demonstrates statistically significant lower “drug liking” scores as measured by VAS Emax (p <0.0001) when compared to I.V. pentazocine (0.5 mg/kg), an approved Schedule IV opioid receptor agonist. I.V. CR845 also demonstrated highly statistically significant lower “feeling high,” “overall liking,” and “take drug again” scores (p <0.0001) as compared to pentazocine.  Additionally, CR845/difelikefalin injection showed no “drug liking” dose response as both doses of CR845/difelikefalin injection were the same.  Those scores represent standard subjective measures recommended by the FDA to assess a drug’s abuse liability. We believe that the totality of the results from the HAL trial are supportive of the potential for CR845/difelikefalin to be the first non-scheduled or low (Schedule V) scheduled peripheral kappa opioid for acute pain or pruritus.

Respiratory Safety Phase 1 Trial of CR845/Difelikefalin Injection
 In April 2017, we announced summary results from our quantitative Phase 1 trial evaluating respiratory safety of CR845/difelikefalin injection. Respiratory depression remains the most life-threatening side effect of traditional, centrally acting, opioid analgesics, the most commonly used drug class for current treatment of postoperative pain in the United States. The Phase 1 trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover trial of two doses of CR845/difelikefalin injection versus placebo on three measures of respiratory drive in 15 healthy volunteers. Each subject was randomized to one of three treatment sequences and was administered I.V. bolus placebo, I.V. CR845/difelikefalin (1.0 mcg/kg) and I.V. CR845/difelikefalin (5.0 mcg/kg) on sequential 24-hour periods, with I.V. CR845/difelikefalin (5.0 mcg/kg) representing a projected five-fold supra-therapeutic dose. After each administration, and continuing through four hours post-dosing, end-tidal CO2, or ETCO2, oxygen saturation, or SpO2, and respiratory rate were continuously monitored. The primary safety endpoints were: a >10 mmHg sustained (>30 seconds duration) increase in ETCO2 above baseline or to >50 mmHg, and a sustained reduction in SpO2 to <92 percent. 
 There were no statistically significant differences in any respiratory measures observed between groups throughout the four-hour observation period post-dosing and no individual subject met the threshold for a respiratory safety event. Additionally, all treatment-emergent adverse events were previously reported with CR845/difelikefalin administration and were mild, resolving without intervention. 
 Oral CR845/Difelikefalin for Treatment of Osteoarthritis
 We also investigated an oral version of CR845/difelikefalin, or Oral CR845/difelikefalin for pain relief, which we believe could be used to provide pain relief to patients with acute or chronic pain in an outpatient setting and also as an I.V.-to-oral transition, or step-down, therapy for hospital patients being prepared for discharge. 
 Phase 2b Trial of Oral CR845/Difelikefalin
 In the third quarter of 2016 we initiated a Phase 2b trial with Oral CR845/difelikefalin, which was designed to evaluate three tablet strengths (1.0 mg, 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg), dosed twice-daily over an eight-week treatment period in 476 patients with OA of the knee or hip experiencing moderate-to-severe pain across the United States.  The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at week eight, with respect to the weekly mean of the daily pain intensity score using an NRS score. Secondary endpoints included overall Patient Global Assessment, or PGA, score, and overall improvement in Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index, or WOMAC, scores, two commonly used patient-reported outcome measures, as well as mean reduction in rescue medication.   
 In June 2017, we announced top-line results from the Phase 2b trial. The results of the primary efficacy analysis of change from baseline in pain intensity NRS score comparing Oral CR845/difelikefalin (all doses) vs. placebo were not statistically significant across all patients (OA of the knee or hip). However, patients with OA of the hip maintained on the 5.0 mg dose to the end of the eight-week treatment period exhibited a statistically significant 39% reduction in mean joint pain score versus placebo (p=0.043); although this effect did not reach statistical significance in a combined analysis of all patients with OA of the knee or hip maintained on the 5.0 mg dose (p=0.111). For patients maintained on the 5.0 mg dose, there was a statistically significant increase in the proportion of patients whose OA pain was “very much improved” or “much improved” as indicated by PGA score in both the total patient group (p <0.005 vs. placebo) and in patients with primary OA of the hip (p<0.006 vs. placebo). The reduction in pain score in the 5.0 mg dose group in hip patients was accompanied by a reduction in mean rescue medication of 41% at week eight versus placebo. Patients maintained on the 1.0 mg and 2.5 mg tablet strengths did not exhibit significant reductions in mean joint pain scores compared to placebo. All tablet strengths were generally well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events. For the 5.0 mg dose, the most common adverse events reported at the >5 percent incidence level were dry mouth (6%) and constipation (12%). There were no clinically significant changes in serum sodium levels observed during the eight-week treatment period for any dose group. 
 14
 

In 2015, we completed a Phase 2a trial of Oral CR845/difelikefalin in 80 patients with OA of the knee or hip with moderate-to-severe pain evaluating four tablet strengths (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 5.0 mg) administered twice a day over a two-week treatment period. We reported data that showed dose related reduction in mean joint pain score and that all four tablet strengths were observed to be generally well tolerated with no unexpected safety signals reported.
 We do not intend to develop Oral CR845/difelikefalin in pain associated with OA on our own and will likely seek one or more potential partner(s) for further development of Oral CR845/difelikefalin in this indication.
 CR701
 In addition to our CR845/difelikefalin family of peripheral kappa agonists, we have discovered lead molecules that selectively modulate peripheral cannabinoid receptors. Studies on the effects of cannabis have led to the discovery of an endogenous system of ligands in humans involved in a number of physiological processes, including pain and inflammation. The main naturally occurring ligands for this system, anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), activate a number of cannabinoid receptors, including CB1 and CB2 receptors. Like opioid receptors, CB1 and CB2 receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. CB1 receptors and associated ligands are mainly localized in the brain, whereas CB2 receptors are found mainly in peripheral tissues, particularly immune cells such as leukocytes and mast cells, which have been shown to be involved in pain and inflammatory responses. 
 Our most advanced CB compound, CR701, is a peripherally-restricted, mixed-CB1/CB2 receptor agonist that selectively interacts with these cannabinoid receptor subtypes, with no off-target activities. The compound is orally bioavailable, active in preclinical models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and does not produce the side effects characteristic of centrally-active cannabinoids, such as sedation and hypothermia.  Accordingly, CR701 would be expected to have substantially less abuse potential than centrally-active cannabinoids, but retain activity against therapeutically valuable peripheral targets, similar in principle to CR845/difelikefalin.

Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. 
 In April 2013, we entered into a license agreement with Maruishi, or the Maruishi Agreement, under which we granted Maruishi an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize drug products containing CR845/difelikefalin in Japan in the acute pain and uremic pruritus fields. Maruishi has a right of first negotiation for any other indications for which we develop CR845/difelikefalin and, under certain conditions, Maruishi may substitute another pruritus indication for the uremic pruritus indication originally included in its license from us. If we abandon development of CR845/difelikefalin and begin development of another kappa opioid receptor agonist that is covered by the claims of the patents we licensed to Maruishi, such other agonist will automatically be included in the license to Maruishi. Maruishi is required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at its expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize CR845/difelikefalin in Japan. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at our expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize CR845/difelikefalin in the United States. 
 Under the terms of the Maruishi Agreement, we received a non-refundable and non-creditable upfront license fee of $15.0 million and are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $10.5 million in clinical development and regulatory milestones. In August 2014, we received a milestone payment of $0.5 million upon the completion by Maruishi of a Phase 1 clinical trial in Japan related to CR845/difelikefalin in acute post-operative pain. In September 2015, Maruishi initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of CR845/difelikefalin in Japan for uremic pruritus, which triggered a $1.7 million milestone payment (net of contractual foreign currency exchange adjustments of $0.3 million) to us. In March 2017, we received a payment of $0.8 million from Maruishi when it entered into a sub-license agreement with Kissei related to CR845/difelikefalin. We are also eligible to receive a one-time sales milestone of one billion Yen when a certain sales level is attained. We also receive a mid-double-digit percentage of all non-royalty payments received by Maruishi from its sublicensees, if any. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties based on net sales, if any, with minimum royalty rates in the low double digits and maximum royalty rates in the low twenties. Maruishi’s obligation to pay us royalties continues, on a product-by-product basis, until the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent covering such product or the later expiration of any market exclusivity period. The Maruishi Agreement continues until terminated. Either we or Maruishi may terminate the Maruishi Agreement for the other party’s breach of the agreement or bankruptcy. Maruishi may terminate the agreement at any time at will. We may terminate the agreement as a whole if Maruishi challenges the licensed patent rights, and we may terminate the agreement with respect to any indication if Maruishi discontinues its development activities. In addition, in connection with the license agreement, Maruishi made an $8.0 million equity investment in our company. 
 
Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical Corporation 
 In April 2012, we entered into a license agreement with CKDP, or the CKDP Agreement, under which we granted CKDP an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize drug products containing CR845/difelikefalin in South Korea. CKDP is required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at its expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize CR845/difelikefalin in South Korea. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at our expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize CR845/difelikefalin in the United States. 
 Under the terms of the CKDP Agreement, we received a non-refundable and non-creditable $0.6 million upfront payment and are eligible to earn up to an aggregate of $3.8 million in development and regulatory milestones. In addition, in connection with the CKDP Agreement, CKDP made a $0.4 million equity investment in our company. We will also receive a mid-double-digit percentage of all non-royalty payments received by CKDP from its sublicensees, if any. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from the high single digits to the high teens based on net sales, if any. CKDP’s obligation to pay us royalties continues, on a product-by-product basis, until the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent covering such product or the later expiration of any market exclusivity period.
 16
 

During 2012, we received an additional $0.6 million, net of foreign taxes, from CKDP upon the achievement of two clinical development milestones under the CKDP Agreement. During 2015, we received a total of $0.6 million, net of foreign taxes, from CKDP upon the achievement of two clinical development milestones under the CKDP Agreement. The CKDP Agreement continues until CKDP no longer has any obligation to pay us royalties on any product. Either we or CKDP may terminate the CKDP Agreement for the other party’s breach of the CKDP Agreement or bankruptcy. CKDP may terminate the CKDP Agreement if any of the licensed patent rights is invalid, unenforceable, is narrowed in scope or is deemed unpatentable, except as a result of a challenge by CKDP, or a third party commercializes a product containing a compound identical to CR845/difelikefalin without infringing any of the licensed patent rights in South Korea. We may terminate the CKDP Agreement if CKDP challenges the licensed patent rights or if a third party in South Korea owns an issued patent that claims CR845/difelikefalin and CKDP’s sale of products would infringe that patent. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 In executing our strategy, our goal is to have significant control over the development process and commercial execution for CR845/difelikefalin in the United States, if approved. 
 
We anticipate developing a distribution capability and commercial organization in the United States to market and sell KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection, if approved, in the dialysis setting, while out-licensing commercialization rights in certain geographical territories outside of the United States. For Oral KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin), we plan to develop and commercialize our drug candidate in pruritus indications, such as CKD-aP, CLD-aP and potentially others, on our own in the United States, while exploring partnerships for development and commercialization in geographical territories outside the United States.
 In 2015, we commissioned a qualitative market research study of nephrologists to evaluate the commercial potential of KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) for CKD-aP. The study suggests KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) would be well received by nephrologists, if approved. The key findings from the study were:
• | There is a clear unmet need to manage CKD-aP among dialysis patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Currently, there are no effective options for severe CKD-aP.

• | CR845/difelikefalin demonstrates impressive efficacy for CKD-aP.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Physicians were impressed with placebo-like adverse event profile.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection can easily be incorporated into dialysis sessions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As a result, we believe that, if successful, KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) is well positioned to address the unmet needs for hemodialysis patients suffering from CKD-aP. 
 We had also commissioned market research for I.V. CR845/difelikefalin for the treatment of postoperative pain that suggests it would be well received by physicians, if approved. This research indicated that in addition to providing pain relief, reducing side effects such as nausea and vomiting, were among the highest unmet needs in the postoperative setting. In our three Phase 2 trials, I.V. CR845/difelikefalin demonstrated statistically significant pain relief and statistically significant reductions in nausea and vomiting. As a result, we believe that, if successful, I.V. CR845/difelikefalin is well positioned to address unmet needs in the postoperative pain market.  
 
Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business. As more fully described below, patent applications have been filed covering compositions of matter for and methods of using CR845/difelikefalin. Twelve U.S. patents directed to CR845/difelikefalin and its uses have been issued, which are expected to expire no earlier than 2027. We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.  
 17
 

Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of peripheral analgesia and treatment of pruritus. 
 A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, which are important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. If we were not able to obtain a license or were not able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed, possibly materially. 
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to novel peripheral analgesics and novel uses of our proprietary compounds. We anticipate seeking patent protection in the United States and internationally for the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these compounds and the use of these compounds in a variety of therapies.  
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and the patent’s scope can be modified after issuance by later judicial decisions. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be adequately protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. 
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for up to 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of our entitlement to the inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, although unlikely, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention, or in post-grant challenge proceedings in the USPTO, or a foreign patent office such as oppositions, inter-partes review, post grant review, or a derivation proceeding, that challenge our entitlement to an invention or the patentability of one or more claims in our patent applications or issued patents. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. 
 The patent portfolios for our most advanced programs are summarized below. 
 CR845/Difelikefalin
Our synthetic peptide amide kappa opioid agonist patent portfolio is wholly owned by us. The portfolio includes fifteen issued U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 7,402,564; 7,713,937; 7,727,963; 7,842,662; 8,217,007; 8,236,766; 8,486,894; 8,536,131; 8,906,859; 8,951,970; 9,321,810; 9,334,305; 9,359,399; 10,017,536; and 10,138,270) with claims to compositions of a wide range of synthetic peptide amide kappa opioid agonists, including CR845/difelikefalin and related molecules, as well as methods of using these compounds. U.S. Patent No. 7,402,564, which is the earliest issued U.S. patent claiming CR845/difelikefalin compositions is due to expire November 12, 2027, although under certain circumstances the patent term may be extended for up to a further five (5) years based upon the Hatch-Waxman Act. The CR845/difelikefalin patent portfolio also includes pending U.S. patent applications which claim additional uses and methods of administering CR845/difelikefalin. Related foreign applications were filed in more than 40 other countries. National patents have been granted in 31 European countries, as well as in Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea. These granted foreign patents with claims to CR845/difelikefalin are due expire no earlier than November 12, 2027. The sole remaining patent application claiming CR845/difelikefalin is still pending in Brazil. The Brazilian patent law provides for a patent term extension of up to ten years for pharmaceutical patents to compensate for the loss of patent term during prosecution. 
 18
 

CR701 
 Our imidazoheterocycle cannabinoid compound patent portfolio, which is wholly owned by us, includes U.S. Patent Nos. 7,517,874; 8,431,565; and 8,859,538. These U.S. patents are due to expire no earlier than June 20, 2028. A related international PCT application was filed and sixteen national patent applications and a European regional patent application has been filed based on the international patent application. The European regional patent has been granted as have national patents in Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Russia, South Africa and South Korea. These and any other patents resulting from the pending national patent applications, if issued, expire no earlier than June 20, 2028. A patent application claiming CR701 is still pending in Brazil.  
 Other Cara Patents and Patent Applications 
 We also own several other U.S. Patents including U.S. Patent Nos. 7,741,350; 7,960,376; 7,960,377; and 8,211,926 with claims to other cannabinoid compounds and U.S. Patent No. 8,217,000 with claims to regulation of prolactin in mammals including humans. 
 In addition, our kappa receptor opioid peptide international patent portfolio, which is wholly owned by us, includes claims to CR665, our first-generation kappa opioid receptor agonist, related compounds, and methods of using these compounds. The international PCT patent application PCT/US98/27282 was filed and progeny national patent applications have been granted in over 40 other countries. Granted patents with claims to CR665 were maintained in Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Russia, Spain and the U.K. and expired on December 22, 2018, except for the Brazilian patent, the term of which has been extended to October 21, 2024 to compensate for patent office delays. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a PCT application or a non-provisional patent application. The term of a patent in the United States can be adjusted and extended due to the failure of the United States Patent and Trademark Office following certain statutory and regulation deadlines for progressing prosecution and issuing a patent. 
 In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for a portion of the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-United States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. Although we intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development, or R&D, or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property.

Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and medical technology companies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 There are a large number of companies developing or marketing therapies for the indications that we are pursuing. Many of our competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Small or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We also compete with these companies in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials. 
 We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, are likely to be their safety, efficacy and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement from government and third-party payers. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products that broadly address these indications are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. 
 If our product candidates are approved for the indications for which we are currently undertaking clinical trials, they will compete with the therapies and currently marketed drugs discussed below: 
 KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection - Uremic Pruritus or CKD-aP. We are developing KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) injection for the management of CKD-aP in hemodialysis patients. Currently, there are no approved products for management of CKD-aP in the United States.  However, there are many products that are used to help manage CKD-aP.  The most common of these agents are anti-itch creams and emollients as well as oral or injectable antihistamines.  All of these products have limited degrees of efficacy and are available generically.  Additionally, patients may try several other agents such as gabapentin or naltrexone, generally with limited success or therapies such as UVB light therapy with limited availability.  
 Because of the substantial unmet need for products that are safe and effective in CKD-aP, there are other companies that either were in the past or are currently involved in the discovery, development, and/or marketing of such products for CKD-aP or related conditions. Some of such product candidates or products include nalbuphine from Trevi Therapeutics, asimadoline from Tioga Pharmaceuticals, SK-1405 from Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho, and 
Remitch® or nalfurafine from Toray Industries. 
 20
 

Oral KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) – Chronic Pruritus. We are developing Oral KORSUVA (CR845/difelikefalin) for the management of moderate-to-severe chronic pruritus conditions like CKD-aP or CLD-aP. There are currently no products approved in the United States for CKD-aP or CLD-aP. The market for the management of moderate-to-severe chronic pruritus is highly fragmented and includes numerous generic products, including oral formulations of corticosteroids and antihistamines. The most common corticosteroids and antihistamines are available generically. Because of the size and untapped potential of the chronic pruritus market and the substantial unmet need for products that are safe and effective, there are other companies involved in the discovery, development, and/or marketing of new products for pruritus. Some product candidates being developed for pruritus or pruritic conditions include Menlo Therapeutics’ serlopitant, Trevi’s nalbuphine ER and Vanda’s tradipitant.  
 I.V. CR845/difelikefalin – Acute Pain. We are developing I.V. CR845/difelikefalin for the management of acute postoperative pain in adult patients. The market for management of postoperative pain is highly fragmented and can be segmented into three general classes of products: 

• | mu opioid-based products, such as morphine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, and hydromorphone, all of which are available generically;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | local anesthetic-based products, such as lidocaine and bupivacaine, which are available generically; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adjunctive analgesics, which are defined as non-mu opioid pain-relieving drugs that provide additional control of postoperative pain.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There has been a trend in recent years for anesthesiologists to use all three classes of products to manage postoperative pain, often referred to as “multimodal analgesia.” If approved, I.V. CR845/difelikefalin would be competing within the overall acute postoperative pain market, although we expect that it would compete primarily with injectable mu-opioid analgesics, such as morphine, fentanyl and hydromorphone.  Although these products are generically available, they cause significant mu-opioid side effects such as nausea and vomiting, sedation, constipation and respiratory depression, which add significant cost to managing a post-operative patient.
 In addition to the above products approved for use as adjunctive analgesics for moderate-to-severe pain, there have been clinical reports that generic drugs originally approved for other indications, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, as well as dexmedetomidine, dextromethorphan, and clonidine may exhibit efficacy in the treatment of postoperative pain, and these and other such drugs may be used off-label for this purpose and, therefore, also compete with I.V. CR845/difelikefalin. Additionally, numerous companies are developing additional product candidates for the treatment of acute postoperative pain. 
 Oral CR845/difelikefalin– Chronic Pain. The market for the management of moderate-to-severe chronic pain is highly fragmented and includes numerous generic as well as brand name products, including oral formulations of NSAIDs and controlled-release mu opioids. Common NSAIDs include Celebrex®, which is marketed by Pfizer, and naproxen and ibuprofen, which are available generically. Common branded oral mu opioids include, among others: Avinza®, an extended-release morphine sulfate capsule marketed by Pfizer; EXALGO®, an extended-release hydromorphone hydrochloride tablet marketed by Mallinckrodt; KADIAN®, an extended-release morphine sulfate capsule marketed by Allergan; NUCYNTA® ER, an extended release formulation of tapentadol marketed by Collegium and OxyContin®, a controlled-release oxycodone hydrochloride tablet marketed by Purdue Pharma. In addition to oral therapies, Janssen Pharmaceuticals markets Duragesic®, a fentanyl transdermal patch.     
 Because of the size of the chronic pain market and the substantial unmet need for products that are safe and effective, there are a large number of companies involved in the discovery, development, and/or marketing of such products. These product candidates include immediate release and extended release formulations of various NSAIDs and mu opioids. These include combination products that include mu opioid combined with an NSAID or acetaminophen, such as Abbvie’s Vicodin® (hydrocodone and acetaminophen) and Endo Pharmaceuticals’ Percocet® (oxycodone and acetaminophen). Additionally, there are other product candidates in development with non-opioid mechanisms of action.  
 
21
 

Manufacturing 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. At this time, none of our contract manufacturing agreements limit where, or with whom we can contract for commercial manufacture or distribution. It is our intention that by the time of any regulatory approvals for commercialization, we will have negotiated long-term commitments with at least one primary supplier for each manufacturing and distribution function. 
 All of our product candidates are either small peptides or organic small molecules and are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale up and does not require any special equipment or technology in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 
FDA Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practices, or cGCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to determine cGCP compliance;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22
 

 
• | FDA review and approval of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------


• | potential DEA review and scheduling activities prior to launch for some of our product candidates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical Studies. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of drug substance chemistry, toxicity and drug product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Manufacture of drug substance, drug product and the labeling and distribution of clinical supplies must all comply with cGMP standards. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Marketing Approval. Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review of an application. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
 23
 

The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks and ensure safe use of the drug. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an external advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a Pre-Approval Inspection. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCP. 
 The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all. 
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. For some products, an additional step of DEA review and scheduling is required. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 24
 

Breakthrough Therapy Designation. The FDA may expedite the review of a product candidate designated as a breakthrough therapy, which is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A sponsor may request the FDA to designate a drug as a breakthrough therapy at the time of, or any time after, the submission of an IND application for the drug. If the FDA designates a drug as a breakthrough therapy, it must take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. The FDA may rescind a Breakthrough Therapy designation in the future if further clinical development later shows that the criteria for designation are no longer met. Breakthrough Therapy designation does not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or review process.
 Post-Approval Requirements. Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, and compliance with any post-approval requirements imposed as a condition of approval, such as Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to assess safety and effectiveness after commercialization. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. 
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications, pharmaceutical companies generally are required to promote their drug products only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
 
DEA Regulation 

 I.V. CR845/difelikefalin, Oral CR845/difelikefalin or our other product candidates, if approved, may be regulated as a “controlled substance” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control of handlers of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. 
 The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. The manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use of Schedule II substances are subject to a high degree of regulation. 
 Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. 
 The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports. 
 In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our quota of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches. 
 To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we and our collaborators will be subject to state regulation with respect to the distribution of these products.

Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws and Regulations 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state health care regulatory laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include, among other things, anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, physician payment transparency laws and regulations, as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. 
 Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Health Care Reform Law”), to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.  
 Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The federal civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare provider or supplier numbers when detailing a provider of services, improper promotion of off-label uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug’s label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute, which, among other things, imposes fines against any person or entity who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.  
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements on certain types of individuals and entities subject to the law, known as covered entities, such as certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, 
relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes security standards and certain privacy standards directly applicable to the 
business associates of covered entities that perform services for them that involve the creation, use, 
 27
 

maintenance or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws may govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.  
 Additionally, federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act created under Section 6002 of the Health Care Reform Law and its implementing regulations, require that manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors of medicine, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), generally, with some exceptions, and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals. Additionally, applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations are required to report annually to CMS certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. 
 There are also an increasing number of analogous state laws that require manufacturers to file reports with states on pricing and marketing information, such as tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations, other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and healthcare entities. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with such laws. For example, several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish and implement commercial compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities and/or register their sales representatives. Certain state laws also regulate manufacturers’ use of prescriber-identifiable data. These laws may affect our future sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions once we commercialize could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, individual 
imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.  
 
Coverage and Reimbursement Generally  
 The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental payer programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our product candidates. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payers often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government provides reimbursement through the Medicare or Medicaid programs for such products and services. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional 
 28
 

inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains additional drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors which, among other things, may affect rebates paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, the purpose of which is to further reduce the cost of drug products to consumers. Although a number of these, and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general.  
 Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. In addition, many U.S. hospitals receive a fixed reimbursement amount per procedure for certain surgeries and other treatment therapies they perform, or a predetermined rate for all hospital inpatient care provided as payment in full. Because this amount may not be based on the actual expenses the hospital incurs, hospitals may choose to use therapies which are less expensive when compared to our product candidates. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payers. Third-party payers are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products, including pharmaceuticals. For example, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Additionally, third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Therefore, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved, and one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that healthcare payers and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates.

Healthcare Regulatory Developments     
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape with respect to healthcare continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
 For example, the Health Care Reform Law was passed in March 2010 and includes provisions that have substantially changed healthcare financing by both governmental and private insurers. Among other provisions that could have an impact on our business, the Health Care Reform Law revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research. Additionally, the Health Care Reform Law implemented a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the outpatient drugs being covered under Medicare Part D.  
The Health Care Reform Law’s future 
impact on our business is unclear. 
 Some of the provisions of the Health Care Reform Law have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Health Care Reform Law or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Health Care Reform Law. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Health Care Reform Law. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Health Care Reform Law have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Health Care Reform Law on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On January 23, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Health Care Reform Law-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the Health Care Reform Law, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans. In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain Health Care Reform Law qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Health Care Reform Law risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Health Care Reform Law is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the TCJA. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law will impact the Health Care Reform Law.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. In August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 
 30
 

up to 2% per fiscal year starting in 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, and subsequent legislative amendments, including the BBA, will remain in effect until 2027, unless additional congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare payments and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operations. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could further limit the prices we are able to charge, or the amounts of reimbursement available, for our product candidates once they are approved.   
 
Foreign Regulation 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For example, in the European Union, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application, or CTA, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
Employees 
 As of March 5, 2019, we had 55 employees, all of whom are located in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
