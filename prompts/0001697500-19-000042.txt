 Item 1.      Business
 Our Predecessor and Solaris
 Solaris LLC was formed in July 2014. Solaris Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in February 2017 for the purpose of completing an initial public offering of equity in May 2017 (the "IPO" or the "Offering") and related transactions. On May 11, 2017, in connection with the IPO, Solaris Inc. became a holding company whose sole material asset consists of units in Solaris LLC ("Solaris LLC Units"). In connection with the closing of the IPO, Solaris Inc. became the managing member of Solaris LLC and is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions relating to Solaris LLC's business and consolidates the financial results of Solaris LLC and its subsidiaries. Overview
 We are an independent provider of supply chain management and logistics solutions designed to drive efficiencies and reduce costs for the oil and natural gas industry. Our solutions include high-efficiency mobile and permanent infrastructure that increases proppant and chemical throughput capacity at critical junctures in the supply chain, as well as software solutions designed to optimize how proppant and chemicals are distributed across the supply chain. Our primary customers include both oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”) companies and oil and natural gas service companies.
 We manufacture and primarily rent our mobile proppant and chemical management systems that unload, store and deliver proppant and chemicals at oil and natural gas well sites. We ended 2018 with 160 patented mobile proppant management systems and three patent-pending mobile chemical management systems in our fleet. Our systems reduce our customers' cost and time to complete wells by improving the efficiency of well site logistics, as well as enhancing well site safety. Our systems are deployed in most of the active oil and natural gas basins in the United States, including the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale, the SCOOP/STACK formations, the Haynesville Shale, the Rockies, the Marcellus and Utica Shales and the Bakken.
 Each system is equipped with our proprietary inventory management system, Solaris Lens™, which enables our customers to track inventory levels in, and delivery rates from, each silo in a system on a real-time and remote basis. We recently integrated our software with third-party trucking software solutions to provide full visibility from vendor-to-well site for certain customers.
 In conjunction with our mobile proppant systems offering, we also provide “last mile” management services for customers that prefer to outsource the delivery of proppant from the vendor to the well site. 
 We also operate an independent, transload facility in Oklahoma (the “Kingfisher Facility”) that further integrates our supply chain management and drives additional well site logistics efficiencies for our customers.
 As illustrated in the following chart, we have increased our total system revenue days, defined as the combined number of days our systems earned revenues, by more than 4,368% from 2014 to 2018, representing a 159% compound annual growth rate. The 

 
  6
 
increase in total system revenue days is attributable to both an increase in the number of systems available for rental and the demand for our systems.

     Organizational Structure 
 Solaris Inc. was incorporated in February 2017 for the purpose of completing an initial public offering and related transactions. Our IPO was completed on May 17, 2017. 
 In connection with the closing of the IPO, Solaris Inc. became the managing member of Solaris LLC and is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions relating to Solaris LLC's business. Solaris Inc. consolidates the financial results of Solaris LLC and its subsidiaries and reports non-controlling interest related to the portion of the Solaris LLC Units not owned by Solaris Inc., which will reduce net income (loss) attributable to the holders of Solaris Inc.’s Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2018, Solaris Inc. owned 58% of Solaris LLC.
 Each share of Class B common stock has no economic rights but entitles its holder to one vote on all matters to be voted on by stockholders generally. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. We do not intend to list our Class B common stock on any exchange.
 In connection with the IPO, Solaris Inc. entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”) with each member of Solaris LLC immediately prior to the IPO (each such person and any permitted transferee, a “TRA Holder,” and together, the “TRA Holders”). The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement commenced upon the IPO and will continue until all tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement have been utilized or expired, unless we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement. The Tax Receivable Agreement generally provides for the payment by Solaris Inc. to each TRA Holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in United States federal, state and local income tax and franchise tax that Solaris Inc. actually realizes (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances in periods after the IPO as a result of (i) certain increases in tax basis that occur as a result of Solaris Inc.’s acquisition (or deemed acquisition for United States federal income tax purposes) of all or a portion of such TRA Holder’s Solaris LLC Units in connection with the series of reorganization transactions completed on May 17, 2017 (the “Reorganization Transactions”) or pursuant to the exercise of the Redemption Right or the Call Right (each as defined in Solaris LLC’s limited liability company agreement (as amended and restated, the “Solaris LLC Agreement”)) and (ii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by Solaris Inc. as a result of, and additional tax basis arising from, any payments Solaris Inc. makes under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Solaris Inc. will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings. For additional information regarding the Tax Receivable Agreement, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock.”

 Our History
 We were formed in 2014 in connection with the purchase of two proppant management systems from Loadcraft Industries, Ltd., the original manufacturer of the systems, under an exclusive marketing arrangement. In September 2014, we acquired Loadcraft Industries' proppant management system manufacturing business, including a manufacturing facility located in Early, Texas, and commenced our manufacturing operations.
 Between our inception in 2014 and December 31, 2018, we have grown our fleet of proppant management systems from two systems to 160 systems and our fleet of chemical management systems from zero to three systems, improved the capabilities of our systems and developed additional potential product offerings. 
 Products and Services
 We provide several products and services designed to increase efficiency, ensure reliable supply and reduce logistical costs to deliver and manage proppant and chemicals used during the completion phase of oil and gas well development. Our primary offerings include:
· | System Rental – We manufacture and rent equipment to manage the delivery, handling and storage of proppant and chemicals at the well site. Our systems are highly mobile and can be easily deployed to any North American basin, do not require any specialized equipment to transport or deliver proppant or chemicals to the well site.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o | Mobile Proppant Management System – Our patented mobile proppant management systems typically contain six silos, two base units and one central conveyor. The six-silo configuration has the capacity to store approximately 2.5 million pounds of proppant and provides 24 unloading points for pneumatic trucks to deliver proppant into the silos. We also offer a non-pneumatic kit that allows our system to receive proppant from belly dump trucks. We believe our six-silo system provides increased inventory capacity compared to other systems, which reduces the amount of truck demurrage, or wait time, at the well site. Our systems are scalable in increments of three, including our 12-silo configuration, which provides a larger buffer to help manage increased proppant loadings, increased reliance on trucking for logistics as sand development shifts to in-basin sources and multi-well pad development activity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Mobile Chemical Management System – Our patent-pending mobile chemical management systems typically contain three silos, one base unit, and a system of pumps meters and hoses to measure and deliver up to six different completion chemicals to the pressure pumping company’s blender. The three-silo configuration provides increased inventory capacity and control in a smaller footprint when compared to traditional storage and delivery methods which typically include a chem add unit, frac tanks, ISO tanks and dozens of manually operated totes on flatbed trailers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Inventory Management Software – Each of our systems is equipped with sensors and our integrated Solaris Lens software system that enables our customers to track inventory and throughput volumes of each silo or silo compartment on a remote and real-time basis. With the integration of our Railtronix® software and third-party trucking applications, we can provide full visibility of the proppant and chemical from the vendor to the well site supply chain for certain customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Field Services – We provide trained personnel to maintain and support our systems, train our customers to operate the systems and assist in the transportation of our systems. In addition, we provide last mile proppant logistics services, including managing logistics from source to well site.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Transloading Services – At our Kingfisher Facility in Oklahoma, we provide manifest and unit-train transloading services, as well as provide forward staging storage of regional and local proppant.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Inventory Software Services – We provide real-time inventory management software, Railtronix, that enables our customers to monitor and measure proppant loaded into railcars or trucks at transload facilities or mines.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Manufacturing
 We manufacture our systems in our facility in Early, Texas (the “Early Facility”). Early is located in central Texas, which provides convenient access to several of our most active operating areas, including the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale, the SCOOP/STACK formations and the Haynesville Shale. Our manufacturing process involves cutting, rolling and welding steel and assembly and testing of our systems. In 2018, we began incorporating the manufacture of new product lines such as our mobile chemical management systems and our non-pneumatic loading equipment. We have historically outsourced and may continue to outsource the manufacturing of certain components of our products in order to optimize our manufacturing capacity. When necessary, we also perform major repairs and overhauls of our systems in the Early Facility. We believe our Early Facility is a competitive advantage that provides us with a greater ability to control manufacturing costs, as well as additional supply chain and quality security and research and development capabilities. Kingfisher Facility
 The Kingfisher Facility is located central to the SCOOP/STACK plays and is capable of servicing multiple large volume customers. The Kingfisher Facility has over 45,000 feet of rail track and 30,000 tons of proppant storage in six silos with individual capacity of 5,000 tons per silo. The Kingfisher Facility services manifest and unit-trains and provides high efficiency silo and direct rail-to-truck transloading, in addition to forward staging storage. See our discussion of the Kingfisher Facility in Item 7. “—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.

 Raw Materials and Key Suppliers
 The primary raw materials used in the manufacturing of our systems are steel in the form of plate, bar stock and square and round tubing. We purchase steel and most other raw materials and components on the open market and rely on third parties for providing certain materials, including axles, motors and generators. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of raw materials and finished goods to meet our manufacturing requirements because these items are generally available from multiple sources. However, prices for such raw materials and finished goods can fluctuate widely and represent a significant portion of the cost of manufacturing our systems. Accordingly, our cost of revenue and capital costs may be affected by changes in the market price or disruptions in the availability of raw materials, components and sourced finished goods, and significant increases in the cost of steel or other raw materials and motors, generators and other components could adversely affect our revenues or increase our costs. Steel represents 10% to 15%, purchased parts represent 40% to 50% and labor and indirect manufacturing costs represent 30% to 50% of the total cost of manufacturing a typical system.
 We purchase the materials used in the manufacturing of our systems from various suppliers. We also work with select third-party manufacturers to fabricate certain components to supplement our internal production capacity during periods of peak demand. During the year ended December 31, 2018, two suppliers, BWJ Metalworks LLC and Heil Trailer International Co., accounted for approximately 13% and 11%, respectively, of our total spending. During the year ended December 31, 2017, no supplier accounted for more than 10% of our total spending. During the year ended December 31, 2016, one supplier, RNB Controls, Inc., accounted for approximately 17% of our total purchases.
 We have historically relied on a limited number of suppliers for certain critical components used in our systems. To date, we have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our manufacturing operations on a timely basis. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or products by one of our suppliers, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption or shortage in the supply of certain of our materials. In addition, certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future. As a result, we may be unable to mitigate any future supply shortages and our results of operations, prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected.
 Our Customers and Contracts
 Our primary customers are major E&P and oilfield service companies. We generally execute master service agreements ("MSAs") with our customers. Generally, the MSAs govern the relationship with our customers with specific work performed under individual work orders. We typically provide our services on a monthly basis; however, some work orders with our core customers have minimum system commitments with early termination penalties. For the year ended December 31, 2018, EOG Resources, Inc., ProPetro Holding Corp. and BJ Services, LLC, accounted for approximately 15%, 10% and 10%, respectively, of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, EOG Resources, Inc., ProPetro Holding Corp., Schlumberger Technology Corporation and Devon Energy Corporation, accounted for approximately 23%, 15%, 13% and 11%, respectively, of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, EOG Resources, Inc. and ProPetro Holding Corp. accounted for approximately 39% and 11%, respectively, of our total revenues. Approximately 90% of our current fleet is deployed to customers who are renting multiple systems. Competition
 The oil and natural gas services industry is highly competitive. Please read Item 1A. "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We face significant competition that may impede our ability to gain market share or cause us to lose market share or that could make adoption of new product offerings difficult." There are numerous large and small services companies in all regions of the United States with whom we compete. We face competition from proppant and chemical producers and proppant and chemical transporters who also offer solutions for unloading, storing and delivering proppant and chemicals at well sites and also from competitors who are focused on developing more efficient proppant and chemical logistic solutions. Our main competitors include U.S. Silica, Proppant Express Solutions, LLC, Hi-Crush Partners LP, National Oilwell Varco, Inc., CIG Logistics, OmniTRAX, Inc., Smart Sand Inc., Sand Revolution LLC, Total Sand Solution and Hoover Ferguson Group, Inc. We also face competition from pressure pumping companies that own their own proppant and chemical handling equipment. Many of these companies may be customers of ours on certain jobs while also utilizing their own equipment on other jobs.

 Although some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, we believe that we are well positioned competitively due to our existing market share, patent-protected technology, unique service offerings, low cost of operation and strong operational track record. The most important factors on which we compete are product and service quality, performance, reliability and price. Demand for our systems and services and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our systems and services, are closely linked to proppant and chemical consumption patterns for the completion of oil and natural gas wells in North America. These consumption patterns are influenced by numerous factors, including the price for hydrocarbons, the drilling rig count and hydraulic fracturing activity, including the number and rate of stages completed and the amount of proppant or chemical used per stage. Further, these consumption patterns are also influenced by the location, quality, price and availability of proppant and chemicals.
 Segment Information and Geographic Area
 Operating segments are defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) as components of an enterprise that (i) engage in activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (ii) for which separate operational financial information is available and is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance.
 Solaris Inc.’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer. Solaris Inc. and the Chief Executive Officer view the Solaris LLC’s operations and manage its business as one operating segment.  All of our operations are conducted in one geographic area of the United States. For additional information, see Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 
 Seasonality
 Our business is not significantly impacted by seasonality, although our fourth quarter activity has historically been impacted by holidays and our clients’ budget cycles, during which we may experience declines in our operating results.
 In addition, we provide our proppant management systems and services to E&P companies operating in oil and natural gas producing basins where severe weather conditions may curtail drilling activities and, as a result, impact our revenues generated from those regions. For a discussion of the impact of weather on our operations, please read “Risk Factors—Seasonal weather conditions and natural disasters could severely disrupt normal operations and harm our business.”
 Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
 Our business operations are subject to stringent federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection.  Numerous governmental entities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions, including the incurrence of potentially significant capital or operating expenditures to mitigate or prevent releases of materials from our equipment, facilities or from customer locations where we are deploying our proppant and chemical management systems and providing our services. These laws and regulations may, among other things require the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities; restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment; require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations; impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations and support services.
 The more significant of these existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations include the following U.S. legal standards, as amended from time to time:

· | the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various pre-construction, operational, monitoring, and reporting requirements, and that the EPA has relied upon as authority for adopting climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  11
 


· | the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which subjects owners and operators of vessels, onshore facilities, and pipelines, as well as lessees or permittees of areas in which offshore facilities are located, to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in waters of the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), which ensures the quality of the nation’s public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of waste fluids into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which govern oil and natural gas operations on federal lands and waters and impose obligations for establishing financial assurances for decommissioning activities, liabilities for pollution cleanup costs resulting from operations, and potential liabilities for pollution damages;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which requires facilities to implement a safety hazard communication program and disseminate information to employees, local emergency planning committees, and response departments on toxic chemical uses and inventories;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Endangered Species Act, which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats by the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to impact the environment and that may require the preparation of environmental assessments and more detailed environmental impact statements that may be made available for public review and comment; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Department of Transportation regulations, which relate to advancing the safe transportation of energy and hazardous materials and emergency response preparedness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Additionally, there exist regional, state and local jurisdictions in the United States where we operate that also have, or are developing or considering developing, similar environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations governing many of these same types of activities. While the legal requirements imposed in state and local jurisdictions may be similar in form to federal laws and regulations, in some cases the actual implementation of these requirements may impose additional, or more stringent, conditions or controls that can significantly restrict, delay or cancel the permitting, development, or expansion of a project or substantially increase the cost of doing business. Additionally, our operations may require state-law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project's impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations, and scenic areas. Our existing operations as well as the development of new sites also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building, and transportation requirements.  Moreover, whether at the federal, tribal, regional, state and local levels, environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including new or amended legal requirements that may arise in the future to address potential environmental concerns such as air and water impacts or to address perceived health or safety-related concerns such as oil and natural gas development in close proximity to specific occupied structures and/or certain environmentally-sensitive or recreational areas, are expected to continue to have a considerable impact on the demand for our systems and services.

 
  12
 

 These environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations generally restrict the level of pollutants emitted to ambient air, discharges to surface water, and disposals or other releases to surface and below-ground soils and ground water. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area. In particular, under certain circumstances, environmental agencies may delay or refuse to grant required approvals or cancel or amend existing permits or leases that may relate to our customers' operations, in which event such operations may be interrupted or suspended for varying lengths of time, causing a reduced demand for our systems and services, an associated loss of revenue to us and adversely affecting our results of operations in support of those customers  Additionally, multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits, which allow private parties, including environmental organizations, to act in place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law. See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K/A for further discussion on environmental laws and regulations, including with respect to hydraulic fracturing; induced seismicity regulatory developments; ozone standards, site remediation; climate change, including methane or other GHG emissions; and other regulations relating to environmental protection. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor determinable as existing standards are subject to change and new standards or more stringent enforcement programs continue to evolve.
 We have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions on activities that may affect the environment and, thus, any new laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement that result in more stringent and costly pollution control equipment, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting or performance of projects, or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results.  It is possible that other developments, such as stricter and more comprehensive environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, claims for personal injuries to persons or damages to natural resources and property, or disruption of our customers' operations resulting from our actions or omissions, and imposition of penalties due to our operations could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.
 Intellectual Property
 We continuously seek to innovate our product and service offerings to improve our operations and deliver increased value to our customers. Our engineering team is focused on continuing to enhance the capabilities of our systems, increase our product and service offerings and improve our manufacturing operations. In addition, our software team is constantly designing and building increased software capabilities to enable efficient supply chain planning and management for our customers. We believe our investment in research and development will result in the development of complementary products and services, which will provide a competitive advantage as our customers focus on extracting oil and natural gas in the most economical and efficient ways possible.
 We seek patent and trademark protections for our technology when we deem it prudent, and we aggressively pursue protection of these rights. We believe our patents, trademarks, and other protections for our proprietary technologies are adequate for the conduct of our business and that no single patent or trademark is critical to our business. In addition, we rely to a great extent on the technical expertise and know-how of our personnel to maintain our competitive position, and we take commercially reasonable measures to protect trade secrets and other confidential and/or proprietary information relating to the technologies we develop.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had two issued patents in the United States and corollary patents issued in Canada and Mexico; four utility patent applications in the United States, one of which has been allowed, three corollary patents that have been issued in Canada, and one provisional patent application in the United States, each patent and patent application relates to our systems and services and other technologies. Our issued patents expire, if all of the maintenance fees are paid, between 2032 and 2033. We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. In addition, any patents may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them.

 Properties and Insurance
 Our principal properties are described above under the captions "— Manufacturing" and "—Kingfisher Facility." We believe that our properties and facility are adequate for our operations and are maintained in a good state of repair in the ordinary course of our business. However, our assets may be affected by natural or man-made disasters and other external events that may disrupt our manufacturing operations. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations. In addition, our operations are subject to, and exposed to, employee/employer liabilities and risks such as wrongful termination, discrimination, labor organizing, retaliation claims and general human resource related matters.
 Further, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in our industry. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our systems are deployed or services are performed may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.
 We believe that our insurance coverage is customary for the industry in which we operate and adequate for our business. To address the hazards inherent in our business, we maintain insurance coverage that includes first-party physical damage coverage, third-party general liability insurance, auto liability, employer's liability, environmental liability and other coverage, although coverage for environmental related losses is subject to certain limitations. However, we do not have insurance against all foreseeable risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. The occurrence of an event not fully insured against or the failure of an insurer to meet its insurance obligations could result in substantial losses. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. Insurance may not be available to cover any or all of the risks to which we are subject, or, even if available, it may be inadequate, or insurance premiums or other costs could rise significantly in the future so as to make such insurance prohibitively expensive.
 We customarily enter into MSAs with our customers that delineate our customer's and our respective indemnification obligations with respect to the systems we deploy. Generally, under our MSAs, we assume responsibility for pollution, contamination and other damage originating from any negligence or willful misconduct in our operation of the system. However, we generally do not assume responsibility for any other pollution or contamination that may occur during operations, including any pollution or contamination which may result from the actual proppant used on the well site, including pollution or contamination that may result from seepage or any other uncontrolled disbursement of proppant. While we have not received claims relating to pollution or contamination in the deployment of our systems, if we are ultimately deemed responsible, our obligations may include the control, removal and clean-up of any pollution or contamination. In such cases, we may be exposed to additional liability if we are negligent or commit willful acts causing the pollution or contamination. We routinely attempt to require and are sometime successful in requiring our customers to agree to indemnify us against claims arising from their employees' personal injury or death to the extent that their employees are injured by operating our systems, unless the loss is a result of our negligence or willful misconduct. Similarly, we generally agree to indemnify our customers for liabilities arising from personal injury to or death of any of our employees, unless resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of our customer. The same principals often apply to mutual indemnification for loss or destruction of customer-owned property or equipment, except such indemnification is not limited by negligence or misconduct. Losses due to catastrophic events are generally the responsibility of the customer. However, despite this general allocation of risk, we may be unsuccessful in enforcing contractual terms, incur an unforeseen liability that is not addressed by the scope of the contractual provisions or be required to enter into an MSA with terms that vary from our standard allocations of risk, as described above. Consequently, we may incur substantial losses above our insurance coverage that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 Legal Proceedings
 Due to the nature of our business, we may become, from time to time, involved in routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to our business activities. In the opinion of our management, there are no pending litigation, disputes or claims against us which, if decided adversely, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.
