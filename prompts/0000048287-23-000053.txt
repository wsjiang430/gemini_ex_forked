Item 1.  Business
General
HNI Corporation (the "Corporation", "we", "us", or "our") is an Iowa corporation incorporated in 1944. The Corporation is a provider of workplace furnishings and residential building products. Workplace furnishings include furniture systems, seating, storage, tables, and architectural products. These products are sold primarily through a national system of independent dealers, office product distributors, eCommerce retailers, and wholesalers but also directly to end-user customers and federal, state, and local governments. Residential building products include a full array of gas, wood, electric, and pellet-fueled fireplaces, inserts, stoves, facings, outdoor fire pits and fire tables, and accessories. These products are sold through a national system of independent dealers and distributors, as well as Corporation-owned installing distribution and retail outlets. In fiscal 2022, the Corporation had net sales of $2.4 billion, of which $1.5 billion or 63 percent was attributable to the workplace furnishings segment and $0.9 billion or 37 percent was attributable to the residential building products segment.
The Corporation is organized into a corporate headquarters and operating units with offices, manufacturing plants, distribution centers, and sales showrooms primarily in the United States, India, and Mexico. See "Item 2. Properties" for additional related discussion.
For further information with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, operating segment information, and the Corporation’s operations in general, refer to "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II of this report and the following sections in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: "Note 1. Nature of Operations", "Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures", and "Note 16. Reportable Segment Information".
Markets
The Corporation competes in the workplace furnishings and residential building products markets principally by providing compelling value products designed to be among the best in their price range for product quality and performance, along with superior customer service and short lead-times. This is made possible, in part, by the Corporation’s ongoing investment in its brands, research and development efforts, efficient manufacturing operations, and extensive distribution network.
Workplace Furnishings
The North American workplace furnishings market consists of two primary channels — the contract channel and the small and medium-sized business ("SMB") channel. The primary end-users for both channels are business customers.
The contract channel has traditionally been characterized by sales of office furniture and services to large corporations, primarily for new office facilities, relocations, and/or office redesigns. Sales made through the contract channel are frequently customized to meet specific client and architect/designer preferences. End users generally purchase through independent office furniture dealers who prepare a custom-designed office layout emphasizing image and design. The selling process is complex, lengthy, and generally has several manufacturers competing for the same projects.
The SMB channel, in which the Corporation is a market leader, primarily represents smaller orders of office furniture that are less likely to involve an architect and/or designer. Sales in this channel are driven on the basis of price, product quality, selection, and the speed and reliability of delivery. Independent dealers, national office product distributors, eCommerce retailers, and wholesalers are the primary distribution channels in this market.
The workplace furnishings industry is highly competitive, with a significant number of competitors offering similar products. The Corporation competes by emphasizing its ability to deliver compelling value products, solutions, and a high level of tailored customer service. The Corporation competes with large workplace furnishings manufacturers, which cover a substantial portion of the North America market share in the workplace furnishings market. Competitors include manufacturers such as MillerKnoll, Inc., Steelcase, Inc., Haworth, Inc., The Global Group, Kimball International, Inc., Krueger International, Inc., and Teknion Corporation, as well as global importers. The Corporation faces significant price competition from its competitors and may encounter competition from new market entrants.
Residential Building Products
The Corporation also competes in the residential building products industry, where it is the market leader in hearth products. Hearth products are typically purchased by builders during the construction of new homes and homeowners during the renovation 
of existing homes. Both types of purchases involve seasonality with remodel/retrofit activity being particularly concentrated in the September to December timeframe. Distribution is primarily through independent and company-owned installing distributors and retail outlets.
The hearth products market is highly competitive, with products manufactured by a number of national and regional competitors. The Corporation competes against a broad range of manufacturers, including Travis Industries, Inc., Innovative Hearth Products, Wolf Steel Ltd. (Napoleon), and FPI Fireplace Products International Ltd. (Regency).
Strategy
The Corporation’s strategy is to build on its position as a leading manufacturer of workplace furnishings and residential building products.
The foundation of the Corporation’s strategy continues to be its distinct member-owner culture, which has enabled HNI to attract, develop, retain, and motivate skilled, experienced, and efficient member-owners (i.e., employees), and which drives a unique level of commitment to the Corporation’s success. The Corporation aims to leverage this culture to enable profitable growth by focusing members’ efforts on the following three pillars:
•Customer-First Mindset (focus on the customer) – The journeys customers take buying and using workplace furnishings and residential building products continue to rapidly evolve — presenting new opportunities to better serve them. The key to capitalizing on these changes is a deep understanding of customers. To that end, the Corporation continues to broaden its involvement in and understanding of the entire customer journey, by investing in data analytics, digital assets, branding, eCommerce capabilities, and market coverage. This customer-first mindset will allow the Corporation to identify and take advantage of new and developing market dynamics.
•Effortless Winning Experiences (simplify the buying process) – Customers continue to raise their expectations and demand more effortless experiences. Buying office furniture and hearth products can be complicated and time-consuming. The Corporation’s deep understanding of the customer buying journey incorporates technology and digital assets to help customers navigate the buying process more quickly and with reduced effort. The Corporation has scale, price point breadth, product depth, and resources to lead this charge.
•Own Operational Excellence (leverage lean heritage) – All HNI member-owners embrace the principles of lean manufacturing. Members utilize Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI), which scrutinizes every facet of the business to identify areas of waste, and then refine and streamline. RCI can be seen in action throughout the Corporation’s value chain from the manufacturing floor to the administrative offices to customer interactions, as members always look to find a better, more efficient, and more environmentally-friendly approach. This focus on RCI benefits stakeholders as the Corporation consistently delivers productivity and cost savings that allow it to grow earnings and invest in the future. 
Management believes that the skillful execution of these strategic initiatives will support robust organic sales growth, margin expansion, improved returns, strong free cash flow, and position the Corporation for continued success.

The Corporation sells its products through various distribution channels. A summary of each channel is as follows:
•Independent, local office products dealers that specialize in the sale of office furniture and/or office products to business, government, education, and health care entities.
•National office product distributors that sell furniture and office supplies through a national network of dealerships and sales offices. These distributors also sell through on-line and retail office products stores.
•eCommerce focused resellers that sell a wide array of business and consumer products to commercial and non-commercial customers. Orders are fulfilled both by the Corporation and/or directly by the eCommerce reseller from inventory held in their facilities.
•Wholesalers that serve as distributors of the Corporation’s products to independent dealers and national office products distributors. These wholesalers maintain inventories of standard product lines for quick delivery to customers.
•Direct sales of products to federal, state, and local government offices, or in certain circumstances a lead selling relationship with an end-user.
The Corporation’s workplace furnishings sales force consists of sales managers, salespeople, and independent manufacturers’ representatives who collectively provide national sales coverage. Sales managers and salespeople are compensated by a combination of salary and variable performance compensation.
The Corporation also makes export sales through HNI International to independent office furniture dealers and wholesale distributors serving select foreign markets. Distributors are principally located in the Caribbean, Latin America, and Mexico. Through HNI India, the Corporation manufactures and distributes office furniture directly to end-users and through independent dealers and distributors primarily in India.
Residential Building Products
The Corporation’s residential building products segment includes the Hearth & Home Technologies LLC ("Hearth & Home") operating unit. Hearth & Home is North America’s largest manufacturer and marketer of prefabricated fireplaces, hearth stoves, and related products. These products are primarily for the home and are sold under the following widely recognized brands:
Heatilator®
Heat & Glo®
Majestic®
Monessen®
Quadra-Fire®
Harman®

Vermont Castings®
PelPro®
StellarTM
SimpliFire®
The Outdoor GreatRoom Company®


The Corporation’s line of hearth products includes a full array of gas, wood, electric, and pellet-fueled fireplaces, inserts, stoves, facings, outdoor fire pits and fire tables, and accessories. Heatilator®, Heat & Glo®, Majestic®, Monessen®, and StellarTM are brand leaders in the two largest segments of the home fireplace market: gas and wood fireplaces. The Corporation is a leader in "direct vent" fireplaces, which replaces the chimney-venting system used in traditional fireplaces with a less expensive vent through the roof or an outer wall. In addition, the Corporation is a market leader in wood and pellet-burning stoves with its Quadra-Fire®, Harman®, Vermont Castings®, and PelPro® product lines, which provide home heating solutions using renewable fuels. 
Hearth & Home sells its products through independent dealers, distributors, and 29 Corporation-owned installing distribution and retail outlets. The distribution and retail brand of this operating unit is Fireside Hearth & Home. The Corporation has a field sales organization of sales managers, salespeople, and independent manufacturers’ representatives.
Largest Customers
In fiscal 2022, the Corporation’s five largest customers represented approximately 18 percent of its consolidated net sales. No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the Corporation’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022, and management 
does not consider the Corporation’s operations or financial performance to be dependent on any individual customer. The substantial purchasing power exercised by large customers may adversely affect the prices at which the Corporation can successfully offer its products.
Resources
Manufacturing
The Corporation manufactures workplace furnishings in Georgia, Iowa, New York, North Carolina, India, and Mexico. The Corporation manufactures hearth products in Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.
The Corporation purchases raw materials, components, and finished goods from a variety of suppliers, and most items are generally available from multiple sources. Major raw materials include coil steel, aluminum, zinc, lumber, veneer, particleboard, textiles, paint, hardware, glass, plastic products, packaging, foam, and fiberglass.
Since its inception, the Corporation has focused on making its manufacturing facilities and processes more flexible while reducing cost, eliminating waste, and improving product quality. The Corporation applies the principles of RCI and a lean manufacturing philosophy leveraging the creativity of its members to reduce and/or eliminate costs. The application of RCI has increased productivity by reducing set-up, processing times, square footage, inventory levels, product costs, and delivery times, while improving quality and enhancing member safety. The Corporation’s RCI process involves members, customers, and suppliers. Manufacturing also plays a key role in the Corporation’s concurrent research and development process in order to design new products for ease of manufacturability.
Research and Development
The Corporation’s research and development efforts are primarily focused on developing relevant and differentiated end-user solutions focused on quality, aesthetics, style, sustainable design, and reduced manufacturing costs. The Corporation accomplishes this through improving existing products, extending product lines, applying ergonomic research, improving manufacturing processes, and leveraging alternative materials. The Corporation conducts its research and development efforts at both the corporate and operating unit levels. See "Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for amounts that the Corporation has invested in research and development. 
Intellectual Property
As of December 31, 2022, the Corporation owned 83 United States and 76 foreign patents with expiration dates through 2042 and had applications pending for 26 United States and 14 foreign patents. In addition, the Corporation holds 168 United States and 323 foreign trademark registrations and has applications pending for 19 United States and 5 foreign trademarks. The Corporation believes neither any individual workplace furnishings patent nor the Corporation’s workplace furnishings patents in the aggregate are material to the Corporation’s business as a whole. The Corporation’s patents covering its residential building products protect various technical innovations. While the acquisition of patents reflects Hearth & Home’s position in the market as an innovation leader, the Corporation believes neither any individual residential building product patent nor the Corporation’s residential building product patents in the aggregate are material to the Corporation’s business as a whole.
The Corporation applies for patent protection when it believes the expense of doing so is justified and the duration of its registered patents is adequate to protect these rights. The Corporation also pays royalties in certain instances for the use of patents on products and processes owned by others.
The Corporation applies for trademark protection for brands and products when it believes the expense of doing so is justified. The Corporation actively protects trademarks it believes have significant value. The Corporation believes neither the loss of any individual trademark nor the loss of the Corporation’s trademarks in the aggregate would materially or adversely affect the Corporation’s business as a whole, except for HON®, Allsteel®, Heat & Glo®, and Heatilator®.
Environmental Regulations and Sustainability
The Corporation is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing the use of materials and substances in products, the management of wastes resulting from use of certain material, the emission of pollutants from its operations, and the remediation of contamination associated with past releases of hazardous substances. Although the Corporation believes it is compliant with the various regulations applicable to its business, there can be no assurance requirements will not change in the future or the Corporation will not incur material costs to comply with such regulations. The Corporation has trained staff responsible for monitoring compliance with environmental, health, and safety requirements. The Corporation’s staff works with responsible personnel at each manufacturing facility, the Corporation’s legal counsel, and consultants on the management of 
environmental, health, and safety issues. The Corporation’s environmental objective is to reduce and, when practical, eliminate the human and ecosystem impacts of materials and manufacturing processes.
Compliance with federal, state, and local environmental regulations has not had a material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Corporation to date and is not expected to have material effect in the near future. However, there is no assurance environmental requirements or technology will not change or the Corporation will not incur material costs to comply with such regulations.
The Corporation has expanded its Corporate Social Responsibility commitment and has become a signatory to the UN Global Compact, joined RE100, committed to 100 percent renewable electricity annually by 2030, and set aggressive science-based carbon emission reduction goals aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement. To support these goals, the Corporation has established metrics to divert waste from landfill, reduce energy use, and lower greenhouse gas emissions from its operations. The Corporation also committed to reducing the impacts of its products through evaluations of design and development, suppliers, and supply chain performance. Integrating these sustainable objectives into core business systems is consistent with the Corporation’s vision, ensures its commitment to being a sustainable enterprise, and remains a priority for members.
