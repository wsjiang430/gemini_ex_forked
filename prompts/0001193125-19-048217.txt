 Description of Business 
 Landstar is a worldwide asset-light provider of integrated transportation management solutions. The Company offers services to its customers across multiple transportation modes, with the ability to arrange for individual shipments of freight to enterprise-wide solutions to manage all of a customers transportation needs. Landstar provides services principally throughout the United States and to a lesser extent in Canada and Mexico, and between the United States and Canada, Mexico and other countries around the world. The Companys services emphasize safety, information coordination and customer service and are delivered through a network of over 1,200 independent commission sales agents and over 68,000 third party capacity providers, primarily truck capacity providers, linked together by a series of technological applications which are provided and coordinated by the Company. 
 Landstar markets its integrated transportation management solutions primarily through independent commission sales agents and exclusively utilizes third party capacity providers to transport customers freight. Landstars independent commission sales agents enter into contractual arrangements with the Company and are responsible for locating freight, making that freight available to Landstars capacity providers and coordinating the transportation of the freight with customers and capacity providers. The Companys third party capacity providers consist of independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the Company under exclusive lease arrangements (the BCO Independent Contractors), unrelated trucking companies who provide truck capacity to the Company under non-exclusive contractual arrangements (the Truck Brokerage Carriers), air cargo carriers, ocean cargo carriers and railroads. Through this network of agents and capacity providers linked together by Landstars information technology systems, Landstar operates an integrated transportation management solutions business primarily throughout North America with revenue of $4.6 billion during the most recently completed fiscal year. The nature of the Companys business is such that a significant portion of its operating costs varies directly with revenue. The Company reports the results of two operating segments: the transportation logistics segment and the insurance segment.

 Transportation Logistics Segment 
 The transportation logistics segment provides a wide range of integrated transportation management solutions. Transportation services offered by the Company include truckload and less-than-truckload transportation, rail intermodal, air cargo, ocean cargo, expedited ground and air delivery of time-critical freight, heavy-haul/specialized, U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico cross-border, intra-Mexico, intra-Canada, project cargo and customs brokerage. Examples of the industries serviced by the transportation logistics segment include automotive products, building products, metals, chemicals, foodstuffs, heavy machinery, retail, electronics and military equipment. In addition, the transportation logistics segment provides transportation services to other transportation companies, including third party logistics and less-than-truckload service providers. Each of the independent commission sales agents has the opportunity to market all of the services provided by the transportation logistics segment. Billings for freight transportation services are typically charged to customers on a per shipment basis for the physical transportation of freight and are referred to as transportation revenue. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the amount of revenue from external customers, measure of profit and total assets attributable to the transportation logistics segment for the last three fiscal years. 
 Truck Services. The transportation logistics segments truck transportation services include a full array of truckload transportation for a wide range of commodities and, to a lesser degree, less-than-truckload transportation services. A significant portion of the Companys truckload services are delivered in the spot market over irregular or non-repetitive routes, while approximately 30% of the Companys fiscal year 2018 truck transportation revenue was provided utilizing Landstar provided trailing equipment, which frequently are used on more routine, regular routes. The Company utilizes a broad assortment of equipment, including dry and specialty vans of various sizes, unsided/platform trailers (including flatbeds, drop decks and specialty trailers), temperature-controlled vans and containers. Available truck transportation services also include short-to-long haul movement of containers by truck and expedited ground and dedicated power-only truck capacity. During fiscal year 2018, revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors and Truck Brokerage Carriers was 43% and 49%, respectively, of consolidated revenue. Also, during fiscal year 2018, truck transportation revenue generated via van equipment and unsided/platform trailing equipment was 65% and 32%, respectively, of truck transportation revenue and less-than-truckload revenue was 2% of truck transportation revenue. The Companys truck services contributed 93% of consolidated revenue in each of fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
 Landstar Metro provides freight and logistics services within the country of Mexico and in conjunction with Landstars U.S./Mexico cross-border services. Landstar Servicios provides various administrative, financial, operational, safety and compliance services to Landstar Metro. The results of operations from Landstar Metro and Landstar Servicios are presented as part of the Companys transportation logistics segment. Revenue from Landstar Metro represented less than 1% of the Companys transportation logistics segment revenue in fiscal year 2018. 
 Rail Intermodal Services. The transportation logistics segment has contracts with Class 1 domestic and Canadian railroads, certain short-line railroads and most major asset-based intermodal equipment providers, including agreements with stacktrain operators and container and trailing equipment companies. In addition, the transportation logistics segment has contracts with a vast network of local trucking companies that handle pick-up and delivery of rail freight. These contracts provide the transportation logistics segment the ability to transport freight via rail throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The transportation logistics segments rail intermodal service capabilities include trailer on flat car, container on flat car, box car and railcar. The transportation logistics segments rail intermodal services contributed 3% of consolidated revenue in each of fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
 Air and Ocean Services. The transportation logistics segment provides domestic and international air services and ocean services to its customers. The Company executes international air freight transportation as an International Air Transport Association (IATA) certified Indirect Air Carrier (IAC) and international ocean freight transportation as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary (OTI) licensed by the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) as a non-vessel operating common carrier (NVOCC) and ocean freight forwarder. Through its network of independent commission sales agents, relationships within a global network of foreign freight forwarders and contracts with a number of airlines and ocean lines, the transportation logistics segment provides efficient and cost effective door-to-door transportation to most points in the world for a vast array of cargo types such as over-sized break bulk, consolidations, full container loads, less-than container loads and refrigerated freight. The transportation logistics segments air and ocean services contributed 3% of consolidated revenue in both fiscal years 2018 and 2017 and 2% of consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2016.

 Insurance Segment 
 The insurance segment is comprised of Signature Insurance Company (Signature), a wholly owned offshore insurance subsidiary, and Risk Management Claim Services, Inc. (RMCS). The insurance segment provides risk and claims management services to certain of Landstars Operating Subsidiaries. In addition, it reinsures certain risks of the Companys BCO Independent Contractors and provides certain property and casualty insurance directly to certain of Landstars Operating Subsidiaries. Revenue at the insurance segment represents reinsurance premiums from third party insurance companies that provide insurance programs to BCO Independent Contractors where all or a portion of the risk of loss is ultimately borne by Signature. Revenue at the insurance segment represented approximately 1% of the Companys consolidated revenue in each of fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the amount of revenue from external customers, measure of profit and total assets attributable to the insurance segment for the last three fiscal years. 
Factors Significant to the Companys Operations 
 Management believes the following factors are particularly significant to the Companys operations: 
 Agent Network 
 The Companys primary day-to-day contact with its customers is through its network of independent commission sales agents and, to a lesser extent, through employees of the Company. The typical Landstar independent commission sales agent maintains a relationship with a number of shippers and services these shippers utilizing the Companys information technology systems and the various modes of transportation made available through the Companys network of third party capacity providers. The Company provides assistance to the agents in developing additional relationships with shippers and enhancing agent and Company relationships with larger shippers through the Companys field employees, located throughout the United States and Canada. The Operating Subsidiaries provide programs to support the agents operations and provide guidance on establishing pricing parameters for freight hauled by the various modes of transportation available to the agents. It is important to note that the Operating Subsidiaries, and not the Companys agents, contract directly with customers and generally assume the related credit risk and potential liability for freight losses or damages when the Company is providing transportation services as a motor carrier. 
 Management believes the Company has more independent commission sales agents than any other asset-light integrated transportation management solutions company in the United States. Landstars vast network of independent commission sales agent locations provides the Company regular contact with shippers at the local level and the capability to be highly responsive to shippers changing needs. The Companys large fleet of available capacity provides the agent network the resources needed to service both large and small shippers. Through its agent network, the Company offers smaller shippers a level of service comparable to that typically enjoyed only by larger customers. Examples include the ability to provide transportation services on short notice, multiple pick-up and delivery points, automated information flow, access to specialized equipment, spotted van trailers and drop-and-hook operations. In addition, a number of the Companys agents specialize in certain types of freight and transportation services (such as oversized or heavy loads and/or rail, air and international freight transportation). Each independent commission sales agent has the opportunity to market all of the services provided by the transportation logistics segment. 
 The independent commission sales agents use a variety of proprietary and third party information technology applications provided by the Company to service the requirements of shippers. For truckload services, the Companys independent commission sales agents primarily use Landstar proprietary software which enables agents to enter available freight, dispatch capacity and process most administrative procedures and then communicate that information to Landstar and its capacity providers via the internet. The Companys web-based available truck information system provides a listing of available truck capacity to the Companys independent commission sales agents. The Company also offers independent commission sales agents with a variety of proprietary web-based pricing, operational and financial tools. For modes of transportation other than truckload, the independent commission sales agents utilize both proprietary and third party information technology applications provided by the Company.

 Commissions to agents are based on contractually agreed-upon percentages of revenue or net revenue, defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation, or net revenue less a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue retained by Landstar. Commissions to agents as a percentage of consolidated revenue will vary directly with fluctuations in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated by the various modes of transportation and reinsurance premiums and with changes in net revenue margin, defined as net revenue divided by revenue, on services provided by Truck Brokerage Carriers, railroads, air cargo carriers and ocean cargo carriers. Commissions to agents are recognized over the freight transit period as the performance obligation to the customer is completed. 
 The Company had 608 and 542 agents who each generated at least $1 million in Landstar revenue (the Million Dollar Agents) during fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. Landstar revenue from the Million Dollar Agents in the aggregate represented 94% and 92% of consolidated revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Annually, the Company has experienced very few terminations of its Million Dollar Agents, whether such terminations are initiated by the agent or the Company. Annual terminations of Million Dollar Agents are typically less than 3% of the total number of Million Dollar Agents. Management believes that the majority of the Million Dollar Agents choose to represent the Company exclusively. 
 Third Party Capacity 
 The Company relies exclusively on independent third parties for its hauling capacity other than for trailing equipment owned or leased by the Company and utilized primarily by the BCO Independent Contractors. These third party transportation capacity providers consist of BCO Independent Contractors, Truck Brokerage Carriers, air and ocean cargo carriers and railroads. Landstars use of capacity provided by third parties allows it to maintain a lower level of capital investment, resulting in lower fixed costs. During fiscal year 2018, revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors, Truck Brokerage Carriers and railroads represented approximately 43%, 49% and 3%, respectively, of the Companys consolidated revenue. Collectively, revenue generated by air and ocean cargo carriers represented approximately 3% of the Companys consolidated revenue during fiscal year 2018. Historically, the gross profit margin (defined as gross profit, which is defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation and commissions to agents, divided by revenue) generated from freight hauled by BCO Independent Contractors has been greater than that from freight hauled by other third party capacity providers. However, the Companys insurance and claims costs, depreciation costs and other operating costs are incurred primarily in support of BCO Independent Contractor capacity. In addition, as further described in the Corporate Services section that follows, the Company incurs significantly higher selling, general and administrative costs in support of BCO Independent Contractor capacity as compared to the other modes of transportation. Purchased transportation costs are recognized over the freight transit period as the performance obligation to the customer is completed. 
 BCO Independent Contractors. Management believes the Company has the largest fleet of truckload BCO Independent Contractors in the United States. BCO Independent Contractors provide truck capacity to the Company under exclusive lease arrangements. Each BCO Independent Contractor operates under the motor carrier operating authority issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to Landstars Operating Subsidiary to which such BCO Independent Contractor provides services and has leased his or her equipment. The Companys network of BCO Independent Contractors provides marketing, operating, safety, recruiting and retention advantages to the Company. 
 The Companys BCO Independent Contractors are compensated primarily based on a contractually agreed-upon percentage of revenue generated by loads they haul. This percentage generally ranges from 62% to 74% where the BCO Independent Contractor provides only a tractor and 73% to 78% where the BCO Independent Contractor provides both a tractor and trailing equipment. The BCO Independent Contractor must pay substantially all of the expenses of operating his/her equipment, including driver wages and benefits, fuel, physical damage insurance, maintenance, highway use taxes and debt service, if applicable. The Company passes 100% of fuel surcharges billed to customers for freight hauled by BCO Independent Contractors to its BCO Independent Contractors. During fiscal year 2018, the Company billed customers $241.7 million in fuel surcharges and passed 100% of such fuel surcharges to the BCO Independent Contractors. These fuel surcharges are excluded from revenue and the cost of purchased transportation. 
 The Company maintains internet-based applications for mobile and desktop devices through which BCO Independent Contractors can view a comprehensive listing of the Companys available freight, allowing them to consider rate, size, origin and destination when planning trips. The Landstar Contractors Advantage Purchasing Program (LCAPP) leverages Landstars purchasing power to provide discounts to eligible BCO Independent Contractors when they purchase equipment, fuel, tires and other items. In addition, Landstar Contractor Financing, Inc. provides a source of funds at competitive interest rates to the BCO Independent Contractors to purchase trailing equipment.

 The number of trucks provided to the Company by BCO Independent Contractors was 10,599 at December 29, 2018, compared to 9,696 at December 30, 2017. At December 29, 2018, approximately 97% of the trucks provided by BCO Independent Contractors were provided by BCO Independent Contractors who provided five or fewer trucks to the Company. The number of trucks provided by BCO Independent Contractors fluctuates daily as a result of truck recruiting and truck terminations. More trucks were recruited in fiscal year 2018 than in fiscal year 2017 and trucks terminated were lower in fiscal year 2018 than in fiscal year 2017, resulting in an overall net increase of 903 trucks during fiscal year 2018. Landstars BCO Independent Contractor truck turnover was approximately 24% in fiscal year 2018 compared to 31% in fiscal year 2017. Approximately 44% of 2018 turnover was attributable to BCO Independent Contractors who had been with the Company for less than one year. Management believes that factors that have historically favorably impacted turnover include the Companys extensive agent network, the quality of available freight, the Companys programs to reduce the operating costs of its BCO Independent Contractors and Landstars reputation for quality, service, reliability and financial strength. 
 Truck Brokerage Carriers. At December 29, 2018, the Company maintained a database of over 59,000 approved Truck Brokerage Carriers who provide truck capacity to the Company. Truck Brokerage Carriers provide truck capacity to the Company under non-exclusive contractual arrangements and each operates under its own DOT-issued motor carrier operating authority. Truck Brokerage Carriers are paid either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or, to a lesser extent, a contractually agreed-upon fixed rate per load. The Company recruits, approves, establishes contracts with and tracks safety ratings and service records of these third party trucking companies. In addition to providing additional capacity to the Company, the use of Truck Brokerage Carriers enables the Company to pursue different types and quality of freight such as temperature-controlled, short-haul traffic and less-than-truckload and, in certain instances, lower-priced freight that generally would not be handled by the Companys BCO Independent Contractors. 
 The Company maintains an internet site through which Truck Brokerage Carriers can view a listing of the Companys freight that is available to them. The Landstar Savings Plus Program leverages Landstars purchasing power to provide discounts to eligible Truck Brokerage Carriers when they purchase fuel and equipment and provides the Truck Brokerage Carriers with an electronic payment option. 
 Railroads and Air and Ocean Cargo Carriers. The Company has contracts with Class 1 domestic and Canadian railroads, certain short-line railroads and domestic and international airlines and ocean lines. These relationships allow the Company to pursue the freight best serviced by these forms of transportation capacity. Railroads are paid either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or a contractually agreed-upon fixed rate per load. Air cargo carriers are generally paid a negotiated rate for each load hauled. Ocean cargo carriers are generally paid contractually agreed-upon fixed rates per load. The Company also contracts with other third party capacity providers, such as air charter service providers, when required by specific customer needs. 
Trailing Equipment 
 The Company offers its customers a large and diverse fleet of trailing equipment. The following table illustrates the mix of the trailing equipment as of December 29, 2018, either provided by the BCO Independent Contractors or owned or leased by the Company and made available primarily to BCO Independent Contractors. In general, Truck Brokerage Carriers utilize their own trailing equipment when providing transportation services on behalf of Landstar. Truck Brokerage Carrier trailing equipment is not included in the following table: 

Trailers by Type | 
Van | 13,502
Unsided/platform, including flatbeds, step decks, drop decks and low boys | 3,109 
Temperature-controlled | 132 
Total | 16,743

 Specialized services offered by the Company include those provided by a large fleet of flatbed trailers and multi-axle trailers capable of hauling extremely heavy or oversized loads. Management believes the Company, along with its network of capacity providers, offers one of the largest fleets of heavy/specialized trailing equipment in North America. 
 At December 29, 2018, 12,280 of the trailers available to the BCO Independent Contractors were owned by the Company and 377 were leased. In addition, at December 29, 2018, 4,086 trailers were provided by the BCO Independent Contractors. Approximately 30% of Landstars truck transportation revenue was generated on Landstar provided trailing equipment during fiscal year 2018.

 Customers 
 The Companys customer base is highly diversified and dispersed across many industries, commodities and geographic regions. The Companys top 100 customers accounted for approximately 43% and 42%, respectively, of consolidated revenue during fiscal years 2018 and 2017. Management believes that the Companys overall size, mobile and digital applications, geographic coverage, access to equipment and diverse service capability offer the Company significant competitive marketing and operating advantages. These advantages allow the Company to meet the needs of even the largest shippers. Larger shippers often consider reducing the number of authorized carriers they use in favor of a small number of core carriers, such as the Company, whose size and diverse service capabilities enable these core carriers to satisfy most of the shippers transportation needs. The Companys national account customers include the United States Department of Defense and many of the companies included in the Fortune 500. Large shippers are also using third party logistics providers (3PLs) to outsource the management and coordination of their transportation needs. 3PLs and other transportation companies also utilize the Companys available transportation capacity to satisfy their obligations to their shippers. There were ten transportation service providers, including 3PLs, included in the Companys top 25 customers for fiscal year 2018. Management believes the Companys network of agents and third party capacity providers allows it to efficiently attract and service smaller shippers which may not be as desirable to other large transportation providers (see above under Agent Network). No customer accounted for more than 4% of the Companys 2018 revenue. 
Technology 
 Management believes leadership in the development, operation and support of mobile and digital software applications is an ongoing part of providing high quality service. Landstar focuses on providing integrated transportation management solutions which emphasize customer service and information coordination among its independent commission sales agents, customers, capacity providers and employees. The Company continues to focus on identifying, purchasing or developing and implementing software applications and tools which are designed to: (i) assist Landstar independent commission sales agents in efficiently sourcing capacity, pricing transportation services and managing and analyzing their independent businesses, (ii) assist customers in meeting their transportation needs, (iii) assist our third party capacity providers in identifying desirable freight opportunities and operating their independent businesses, and (iv) improve operational and administrative efficiency throughout the Company. Landstar intends to continue to improve its technologies to meet the total needs of its agents, customers and third party capacity providers and remains engaged in various multi-year projects aimed at increasing efficiencies, primarily through technology, at Landstar and across our agent and third party capacity network. 
 The Companys information technology systems used in connection with its operations are located in Jacksonville, Florida and, to a lesser extent, in Rockford, Illinois. In addition, the Company utilizes several third party data centers throughout the U.S. Landstar relies, in the regular course of its business, on the proper operation of its information technology systems. 
 Corporate Services 
 The Company provides many administrative support services to its network of independent commission sales agents, third party capacity providers and customers. Management believes that the mobile and digital applications purchased or developed and maintained by the Company and its administrative support services provide operational and financial advantages to its independent commission sales agents, third party capacity providers and customers. These, in turn, enhance the operational and financial efficiency of all aspects of the network. 
 Administrative support services that provide operational and financial advantages to the network include customer contract administration, customer credit review and approvals, pricing, customer billing, accounts receivable collections, third party capacity settlement, operator and equipment safety and compliance management for our network of BCO Independent Contractors, insurance claims handling, coordination of vendor discount programs and third party capacity sourcing programs. Marketing and advertising strategies are also provided by the Company. The Companys practices of accepting customer credit risk and paying its agents and carriers promptly provides a significant competitive advantage to the Company in comparison to less capitalized competitors. 
 Competition 
 Landstar competes primarily in the transportation and logistics services industry with truckload carriers, third party logistics companies, digital freight matching companies, intermodal transportation and logistics service providers, railroads, less-than-truckload carriers and other asset-light transportation and logistics service providers. The transportation and logistics services industry is extremely competitive and fragmented. 
 
8 


 Management believes that competition for freight transported by the Company is based on service, efficiency and freight rates, which are influenced significantly by the economic environment, particularly the amount of available transportation capacity and freight demand. Management believes that Landstars overall size, service offerings and availability of a wide range of equipment, together with its geographically dispersed local independent agent network, present the Company with significant competitive advantages over many transportation and logistics service providers. 
 Self-Insured Claims 
 Potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable. For commercial trucking claims, Landstar retains liability up to $5,000,000 per occurrence. In addition, for commercial trucking claims exceeding its $5,000,000 per occurrence self-insured retention, the Company retains liability up to an additional $700,000 in the aggregate on any claims incurred on or after May 1, 2016 through April 30, 2017, up to an additional $500,000 in the aggregate on any claims incurred on or after May 1, 2017 through April 30, 2018 and up to an additional $350,000 in the aggregate on any claims incurred on or after May 1, 2018 through April 30, 2019. The Company also retains liability of up to $1,000,000 for each general liability claim, up to $250,000 for each workers compensation claim and up to $250,000 for each cargo claim. The Companys exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by Truck Brokerage Carriers, railroads and air and ocean cargo carriers who transport freight on behalf of the Company is reduced by various factors including the extent to which such carriers maintain their own insurance coverage. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, cargo claims or workers compensation claims or the material unfavorable development of existing claims could have a material adverse effect on Landstars cost of insurance and claims and its results of operations. 
 Regulation 
 Certain of the Operating Subsidiaries are considered motor carriers and/or brokers authorized to arrange for transportation services by motor carriers which are regulated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (the FMCSA) and by various state agencies. The FMCSA has broad regulatory powers with respect to activities such as motor carrier operations, practices, periodic financial reporting and insurance. Subject to federal and state regulatory authorities or regulation, the Companys capacity providers may transport most types of freight to and from any point in the United States over any route selected. 
 Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the FMCSA. Each truck operator, whether working as a BCO Independent Contractor or for a Truck Brokerage Carrier, is required to have a commercial drivers license and may be subject to mandatory drug and alcohol testing. The FMCSAs commercial drivers license and drug and alcohol testing requirements have not adversely affected the Companys ability to source the capacity necessary to meet its customers transportation needs. In addition, FMCSA mandated the use of electronic logging devices (ELDs) in certain over-the-road commercial motor vehicles effective December 18, 2017. The FMCSAs ELD mandate has not adversely affected the size of the Companys fleet of BCO Independent Contractors or its ability to source truck capacity provided by Truck Brokerage Carriers. 
 In addition, certain of the Operating Subsidiaries are licensed as Ocean Transportation Intermediaries by the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission as non-vessel-operating common carriers and/or as ocean freight forwarders. The Companys air transportation activities in the United States are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation as an indirect air carrier. One of the Operating Subsidiaries is licensed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security through the Bureau of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (U.S. Customs) as a customs broker. The Company is also subject to regulations and requirements relating to safety and security promulgated by, among others, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security through U.S. Customs and the Transportation Security Administration, the Canada Border Services Agency and various state and local agencies and port authorities. In addition, because the U.S. government is one of the Companys customers, the Company must comply with and is affected by laws and regulations relating to doing business with the federal government. 
 The transportation industry is subject to other potential regulatory and legislative changes (such as the possibility of more stringent environmental, climate change and/or safety/security regulations, limits on vehicle weight and size and regulations relating to sleep apnea and, more generally, the health and wellness of commercial truck operators) that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices, by changing the demand for motor carrier services or the cost of providing truckload or other transportation or logistics services, or by adversely impacting the number of available commercial truck operators.

 Seasonality 
 Landstars operations are subject to seasonal trends common to the trucking industry. Truckload volumes for the quarter ending in March are typically lower than for the quarters ending in June, September and December. 
Employees 
 As of December 29, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries employed 1,306 individuals. Four Landstar Ranger drivers (out of a Company total of approximately 10,599 drivers for BCO Independent Contractors) are members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The Company considers relations with its employees to be good. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors
Increased severity or frequency of accidents and other claims or a material unfavorable development of existing claims. As noted above in Item 1, Business  Factors Significant to the Companys Operations  Self-Insured Claims, potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable. For commercial trucking claims, Landstar retains liability up to $5,000,000 per occurrence. In addition, for commercial trucking claims exceeding its $5,000,000 per occurrence self-insured retention, the Company retains liability up to an additional $700,000 in the aggregate on any claims incurred on or after May 1, 2016 through April 30, 2017, up to an additional $500,000 in the aggregate on any claims incurred on or after May 1, 2017 through April 30, 2018 and up to an additional $350,000 in the aggregate on any claims incurred on or after May 1, 2018 through April 30, 2019. The Company also retains liability of up to $1,000,000 for each general liability claim, up to $250,000 for each workers compensation claim and up to $250,000 for each cargo claim. The Companys exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by Truck Brokerage Carriers, railroads and air and ocean cargo carriers who transport freight on behalf of the Company is reduced by various factors including the extent to which such carriers maintain their own insurance coverage. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, cargo claims or workers compensation claims or the material unfavorable development of existing claims could have a material adverse effect on Landstars cost of insurance and claims and its results of operations. 
 Dependence on third party insurance companies. The Company is dependent on a limited number of third party insurance companies to provide insurance coverage in excess of its self-insured retention amounts. Historically, the Company has maintained insurance coverage for commercial trucking claims in excess of specific per occurrence limits, up to various maximum amounts, with a limited number of third party insurance companies. In an attempt to manage the cost of insurance and claims, the Company has historically increased or decreased the level of its financial exposure to commercial trucking claims on a per occurrence basis by increasing or decreasing its level of self-insured retention based on the estimated cost differential between proposed premiums from third party insurance companies and historical losses experienced by the Company at various levels of self-insured retention. To the extent that the third party insurance companies propose increases to their premiums for coverage of commercial trucking claims, the Company may decide to pay such increased premiums or increase its financial exposure on an aggregate or per occurrence basis, including by increasing the amount of its self-insured retention. In fact, in 2016, two of the largest third party insurers providing excess coverage for commercial trucking claims in the United States announced that in light of increased severity trends related to the increase in losses attributable to unfavorable verdicts, they would no longer provide such coverage. This decision by these two third party insurers had a significant negative impact on the availability and pricing of excess coverage for commercial trucking claims in the United States. No assurances can be given that other third party insurers will not also decide to exit the market as a provider of excess coverage for commercial trucking claims in the United States, which could have a further negative effect on the availability and pricing of such coverage. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that insurance coverage from third party insurers for claims in excess of the Companys current $5 million self-insured retention will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. 
 Dependence on independent commission sales agents. As noted above in Item 1, Business  Factors Significant to the Companys Operations  Agent Network, the Company markets its services primarily through independent commission sales agents. During fiscal year 2018, 608 agents generated revenue for Landstar of at least $1 million each, or in the aggregate approximately 94% of Landstars consolidated revenue. Landstar competes with motor carriers and other third parties for the services of these independent commission sales agents. Landstar has historically experienced very limited agent turnover in the number of its Million Dollar Agents. There can be no assurances, however, that Landstar will continue to experience very limited turnover of its Million Dollar Agents in the future. Landstars contracts with its agents, including its Million Dollar Agents, are typically terminable without cause upon 10 to 30 days notice by either party and generally contain significant but not unqualified non-compete provisions limiting the ability of a former agent to compete with Landstar for a specified period of time post-termination, and other restrictive covenants. The loss of some of the Companys Million Dollar Agents and/or a significant decrease in revenue generated by Million Dollar Agents could have a material adverse effect on Landstar, including its results of operations and revenue.

 Dependence on third party capacity providers. As noted above in Item 1, Business  Factors Significant to the Companys Operations  Transportation Capacity, Landstar does not own trucks or other transportation equipment (other than trailing equipment) and relies on third party capacity providers, including BCO Independent Contractors, Truck Brokerage Carriers, railroads and air and ocean cargo carriers, to transport freight for its customers. The Company competes with motor carriers and other third parties for the services of BCO Independent Contractors and other third party capacity providers. The market for qualified truck owner-operators and other third party truck capacity providers is very competitive among motor carriers and no assurances can be given that the Company will be able to maintain or expand the number of BCO Independent Contractors or other third party truck capacity providers. Additionally, the Companys third party capacity providers other than BCO Independent Contractors can be expected, under certain circumstances, to charge higher prices to cover increased operating expenses, such as any increases in the cost of fuel, and the Companys operating income may decline without a corresponding increase in price to the customer. A significant decrease in available capacity provided by either the Companys BCO Independent Contractors or other third party capacity providers, or increased rates charged by other third party capacity providers that cannot be passed through to customers, could have a material adverse effect on Landstar, including its results of operations and revenue. 
 Decreased demand for transportation services; U.S. trade relationships. The transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical financial results as a result of slowdowns in economic activity, the business cycles of customers, and other economic factors beyond Landstars control. If a slowdown in economic activity or a downturn in the Companys customers business cycles cause a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers, the Companys operating results could be materially adversely affected. 
 In addition, Landstar hauls a significant number of shipments that have either been imported into the United States or are destined for export from the United States. Any decision by the U.S. government to adopt actions such as a border tax on imports, an increase in customs duties or tariffs, the renegotiation of U.S. trade agreements or any other action that could have a negative impact on international trade could cause a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by many Landstar customers. Any changes in tax and trade policies in the United States and corresponding actions by other countries could adversely affect our financial performance. 
 Substantial industry competition. As noted above in Item 1, Business  Factors Significant to the Companys Operations  Competition, Landstar competes primarily in the transportation and logistics services industry. This industry is extremely competitive and fragmented. Landstar competes primarily with truckload carriers, intermodal transportation service providers, railroads, less-than-truckload carriers, third party logistics companies, digital freight matching companies and other asset-light transportation and logistics service providers. Management believes that competition for the freight transported by the Company is based on service, efficiency and freight rates, which are influenced significantly by the economic environment, particularly the amount of available transportation capacity and freight demand. Historically, competition has created downward pressure on freight rates. In addition, many large shippers are using third party logistics providers (3PLs) other than the Company to outsource the management and coordination of their transportation needs rather than directly arranging for transportation services with carriers. As noted above, there were ten transportation service providers, including 3PLs, included in the Companys top 25 customers for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. Usage by large shippers of 3PLs often provides carriers, such as the Company, with a less direct relationship with the shipper and, as a result, may increase pressure on freight rates while making it more difficult for the Company to compete primarily based on service and efficiency. A decrease in freight rates could have a material adverse effect on Landstar, including its revenue and operating income. 
 Status of independent contractors. In recent years, the topic of the classification of individuals as employees or independent contractors has gained increased attention among federal and state regulators as well as the plaintiffs bar. Various legislative or regulatory proposals have been introduced at the federal and state levels that may affect the classification status of individuals as independent contractors or employees for either employment tax purposes (withholding, social security, Medicare and unemployment taxes) or other benefits available to employees (most notably, workers compensation benefits). Recently, certain states (most prominently, California) have seen significant increased activity by tax and other regulators and numerous class action lawsuits filed against transportation companies that engage independent contractors. For example, on January 25, 2019, a purported class action was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Bernardino by Hany Tanious, as an individual and on behalf of all others similarly situated, against Landstar System, Inc. and Landstar Ranger, Inc. 
 
11 


  (together, the Defendants). Mr. Tanious is a truck owner-operator and formerly an independent contractor who was a party to an independent contractor operating agreement with Landstar Ranger, Inc. The complaint asserts claims based on the alleged misclassification of Mr. Tanious as an independent contractor and alleges violations under California law relating to overtime, minimum wage, meal and rest breaks, failure to reimburse certain expenses, wage statements, waiting time and unfair competition. See Item III, Legal Proceedings for further information. 
 There are many different tests and standards that may apply to the determination of whether a relationship is that of an independent contractor or one of employment. For example, different standards may be applied by the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board, state unemployment agencies, state departments of labor, state taxing authorities, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, state discrimination or disability benefit administrators and state workers compensation boards, among others. For federal tax purposes, most individuals are classified as employees or independent contractors based on a multi-factor common-law analysis rather than any definition found in the Internal Revenue Code or Internal Revenue Service regulations. In addition, under Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978, a taxpayer that meets certain criteria may treat an individual as an independent contractor for employment tax purposes if the taxpayer has been audited without being told to treat similarly situated workers as employees, if the taxpayer has received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or a court decision affirming the taxpayers treatment of the individual as an independent contractor, or if the taxpayer is following a long-standing recognized practice. 
 The Company classifies its BCO Independent Contractors and independent commission sales agents as independent contractors for all purposes, including employment tax and employee benefits. There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, administrative or regulatory (including tax) authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations that would change the employee/independent contractor classification of BCO Independent Contractors or independent commission sales agents doing business with the Company. Although management believes that there are no proposals currently pending that would significantly change the employee/independent contractor classification of BCO Independent Contractors or independent commission sales agents currently doing business with the Company, potential changes, if any, with respect to these BCO Independent Contractor and independent commission sales agent classifications could have a material adverse effect on Landstars operating model. Further, the costs associated with any such potential changes could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition if Landstar were unable to pass through to its customers an increase in price corresponding to such increased costs. Moreover, class action litigation in this area against other transportation companies has resulted in significant damage awards and/or monetary settlements for workers who have been allegedly misclassified as independent contractors and the legal and other related expenses associated with litigating these cases can be substantial. 
 Regulatory and legislative changes. As noted above in Item 1, Business  Factors Significant to the Companys Operations  Regulation, certain of the Operating Subsidiaries are motor carriers and/or property brokers authorized to arrange for transportation services by motor carriers which are regulated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation, and by various state agencies. Certain of the Operating Subsidiaries are licensed as Ocean Transportation Intermediaries by the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission as non-vessel-operating common carriers and/or as ocean freight forwarders. The Companys air transportation activities in the United States are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation as an indirect air carrier. One of the Companys subsidiaries is licensed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security through the Bureau of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (U.S. Customs) as a customs broker. The Company is also subject to regulations and requirements relating to safety and security promulgated by, among others, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security through U.S. Customs and the Transportation Security Administration, the Canada Border Services Agency and various state and local agencies and port authorities. 
 The transportation industry is subject to other potential regulatory and legislative changes (such as the possibility of more stringent environmental, climate change and/or safety/security regulations, limits on vehicle weight and size and regulations relating to sleep apnea and, more generally, the health and wellness of commercial truck operators) that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices, by changing the demand for motor carrier services or the cost of providing truckload or other transportation or logistics services, or by adversely impacting the number of available commercial truck operators. 
 In particular, the FMCSA in recent years proposed a number of regulatory changes that affect the operation of commercial motor carriers across the United States. It is difficult to predict in what form FMCSA regulations may be implemented, modified or enforced and what impact any such regulations may have on motor carrier operations or the aggregate number of trucks that provide hauling capacity to the Company. 
 
12 


 In December 2010, the FMCSA introduced the Compliance Safety Accountability (CSA) motor carrier oversight program. The Company believes the intent of this program is to improve regulatory oversight of motor carriers and commercial drivers using a safety measurement system methodology that is fundamentally different from the methodology that the FMCSA historically relied upon. Under CSA, the FMCSA monitors seven Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories, or BASICs, under which a motor carrier may be evaluated against established threshold scores for each such BASIC. In the event a motor carrier has one or more BASIC scores that exceeds the applicable threshold, the motor carrier has an increased risk of roadside inspection and/or compliance review by FMCSA. Under the Fixing Americas Surface Transportation Act, or the FAST Act signed into law on December 4, 2015, the FMCSA was required to engage the National Research Council to conduct a study of CSA and the Safety Measurement System (SMS) utilized by the CSA program. As a result of the FAST Act, the FMCSA announced the removal of the BASIC scores from public view and that such scores are expected to remain hidden from public view while changes to CSA are considered. In 2018, the FMCSA announced significant anticipated changes to CSA that if enacted would be expected to have a material impact on the current program. No assurances can be given with respect to the changes that may be made to the CSA program, or any replacement or supplemental program, in the future and what impact a new or revised motor carrier oversight program implemented by the FMCSA could have on the Company, its motor carrier operations or the aggregate number of trucks that provide hauling capacity to the Company. 
 Regulations focused on diesel emissions and other air quality matters. Focus on diesel emissions, climate change and related air quality matters has led to efforts by federal, state and local governmental agencies to support legislation and regulations to limit the amount of carbon emissions, including emissions created by diesel engines utilized in tractors such as those operated by the Companys BCO Independent Contractors and Truck Brokerage Carriers. Moreover, federal, state and local governmental agencies may also focus on regulation in relation to trailing equipment specifications in an effort to achieve, among other things, lower carbon emissions. For example, under the federal Clean Air Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for prescribing national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for certain air pollutants, and each state is responsible for implementing those standards within its borders. Specifically, each state must adopt, and submit for the EPAs approval, a state implementation plan (SIP) that provides for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the NAAQS. In connection with its efforts to comply with the NAAQS, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) has implemented regulations that restrict the ability of certain tractors and trailers from operating in California and that impose emission standards on nearly all diesel-fueled trucks with gross vehicle weight ratings in excess of 14,000 lbs. that operate in California. In 2012, the EPA formally approved certain CARB regulations as part of Californias SIP, including CARBs Regulation to Reduce Emissions of Diesel Particulate Matter, Oxides of Nitrogen and Other Criteria Pollutants from In-Use Heavy-Duty Diesel-Fueled Vehicles (commonly referred to as the Truck and Bus Regulation) and Regulation to Reduce Emissions of Diesel Particulate Matter, Oxides of Nitrogen and Other Criteria Pollutants from In-Use Heavy-Duty Diesel-Fueled Drayage Trucks (commonly referred to as the Drayage Truck Regulation). The EPA thereafter received express authorization to enforce Californias SIP, including the Truck and Bus Regulation and the Drayage Truck Regulation. 
 In June 2016, Landstar Ranger, Inc. received an information request from the EPA to determine the Clean Air Act compliance status of Landstar Ranger, Inc. with respect to the Truck and Bus Regulation and the Drayage Truck Regulation in the state of California. Landstar Ranger, Inc. believes it complied with this information request; however, the timing and outcome of the review by the EPA and any subsequent action by the EPA, if any, cannot be predicted. The Company may incur significant legal and other professional fees in connection with the EPAs review. If the Company is found to be in noncompliance with CARB regulations, the EPA and CARB may seek to impose significant fines and penalties, or injunctive relief, on the Company. Further, the Company reorganized its entire fleet of van trailing equipment to maintain CARB-compliant trailer operations. Moreover, no assurances can be given with respect to the extent BCO Independent Contractors will choose to become CARB-compliant by purchasing a new or used CARB-compliant tractor, replacing the engine in their existing tractor with a CARB-compliant engine or performing an exhaust retrofit of their existing tractor by installing a particulate matter filter. Accordingly, many of the Companys BCO Independent Contractors may choose not to haul loads that would require travel within California, which could affect the ability of the Company to service customer freight needs for freight originating from, delivering to or traveling through California. Furthermore, increased regulation of tractor or trailing equipment specifications, including emissions created by diesel engines, could create substantial costs for the Companys third party capacity providers and, in turn, increase the cost of purchased transportation to the Company. An increase in the costs to purchase, lease or maintain tractor or trailing equipment or in purchased transportation cost caused by existing or new regulations without a corresponding increase in price to the customer could adversely affect Landstar, including its results of operations and financial condition.

 Disruptions or failures in the Companys computer systems; cyber and other information security incidents. As noted above in Item 1, Business  Factors Significant to the Companys Operations  Technology, the Companys information technology systems used in connection with its operations are located in Jacksonville, Florida and to a lesser extent in Rockford, Illinois. In addition, the Company utilizes several third party data centers throughout the U.S. Landstar relies, in the regular course of its business, on the proper operation of its information technology systems to link its extensive network of customers, agents and third party capacity providers, including its BCO Independent Contractors. Although the Company has redundant systems for its critical operations, any significant disruption or failure of its technology systems or those of third party data centers on which it relies could significantly disrupt the Companys operations and impose significant costs on the Company. Moreover, it is critical that the data processed by or stored in the Companys information technology systems or otherwise in the Companys possession remain confidential, as it often includes confidential, proprietary and/or competitively sensitive information regarding our customers, agents and third party capacity providers, employee records and key financial and operational results and statistics. Cyber incidents that impact the security, availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of these systems and data, including outages, computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions, could have a significant impact on our operations. Accordingly, information security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. Although we believe that we have robust security procedures and other safeguards in place, as threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. For example, in the first quarter of 2016, we were subject to spear-phishing attacks through which third parties were able to obtain personal employee data. We have undertaken a number of remedial measures in response, including enhancing our security systems and additional training for our employees. Additional incidents may occur in the future and may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. A significant incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware, or other damage, could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, agents and/or third party capacity providers, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation, and/or cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Dependence on key vendors. As described above under Dependence on third party insurance companies and Disruptions or failures in the Companys computer systems; cyber and other information security incidents, the Company is dependent on certain vendors, including third party insurance companies, third party data center providers, third party information technology application providers and third party payment disbursement providers. Any inability to negotiate satisfactory terms with one of these key vendors or any other significant disruption to or termination of a relationship with one of these key vendors could disrupt the Companys operations and impose significant costs on the Company. 
 Potential changes in fuel taxes. From time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced to increase federal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels. The Company cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to the transportation services provided by the Company will be enacted and, if enacted, whether or not the Companys Truck Brokerage Carriers would attempt to pass the increase on to the Company or if the Company will be able to reflect this potential increased cost of capacity, if any, in prices to customers. Any such increase in fuel taxes, without a corresponding increase in price to the customer, could have a material adverse effect on Landstar, including its results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, competition from other transportation service companies including those that provide non-trucking modes of transportation would likely increase if state or federal taxes on fuel were to increase without a corresponding increase in taxes imposed upon other modes of transportation. 
 Catastrophic loss of a Company facility. The Company faces the risk of a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of its facilities located in Jacksonville, Florida, Laredo, Texas and Rockford, Illinois due to hurricanes, flooding, tornados, other weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or otherwise. The Companys corporate headquarters and approximately two-thirds of the Companys employees are located in its Jacksonville, Florida facility. In particular, a significant hurricane or similar catastrophic event that impacts the Jacksonville, Florida metropolitan area could significantly disrupt the Companys operations and impose significant costs on the Company. 
 The Company cannot predict the effect on its business of threatened or real terrorist attacks. It is possible that such threats could result in the catastrophic loss or disruption in use of facilities, roadways, railroads, borders or ports where the Company operates. Also, anti-terrorism security measures could slow freight movements and negatively affect consumer confidence, the overall economy and the transportation industry. Such events could adversely affect Landstar, including its results of operations and financial condition.   
14 


 Although the Company maintains insurance covering its facilities, including business interruption insurance, the Companys insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses that may be incurred in the event of a catastrophic loss of one of the Companys facilities. In addition, such insurance, including business interruption insurance, could in the future become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
 Intellectual property. The Company uses both internally developed and purchased technology in conducting its business. Whether internally developed or purchased, it is possible that the use of these technologies could be claimed to infringe upon or violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. In the event that a claim is made against the Company by a third party for the infringement of intellectual property rights, any settlement or adverse judgment against the Company either in the form of increased costs of licensing or a cease and desist order in using the technology could have an adverse effect on the Companys business and its results of operations. 
 Unclaimed property. The Company is subject to federal and state laws relating to abandoned and unclaimed property. States routinely audit the records of companies to assess compliance with such laws. The Company is currently undergoing a multi-state unclaimed property audit, and in connection with such audit, has entered into a voluntary disclosure agreement (VDA) with the Delaware Department of Finance (DOF). The timing and outcome of this multi-state unclaimed property audit cannot be predicted. The Company may incur significant professional fees in connection with the audit and VDA. If the Company is found to be in noncompliance with applicable unclaimed property laws or the manner in which such laws are interpreted or applied, states may determine that they are entitled to the remittance by the Company of significant amounts of unclaimed or abandoned property and further may seek to impose other significant costs on the Company, including penalties and interest.
