Item 1. Business
 
The Trust and the Funds
 
Teucrium Commodity Trust (“Trust”), a Delaware statutory trust organized on September 11, 2009, is a series trust consisting of five series: Teucrium Corn Fund (“CORN”), Teucrium Sugar Fund (“CANE”), Teucrium Soybean Fund (“SOYB”), Teucrium Wheat Fund (“WEAT”), and Teucrium Agricultural Fund (“TAGS”). All of the series of the Trust are collectively referred to as the “Funds” and singularly as the “Fund.” Each Fund is a commodity pool that is a series of the Trust. The Funds issue common units, called the “Shares,” representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in a Fund.  The Trust and the Funds operate pursuant to the Trust’s Third Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (the “Trust Agreement”).  
 
The Sponsor 
 
Teucrium Trading, LLC is the sponsor of the Trust and each of the series of the Trust. The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company, formed on July 28, 2009. The principal office is located at Three Main Street, Suite 215, Burlington, Vermont 05401. The Sponsor is registered as a commodity pool operator (“CPO”) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and became a member of the National Futures Association (“NFA”) on November 10, 2009. Teucrium Trading, LLC registered as a Commodity Trading Advisor (“CTA”) with the NFA effective September 8, 2017. The Trust and the Funds operate pursuant to the Trust Agreement.
 
Under the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor is solely responsible for the management, and conducts or directs the conduct of the business of the Trust, the Funds, and any other Fund that may from time to time be established and designated by the Sponsor. The Sponsor is required to oversee the purchase and sale of Shares by firms designated as “Authorized Purchasers” and to manage the Funds’ investments, including to evaluate the credit risk of futures commission merchants and swap counter-parties and to review daily positions and margin/collateral requirements. The Sponsor has the power to enter into agreements as may be necessary or appropriate for the offer and sale of the Funds’ Shares and the conduct of the Trust’s activities. Accordingly, the Sponsor is responsible for selecting the Trustee, Administrator, Distributor, the independent registered public accounting firm of the Trust, and any legal counsel employed by the Trust. The Sponsor is also responsible for preparing and filing periodic reports on behalf of the Trust with the SEC and providing any required certification for such reports. No person other than the Sponsor and its principals was involved in the organization of the Trust or the Funds.
 
Teucrium Trading, LLC designs the Funds to offer liquidity, transparency, and capacity in single-commodity investing for a variety of investors, including institutions and individuals, in an exchange-traded product format. The Funds have also been designed to mitigate the impacts of contango and backwardation, situations that can occur in the course of commodity trading which can affect the potential returns to investors. Backwardation is defined as a market condition in which a futures price of a commodity is lower in the distant delivery months than in the near delivery months, while contango, the opposite of backwardation, is defined as a condition in which distant delivery prices for futures exceed spot prices, often due to the costs of storing and insuring the underlying commodity.
 
The Sponsor has a patent on certain business methods and procedures used with respect to the Funds.

Investing Strategy
 
 Overview
 
The Funds are designed and managed so that the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares’ Net Asset Value (“NAV”) reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for specific futures contracts on designated commodities or the closing Net Asset Value per share of the Underlying Funds (as defined below) in the case of TAGS. Each Fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a portfolio of exchange-traded futures contracts (each, a “Futures Contract”) that expire in a specific month and trade on a specific exchange in the designated commodity comprising the Benchmark as defined below, or shares of the Underlying Funds in the case of TAGS. Each Fund has the ability to hold United States Treasury Obligations and/or other high credit quality short-term fixed income securities for deposit with the commodity broker of the Funds as margin and/or on deposit with the custodian or other financial institutions.
 
The investment objective of CORN is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares’ Net Asset Value (“NAV”) reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for corn (“Corn Futures Contracts”) that are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”):
 
CORN Benchmark
 
 
CBOT Corn Futures Contract | Weighting
---------------------------------------+----------
Second to expire | 35% 
Third to expire | 30% 
December following the third to expire | 35% 



The investment objective of SOYB is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares’ Net Asset Value (“NAV”) reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for soybeans (“Soybeans Futures Contracts”) that are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”):
 
SOYB Benchmark
 
 
CBOT Soybeans Futures Contract | Weighting
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------
Second to expire (excluding August & September) | 35% 
Third to expire (excluding August & September) | 30% 
Expiring in the November following the expiration of the third-to-expire contract | 35% 




The investment objective of CANE is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares’ Net Asset Value (“NAV”) reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for No. 11 sugar (“Sugar Futures Contracts”) that are traded on the ICE Futures US (“ICE”):
 
CANE Benchmark
 
 
ICE Sugar Futures Contract | Weighting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------
Second to expire | 35% 
Third to expire | 30% 
Expiring in the March following the expiration of the third-to-expire contract | 35% 




The investment objective of WEAT is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares’ Net Asset Value (“NAV”) reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for wheat (“Wheat Futures Contracts”) that are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”):
 
WEAT Benchmark
 
 
CBOT Wheat Futures Contract | Weighting
---------------------------------------+----------
Second to expire | 35% 
Third to expire | 30% 
December following the third-to-expire | 35% 



The investment objective of the TAGS is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the NAV of its Shares reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average (the “Underlying Fund Average”) of the NAVs per share of four other commodity pools that are series of the Trust and are sponsored by the Sponsor: the Teucrium Corn Fund, the Teucrium Wheat Fund, the Teucrium Soybean Fund and the Teucrium Sugar Fund (collectively, the “Underlying Funds”). The Underlying Fund Average will have a weighting of 25% to each Underlying Fund, and the Fund’s assets will be rebalanced, generally on a daily basis, to maintain the approximate 25% allocation to each Underlying Fund:

 TAGS Benchmark
 
 
Underlying Fund | Weighting
----------------+----------
CORN | 25% 
SOYB | 25% 
CANE | 25% 
WEAT | 25% 



This weighted average of the referenced specific Futures Contracts for each Fund is referred to herein as the “Benchmark,” and the specific Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the Benchmark for that Fund and are referred to herein as the “Benchmark Component Futures Contracts.”
 
Each Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal market conditions in Benchmark Component Futures Contracts (“Futures Contracts”) of the Fund or, in certain circumstances, in other Futures Contracts for its Specified Commodity. In addition, and to a limited extent, a Fund also may invest in exchange-traded options on Futures Contracts for its Specified Commodity. Once position limits or accountability levels on Futures Contracts on a Fund’s Specified Commodity are applicable, each Fund’s intention is to invest first in contracts and instruments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts and forward contracts, swaps and other over-the-counter transactions that are based on the price of its Specified Commodity or Futures Contracts on its Specified Commodity (collectively, “Other Commodity Interests,” and together with Futures Contracts, “Commodity Interests”). By utilizing certain or all of these investments, the Sponsor will endeavor to cause each Fund’s performance to closely track that of its Benchmark.
 
The Sponsor operates the Funds with the intent to never hold a Benchmark Component Futures Contract once it becomes the next-to-expire contract (commonly called the “spot” contract). Accordingly, the positions of each Fund in its Specified Commodity Interests are changed or “rolled” on a regular basis in order to track the changing nature of the Benchmark. Using CORN as an example, five times a year (on the dates on which certain Corn Futures Contracts expire), a particular Corn Futures Contract will no longer be a Benchmark Component Futures Contract, and the Corn Fund’s investments will have to be changed accordingly. Corn Futures Contracts traded on the CBOT expire on a specified day in the following five months: March, May, July, September, and December. Therefore, in terms of the Benchmark, in June of a given year the next-to-expire or “spot month” Corn Futures Contract will expire in July of that year, and the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts will be the contracts expiring in September of that year (the second-to-expire contract), December of that year (the third-to-expire contract), and December of the following year. As another example using CORN, in November of a given year the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts will be the contracts expiring in March, May and December of the following year. The Teucrium Corn Fund is designed to roll or replace its contracts five times per year but will always hold a December Corn Futures Contract as an “anchor” month. The Sponsor will determine if the investments of a Fund will be “rolled” in one day or over a period of several days, in order that any trading does not signal unwanted market movements and to make it more difficult for third parties to profit by trading ahead based on such expected market movements. Such “roll” periods are posted to the website for each Fund well in advance of the “roll” date.
 
The Sponsor employs a “neutral” investment strategy intended to track the changes in the Benchmark of each Fund regardless of whether the Benchmark goes up or goes down. The Fund’s “neutral” investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell the Fund’s Shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in the commodity-specific market in a cost-effective manner. Such investors may include participants in the specific industry and other industries seeking to hedge the risk of losses in their commodity-specific-related transactions, as well as investors seeking exposure to that commodity market. Accordingly, depending on the investment objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated with investing in the commodity-specific market and/or the risks involved in hedging may exist. In addition, an investment in a Fund involves the risks that the changes in the price of the Fund’s Shares will not accurately track the changes in the Benchmark, and that changes in the Benchmark will not closely correlate with changes in the price of the commodity on the spot market. The Sponsor does not intend to operate each Fund in a fashion such that its per share NAV equals, in dollar terms, the spot price of the commodity or the price of any particular commodity-specific Futures Contract.
 
 Calculation of the Benchmark
 
The notional amount of each Benchmark Component Futures Contract included in each Benchmark is intended to reflect the changes in market value of each such Benchmark Component Futures Contract within the Benchmark. The closing level of each Benchmark is calculated on each business day by U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, doing business as U.S. Bank Global Fund Services (the “Administrator”) based on the closing price of the futures contracts for each of the underlying Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and the notional amounts of such Benchmark Component Futures Contracts.

Each Benchmark is rebalanced periodically to ensure that each of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts is weighted in the same proportion as in the investment objective for each Fund. The following tables reflect the December 31, 2018, Benchmark Component Futures Contracts weights for each of the Funds. The contract held is identified by the generally accepted nomenclature of contract month and year, which may differ from the month in which the contract expires:

The price relationship between the near month Futures Contract to expire and the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts will vary and may impact both the total return of each Fund over time and the degree to which such total return tracks the total return of the price indices related to the commodity of each Fund. In cases in which the near month contract’s price is lower than later-expiring contracts’ prices (a situation known as “contango” in the futures markets), then absent the impact of the overall movement in commodity prices the value of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts would tend to decline as they approach expiration. In cases in which the near month contract’s price is higher than later-expiring contracts’ prices (a situation known as “backwardation” in the futures markets), then absent the impact of the overall movement in a Fund’s prices the value of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts would tend to rise as they approach expiration, all other things being equal.

   The total portfolio composition for each Fund is disclosed each business day that the NYSE Arca is open for trading on the Fund’s website. The website for CORN is www.teucriumcornfund.com; for CANE is www.teucriumcanefund.com; for SOYB is www.teucriumsoybfund.com; for WEAT is www.teucriumweatfund.com; for TAGS is www.teucriumtagsfund.com. These sites are accessible at no charge. The website disclosure of portfolio holdings is made daily and includes, as applicable, the name and value of each Futures Contract, other commodity interest and the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in the Fund’s portfolio.  The specific types of other commodity interests held (if any, which may include options on futures contracts and derivative contracts such as swaps) collectively, “Other Commodity Interests,” and together with Futures Contracts, “Commodity Interests” or “Interests” in addition to futures contracts, options on futures contracts and derivative contracts that are tied to various commodities are entered into outside of public exchanges. These “over-the-counter” contracts are entered into between two parties in private contracts, or on a recently formed swap execution facility (“SEF”) for standardized swaps. For example, unlike Futures Contracts, which are guaranteed by a clearing organization, each party to an over-the-counter derivative contract bears the credit risk of the other party (unless such over-the-counter swap is cleared through a derivatives clearing organization (“DCO”)), i.e., the risk that the other party will not be able to perform its obligations under its contract, and characteristics of such Other Commodity Interests.
 
Consistent with achieving a Fund’s investment objective of closely tracking the Benchmark, the Sponsor may for certain reasons cause the Fund to enter into or hold Futures Contracts other than the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and/or Other Commodity Interests. Other Commodity Interests that do not have standardized terms and are not exchange-traded, referred to as “over-the-counter” Corn Interests, can generally be structured as the parties to the Corn Interest contract desire. Therefore, each Fund might enter into multiple and/or over-the-counter Interests intended to replicate the performance of each of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts for the Fund, or a single over-the-counter Interest designed to replicate the performance of the Benchmark as a whole. Assuming that there is no default by a counter-party to an over-the-counter Interest, the performance of the Interest will necessarily correlate with the performance of the Benchmark or the applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract. Each Fund might also enter into or hold Interests other than Benchmark Component Futures Contracts to facilitate effective trading, consistent with the discussion of the Fund’s “roll” strategy. In addition, each Fund might enter into or hold Interests that would be expected to alleviate overall deviation between the Fund’s performance and that of the Benchmark that may result from certain market and trading inefficiencies or other reasons. By utilizing certain or all of the investments described above, the Sponsor will endeavor to cause the Fund’s performance to closely track that of the Benchmark of the Fund.
 
An “exchange for related position” (“EFRP”) can be used by the Fund as a technique to facilitate the exchanging of a futures hedge position against a creation or redemption order, and thus the Fund may use an EFRP transaction in connection with the creation and redemption of shares. The market specialist/market maker that is the ultimate purchaser or seller of shares in connection with the creation or redemption basket, respectively, agrees to sell or purchase a corresponding offsetting futures position which is then settled on the same business day as a cleared futures transaction by the FCMs.  The Fund will become subject to the credit risk of the market specialist/market maker until the EFRP is settled within the business day, which is typically 7 hours or less.  The Fund reports all activity related to EFRP transactions under the procedures and guidelines of the CFTC and the exchanges on which the futures are traded.
 
The Funds earn interest and other income (“interest income”) from cash equivalents that it purchases and on the cash, it holds through the Custodian or other financial institution. The Sponsor anticipates that the interest income will increase the NAV of each Fund. The Funds apply the interest income to the acquisition of additional investments or use it to pay its expenses. If the Fund reinvests the earned interest income, it makes investments that are consistent with its investment objectives as disclosed. Any cash equivalent invested by a Fund will have original maturity dates of three months or less at inception. Any cash equivalents invested by a Fund will be deemed by the Sponsor to be of investment grade quality. At the end of the year, available cash balances in each of the Funds were invested in the Fidelity Institutional Money Market Funds – Government Portfolio, in demand deposits at Rabobank, N.A, and in commercial paper with maturities of ninety days or less.
 
In managing the assets of the Funds, the Sponsor does not use a technical trading system that automatically issues buy and sell orders. Instead, the Sponsor will purchase or sell the specific underlying Commodity Interests with an aggregate market value that approximates the amount of cash received or paid upon the purchase or redemption of Shares.
 
The Sponsor does not anticipate letting the commodity Futures Contracts of any Fund expire, thus taking delivery of the underlying commodity. Instead, the Sponsor will close out existing positions, for instance, in response to ongoing changes in the Benchmark or if it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvest the proceeds in new Commodity Interests. Positions may also be closed out to meet redemption orders, in which case the proceeds from closing the positions will not be reinvested.

 Market Outlook
 
The Corn Market
 
Corn is currently the most widely produced livestock feed grain in the United States. The two largest demands of the United States’ corn crop are used in livestock feed and ethanol production. Corn is also processed into food and industrial products, including starch, sweeteners, corn oil, beverages and industrial alcohol. The United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) publishes weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual updates for U.S. domestic and worldwide corn production and consumption, and for other grains such as soybeans and wheat which can be used in some cases as a substitute for corn. These reports are available on the USDA’s website, www.usda.gov, at no charge. The January 2019 reports were not published due to a lapse in federal funding. The outlook provided below is from the December 11, 2018 USDA report.
 
The United States is the world’s leading producer and exporter of corn. For the Crop Year 2018-19, the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) estimates that the U.S. will produce approximately 34% of all the corn globally, of which about 17% will be exported. For 2018-2019, based on the December 2018 USDA reports, global consumption of 1,131 Million Metric Tons (MMT) is expected to be slightly higher than global production of 1,100 MMT. If the global supply of corn exceeds global demand, this may have an adverse impact on the price of corn. Besides the United States, other principal world corn exporters include Argentina, Brazil and the former Soviet Union nations known as the FSU-12 which includes the Ukraine. Major importer nations include Mexico, Japan, the European Union (EU), South Korea, Egypt and parts of Southeast Asia. China’s production at 256 MMT is approximately 8% less than its domestic usage.

According to the USDA, global corn consumption has increased just over 479% from crop year 1960/1961 to 2018/2019 as demonstrated by the graph below and is projected to continue to grow in upcoming years. Consumption growth is the result of a combination of many factors including: 1) global population growth, which, according to the U.S. Census Department, is estimated to increase by approximately 78.3 million people in the 2018-19 time-frame and reach 9.5 billion by 2050; 2) a growing global middle class which is increasing the demand for protein and meat-based products globally and most significantly in developing countries; and 3) increased use of bio-fuels, including ethanol in the United States. Based on USDA estimates as of December 11, 2018, for each person added to the population, there needs to be an additional 5.9 bushels of corn, 1.7 bushels of soybeans and 3.6 bushels of wheat produced.
      While global consumption of corn has increased over the 1960/1961-2018/2019 period, so has production, driven by increases in acres planted and yield per acre. However, according to the USDA and United Nations, future growth in planted acres and yield may be inhibited by lower-productive land, and lack of infrastructure and transportation. In addition, agricultural crops such as corn are highly weather-dependent for yield and therefore susceptible to changing weather patterns. In addition, given the current production/consumption patterns, nearly 100% of all corn produced globally is consumed which leaves minimal excess inventory if production issues arise.

The price per bushel of corn in the United States is primarily a function of both U.S. and global production, as well as U.S. and global demand. The graph below shows the USDA published price per bushel by month for the period January 2007 to November 2018.

On December 11, 2018, the USDA released its monthly World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) for the Crop Year 2018-19. The exhibit below provides a summary of historical and current information for United States corn production.
 


Standard Corn Futures Contracts trade on the CBOT in units of 5,000 bushels, although 1,000 bushels “mini-corn” Corn Futures Contracts also trade. Three grades of corn are deliverable under CBOT Corn Futures Contracts: Number 1 yellow, which may be delivered at 1.5 cents over the contract price; Number 2 yellow, which may be delivered at the contract price; and Number 3 yellow, which may be delivered at 1.5 cents under the contract price for all contract months prior to March 2019 or may be delivered between 2 and 4 cents per bushel under the contract price for all contract months commencing with March 2019 and beyond. There are five months each year in which CBOT Corn Futures Contracts expire: March, May, July, September and December.

   If the futures market is in a state of backwardation (i.e., when the price of corn in the future is expected to be less than the current price), the Fund will buy later-to-expire contracts for a lower price than the sooner-to-expire contracts that it sells. Hypothetically, and assuming no changes to either prevailing corn prices or the price relationship between immediate delivery, soon-to-expire contracts and later-to-expire contracts, the value of a contract will rise as it approaches expiration. Over time, if backwardation remained constant, the differences would continue to increase. If the futures market is in contango, the Fund will buy later-to-expire contracts for a higher price than the sooner-to-expire contracts that it sells. Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing corn prices or the price relationship between the spot price, soon-to-expire contracts and later-to-expire contracts, the value of a contract will fall as it approaches expiration. Over time, if contango remained constant, the difference would continue to increase. Historically, the corn futures markets have experienced periods of both contango and backwardation. Frequently, whether contango or backwardation exists is a function, among other factors, of the seasonality of the corn market and the corn harvest cycle. All other things being equal, a situation involving prolonged periods of contango may adversely impact the returns of the Fund; conversely a situation involving prolonged periods of backwardation may positively impact the returns of the Fund.
The Soybean Market
 
Global soybean production is concentrated in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina and China. The United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) has estimated that, for the Crop Year 2018-19, the United States will produce approximately 125 MMT of soybeans or approximately 34% of estimated world production, with Brazil production at 122 MMT. Argentina is projected to produce about 56 MMT. For 2018-19, based on the December 2018 USDA report, global consumption of 352 MMT is estimated slightly lower than global production of 369 MMT. If the global supply of soybeans exceeds global demand, this may have an adverse impact on the price of soybeans. The USDA publishes weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual updates for U.S. domestic and worldwide soybean production and consumption. These reports are available on the USDA’s website, www.usda.gov, at no charge. The January 2019 reports were not published due to a lapse in federal funding. The outlook provided below is from the December 11, 2018 USDA report.
 
The soybean processing industry converts soybeans into soybean meal, soybean hulls, and soybean oil. Soybean meal and soybean hulls are processed into soy flour or soy protein, which are used, along with other commodities, by livestock producers and the fish farming industry as feed. Soybean oil is sold in multiple grades and is used by the food, petroleum and chemical industries. The food industry uses soybean oil in cooking and salad dressings, baking and frying fats, and butter substitutes, among other uses. In addition, the soybean industry continues to introduce soy-based products as substitutes to various petroleum-based products including lubricants, plastics, ink, crayons and candles. Soybean oil is also converted to biodiesel for use as fuel.
 
Standard Soybean Futures Contracts trade on the CBOT in units of 5,000 bushels, although 1,000 bushel “mini-sized” Soybean Futures Contracts also trade. Three grades of soybean are deliverable under CBOT Soybean Futures Contracts: Number 1 yellow, which may be delivered at 6 cents per bushel over the contract price; Number 2 yellow, which may be delivered at the contract price; and Number 3 yellow, which may be delivered at 6 cents per bushel under the contract price. There are seven months each year in which CBOT Soybean Futures Contracts expire: January, March, May, July, August, September and November.
 
If the futures market is in a state of backwardation (i.e., when the price of soybeans in the future is expected to be less than the current price), the Fund will buy later-to-expire contracts for a lower price than the sooner-to-expire contracts that it sells. Hypothetically, and assuming no changes to either prevailing soybean prices or the price relationship between immediate delivery, soon-to-expire contracts and later-to-expire contracts, the value of a contract will rise as it approaches expiration. If the futures market is in contango, the Fund will buy later-to-expire contracts for a higher price than the sooner-to-expire contracts that it sells. Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing soybean prices or the price relationship between the spot price, soon-to-expire contracts and later-to-expire contracts, the value of a contract will fall as it approaches expiration. Historically, the soybeans futures markets have experienced periods of both contango and backwardation. Frequently, whether contango or backwardation exists is a function, among other factors, of the seasonality of the soybean market and the soybean harvest cycle. All other things being equal, a situation involving prolonged periods of contango may adversely impact the returns of the Fund; conversely a situation involving prolonged periods of backwardation may positively impact the returns of the Fund.
 
The price per bushel of soybeans in the United States is primarily a function of both U.S. and global production, as well as U.S. and global demand. The graph below shows the USDA published price per bushel by month for the period January 2007 to November 2018.

On December 11, 2018, the USDA released its monthly World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) for the Crop Year 2018-19. The exhibit below provides a summary of historical and current information for United States soybean production.
The Sugar Market
 
Sugarcane accounts for about 80% of the world’s sugar production, while sugar beets account for the remainder of the world’s sugar production.  Sugar manufacturers use sugar beets and sugarcane as the raw material from which refined sugar (sucrose) for industrial and consumer use is produced.  Sugar is produced in various forms, including granulated, powdered, liquid, brown, and molasses. The food industry (in particular, producers of baked goods, beverages, cereal, confections, and dairy products) uses sugar and sugarcane molasses to make sugar-containing food products. Sugar beet pulp and molasses products are used as animal feed ingredients.  Ethanol is an important by-product of sugarcane processing.  Additionally, the material that is left over after sugarcane is processed is used to manufacture paper, cardboard, and “environmentally friendly” eating utensils.
 
The Sugar No. 11 Futures Contract is the world benchmark contract for raw sugar trading.  This contract prices the physical delivery of raw cane sugar, delivered to the receiver’s vessel at a specified port within the country of origin of the sugar.  Sugar No. 11 Futures Contracts trade on ICE Futures US and the NYMEX in units of 112,000 pounds. 
 
The United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) publishes two major reports annually on U.S. domestic and worldwide sugar production and consumption. These are usually released in November and May. In addition, the USDA publishes periodic, but not as comprehensive, reports on sugar monthly. These reports are available on the USDA’s website, www.usda.gov, at no charge. The USDA’s November 2018 report forecasts that India, with estimated record production of 35.9 million metric tons, surpassed Brazil as the leading producer of sugarcane worldwide for the first time in 16 years. India's production, which outpaces the other principal global producers, namely Brazil, Thailand and China, equates to approximately 19% of the world’s supply. The principal producers of sugar beets, as forecast by the USDA for 2019, include the European Union, the United States, and Russia.
 
 World estimated raw sugar production is 186 million metric tons, which is forecast down 9 million tons from the prior year primarily due to the drop in Brazil caused by unfavorable weather and more sugarcane being diverted towards ethanol production. The USDA’s report released in November 2018 estimates that for the 2018/2019 Crop Year, record global consumption of 176 million metric tons will still be below production and ending stocks are projected to rise to 53 million metric tons. Similar to the 2017/18 Crop Year, the current period may see the global supply for sugar exceed demand. In the past, this situation has, generally, resulted in a price decrease. However, if the global demand of sugar exceeds global supply, prices will generally increase.

The USDA, in its November 2018 report highlights, in the graph immediately below, projecting record stocks and consumption despite lower production compared to the 2017/2018 Crop Year. The second graph shows India, the leading producer of sugarcane, which surpasses Brazil for the first time in 16 years.
 
  

If the futures market is in a state of backwardation (i.e., when the price of sugar in the future is expected to be less than the current price), the Fund will buy later-to-expire contracts for a lower price than the sooner-to-expire contracts that it sells. Hypothetically, and assuming no changes to either prevailing sugar prices or the price relationship between immediate delivery, soon-to-expire contracts and later-to-expire contracts, the value of a contract will rise as it approaches expiration. If the futures market is in contango, the Fund will buy later-to-expire contracts for a higher price than the sooner-to-expire contracts that it sells. Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing sugar prices or the price relationship between the spot price, soon-to-expire contracts and later-to-expire contracts, the value of a contract will fall as it approaches expiration. Historically, the sugar futures markets have experienced periods of both contango and backwardation. Frequently, whether contango or backwardation exists is a function, among other factors, of the seasonality of the sugar market and the sugar harvest cycle. All other things being equal, a situation involving prolonged periods of contango may adversely impact the returns of the Funds; conversely a situation involving prolonged periods of backwardation may positively impact the returns of the Funds.

The Wheat Market
 
Wheat is used to produce flour, the key ingredient for breads, pasta, crackers and many other food products, as well as several industrial products such as starches and adhesives. Wheat by-products are used in livestock feeds. Wheat is the principal food grain produced in the United States, and the United States’ output of wheat is typically exceeded only by that of China, the European Union, the former Soviet nations, known as the FSU-12, including the Ukraine, and India. The United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) estimates that for 2018-19, the principal global producers of wheat will be the EU, the former Soviet nations known as the FSU-12, China, India, the United States, Australia and Canada. The U.S. generates approximately 7% of the global production, with approximately 53% of that being exported. For 2018-19, based on the December 2018 USDA report, global consumption of 745 MMT is estimated to be slightly higher than production of 733 MMT. If the global supply of wheat exceeds global demand, this may have an adverse impact on the price of wheat. The USDA publishes weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual updates for U.S. domestic and worldwide wheat production and consumption. These reports are available on the USDA’s website, www.usda.gov, at no charge. The January 2019 reports were not published due to a lapse in federal funding. The outlook provided below is from the December 11, 2018 USDA report.
 
There are several types of wheat grown in the U.S., which are classified in terms of color, hardness, and growing season. CBOT Wheat Futures Contracts call for delivery of #2 soft red winter wheat, which is generally grown in the eastern third of the United States, but other types and grades of wheat may also be delivered (Grade #1 soft red winter wheat, Hard Red Winter, Dark Northern Spring and Northern Spring wheat may be delivered at 3 cents premium per bushel over the contract price and #2 soft red winter wheat, Hard Red Winter, Dark Northern Spring and Northern Spring wheat may be delivered at the contract price.) Winter wheat is planted in the fall and is harvested in the late spring or early summer of the following year, while spring wheat is planted in the spring and harvested in late summer or fall of the same year. Standard Wheat Futures Contracts trade on the CBOT in units of 5,000 bushels, although 1,000 bushel “mini-wheat” Wheat Futures Contracts also trade. There are five months each year in which CBOT Wheat Futures Contracts expire: March, May, July, September and December.
 
If the futures market is in a state of backwardation (i.e., when the price of wheat in the future is expected to be less than the current price), the Fund will buy later-to-expire contracts for a lower price than the sooner-to-expire contracts that it sells. Hypothetically, and assuming no changes to either prevailing wheat prices or the price relationship between immediate delivery, soon-to-expire contracts and later-to-expire contracts, the value of a contract will rise as it approaches expiration. If the futures market is in contango, the Fund will buy later-to-expire contracts for a higher price than the sooner-to-expire contracts that it sells. Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing wheat prices or the price relationship between the spot price, soon-to-expire contracts and later-to-expire contracts, the value of a contract will fall as it approaches expiration. Historically, the wheat futures markets have experienced periods of both contango and backwardation. Frequently, whether contango or backwardation exists is a function, among other factors, of the seasonality of the wheat market and the wheat harvest cycle. All other things being equal, a situation involving prolonged periods of contango may adversely impact the returns of the Fund; conversely a situation involving prolonged periods of backwardation may positively impact the returns of the Fund.
 
The price per bushel of wheat in the United States is primarily a function of both U.S. and global production, as well as U.S. and global demand. The graph below shows the USDA published price per bushel by month for the period January 2007 to November 2018.

 Competitive Environment
 
Investors may choose among several options when considering an investment in agricultural commodities.  For instance, an investor may choose to invest directly in commodity futures, although such an investment generally requires significant capital.  Additionally, there are a variety of commodity index funds which include baskets of commodity interests; these funds invest in a range of commodity interests, although some are weighted toward, or invest solely in, agricultural commodities.  Finally, there are exchange-traded notes which are credit instruments, some of which may invest or mirror investments in agricultural commodities.

The Sponsor’s Operations
 
The Sponsor established the Trust and caused the Trust to establish the first series, the Corn Fund, which commenced offering its Shares to the public on June 9, 2010. Three additional series, namely the Sugar Fund, the Soybean Fund and the Wheat Fund, commenced offering of shares in September 2011 and the Teucrium Agricultural Fund commenced operation on March 28, 2012. Aside from establishing these series, operating those series that have commenced offering their shares and obtaining capital from a small number of outside investors in order to engage in these activities, the Sponsor did not engage in any business activity. 
 
The Trust and the Funds do not have any employees or officers.  Any persons acting as agents of the Trust or the Funds do so as employees or officers of the Sponsor. 
 
Under the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor is solely responsible for the management, and conducts or directs the conduct of the business of the Trust, the Funds, and any other Fund that may from time to time be established and designated by the Sponsor. The Sponsor is required to oversee the purchase and sale of Shares by firms designated as “Authorized Purchasers” and to manage the Funds’ investments, including to evaluate the credit risk of futures commission merchants and swap counter-parties and to review daily positions and margin/collateral requirements. The Sponsor has the power to enter into agreements as may be necessary or appropriate for the offer and sale of the Funds’ Shares and the conduct of the Trust’s activities. Accordingly, the Sponsor is responsible for selecting the Trustee, Administrator, Distributor, the independent registered public accounting firm of the Trust, and any legal counsel employed by the Trust. The Sponsor is also responsible for preparing and filing periodic reports on behalf of the Trust with the SEC and providing any required certification for such reports. No person other than the Sponsor and its principals was involved in the organization of the Trust or the Funds.
 
The Sponsor maintains websites on behalf of each of the Funds. The total portfolio composition of each Fund is disclosed on the Fund’s website each business day that the NYSE Arca is open for trading. The website disclosure of portfolio holdings is made daily and includes, as applicable, the name and value of each Commodity Futures Contract held and those that are pending, and the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in the Fund’s portfolio. Each Fund’s website also includes the NAV, the 4 p.m. Bid/Ask Midpoint as reported by the NYSE Arca, the last trade price as reported by the NYSE Arca, the shares outstanding, the shares available for issuance, and the shares created or redeemed on that day. The prospectus, Monthly Statement of Account, Quarterly Performance of the Midpoint versus the NAV, and the Roll Dates, as well as Form 10-Qs, Form 10-Ks, and other SEC filings for that Fund, are also posted on the website. Each Fund’s website is publicly accessible at no charge. The website for CORN is www.teucriumcornfund.com; for CANE is www.teucriumcanefund.com; for SOYB is www.teucriumsoybfund.com; for WEAT is www.teucriumweatfund.com; and for TAGS is www.teucriumtagsfund.com. The website address for the Sponsor is www.teucrium.com.
 
The Sponsor receives a fee as compensation for services performed under the Trust Agreement, except in the case of TAGS where there is no such fee. The Sponsor’s fees accrue daily and are paid monthly at an annual rate of 1.00% of the average daily net assets of each Fund, with the exception of TAGS. In addition, each Fund is also generally responsible for other ongoing fees, costs and expenses of its operations, including brokerage fees and SEC registration fees, and legal, printing, accounting, custodial, administration and transfer agency costs, although the Sponsor has borne or will bear the costs and expenses related to the initial offer and sale of Shares. The Funds will generally bear the costs and expenses associated with filing a new registration statement for each Fund every three years, unless the Sponsor waives all or part of such costs and expenses. The Sponsor may choose to waive, for a period of time and at its discretion, the collection of the Sponsor Fee or certain other fees for any of the Funds. Certain aggregate expenses common to all Funds within the Trust are allocated by the Sponsor to the respective funds based on activity drivers deemed most appropriate by the Sponsor for such expenses, including but not limited to relative assets under management and creation order activity. These aggregate common expenses include, but are not limited to, legal, auditing, accounting and financial reporting, tax-preparation, regulatory compliance, trading activities, and insurance costs, as well as fees paid to the Distributor, which are included in the related line item in the combined statements of operations.
 
A portion of these aggregate common expenses are related to the Sponsor or related parties of principals of the Sponsor; these are necessary services to the Trust and the Funds, which are primarily the cost of performing accounting and financial reporting, regulatory compliance, and trading activities that are directly attributable to the Trust and the Funds. For the period ended December 31, such expenses, which are primarily included as distribution and marketing fees, totaled $2,674,984 in 2018, $2,196,388 in 2017, and $1,825,552 in 2016; of these amounts, $556,063 in 2018, $453,736 in 2017, and $457,658 in 2016 were waived by the Sponsor.
 
All asset-based fees and expenses for the Funds are calculated on the prior day’s net assets.
 
The Sponsor has an information technology plan (the “IT Plan”) in place which is part of the internal controls of the Trust and the Funds. The IT Plan  takes reasonable care to look beyond the security and controls developed and implemented for the Trust and the Funds directly to the platforms and controls in place for the key service providers. Such review of the IT plans of key service providers is part of the Sponsor’s disaster recovery and business continuity planning. The Sponsor provides regular training to all employees of the Sponsor regarding cybersecurity topics, in addition to real-time dissemination of information regarding cybersecurity matters as needed. The IT plan is reviewed and updated as needed, but at a minimum on an annual basis.
 
Ownership or “membership” interests in the Sponsor are owned by persons referred to as “members.” The Sponsor currently has three voting or “Class A” members – Mr. Sal Gilbertie, Mr. Dale Riker and Mr. Carl N. Miller III – and a small number of non-voting or “Class B” members who have provided working capital to the Sponsor. Messrs. Gilbertie and Riker each currently own 45.7%, and Mr. Miller owns 8.52%, of the Sponsor’s Class A membership interests.

 DTC
 
DTC has advised us as follows:  It is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.  DTC holds securities for DTC Participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of DTC Participants.
Transfer of Shares
 
For all Funds, the Shares are only transferable through the book-entry system of DTC.  Shareholders who are not DTC Participants may transfer their Shares through DTC by instructing the DTC Participant holding their Shares (or by instructing the Indirect Participant or other entity through which their Shares are held) to transfer the Shares.  Transfers are made in accordance with standard securities industry practice.
 
Transfers of interests in Shares with DTC are made in accordance with the usual rules and operating procedures of DTC and the nature of the transfer.  DTC has established procedures to facilitate transfers among the participants and/or account holders of DTC.  Because DTC can only act on behalf of DTC Participants, who in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person or entity having an interest in a global certificate to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in DTC, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be affected by the lack of a certificate or other definitive document representing such interest.
 
DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Shareholder (including, without limitation, the presentation of a global certificate for exchange) only at the direction of one or more DTC Participants in whose account with DTC interests in global certificates are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the global certificate as to which such DTC Participant or Participants has or have given such direction.
 
Creation and Redemption of Shares
 
The Funds create and redeem Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets.  The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to the Funds or the distribution by the Funds of the amount of cash equal to the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.
 
Authorized Purchasers are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets.  Authorized Purchasers must be (1) either registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions, and (2) DTC Participants.  To become an Authorized Purchaser, a person must enter into an Authorized Purchaser Agreement with the Sponsor.  The Authorized Purchaser Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the cash required for such creations and redemptions.  The Authorized Purchaser Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by the Sponsor, without the consent of any Shareholder or Authorized Purchaser.  Authorized Purchasers pay a transaction fee to the Sponsor for each order they place to create one or more baskets and a fee per basket when they redeem baskets.
 
Authorized Purchasers who make deposits with a Fund in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the Trust or the Sponsor, and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to the Trust or the Sponsor to effect any sale or resale of Shares.
 
Certain Authorized Purchasers are expected to be capable of investing directly in the Specified Commodities or the Commodity Interest markets.  Some Authorized Purchasers or their affiliates may from time to time buy or sell the Specified Commodity or Commodity Interests and may profit in these instances.  
 
Each Authorized Purchaser will be required to be registered as a broker-dealer under the 1934 Act and a member in good standing with FINRA or be exempt from being or otherwise not required to be registered as a broker-dealer or a member of FINRA, and will be qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires.  Certain Authorized Purchasers may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations.  Each Authorized Purchaser has its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime.
 
Under the Authorized Purchaser Agreement, the Sponsor has agreed to indemnify the Authorized Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the 1933 Act, and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

 Minimum Number of Shares
 
There are a minimum number of baskets and associated shares specified for each Fund in the Fund’s respective prospectus as amended from time to time. Once the minimum number of baskets is reached, there can be no more redemptions until there has been a creation basket. As of December 31, 2018, these minimum levels are as follows: 
 
CORN: 50,000 shares representing 2 baskets (3,500,004 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018; 3,600,004 shares outstanding as of March 12, 2019)
 SOYB: 50,000 shares representing 2 baskets (1,725,004 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018; 1,475,004 shares outstanding as of March 12, 2019)
 CANE: 50,000 shares representing 2 baskets (1,525,004 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018; 1,400,004 shares outstanding as of March 12, 2019)
 WEAT: 50,000 shares representing 2 baskets (9,275,004 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018; 10,225,004 shares outstanding as of March 12, 2019)
 TAGS: 50,000 shares representing 4 baskets (75,002 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018; 75,002 shares outstanding as of March 12, 2019)
 
If a Fund has not more than the minimum number of shares outstanding, this means that there can be no redemptions of shares until there is a creation of shares or unless the Sponsor has reason to believe that the placer of the redemption order does in fact possess all the outstanding Shares in the Fund and can deliver them. When there can be no redemption of shares, the price of the Fund, as represented by the bid and the ask, compared to the NAV may diverge more than would be the case if redemptions could occur. 
 
The following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the Trust Agreement and the form of Authorized Purchaser Agreement for more detail, each of which has been incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the registration statement for each of the Funds.

 Calculating the Net Asset Value
 
The NAV of each Fund is calculated by:
 
   ●
 Taking the current market value of its total assets, and


   ●
 Subtracting any liabilities.


The Administrator calculates the NAV of each Fund once each trading day.  It calculates NAV as of the earlier of the close of the New York Stock Exchange or 4:00 p.m., New York time.  The NAV for a particular trading day will be released after 4:15 p.m., New York time.
 
In determining the value of the Futures Contracts for each Fund, the Administrator uses the closing price on the exchange on which the commodity is traded, commonly referred to as the settlement price.  The time of settlement for each exchange is determined by that exchange and may change from time to time.  The current settlement time for each exchange can be found at the respective website for the CBOT or ICE, as the case may be, as follows: 
 
1) for the CBOT (CORN, SOYB and WEAT) http://www.cmegroup.com/trading_hours/commodities-hours.html;
 
2) for ICE (CANE) http://www.theice.com/productguide/Search.shtml?tradingHours=.
 
The Administrator determines the value of all other investments for each Fund as of the earlier of the close of the New York Stock Exchange or 4:00 p.m., New York time, in accordance with the current Services Agreement between the Administrator and the Trust. 
 
The value of over-the-counter Commodity Interests will be determined based on the value of the commodity or Futures Contract underlying such Commodity Interest, except that a fair value may be determined if the Sponsor believes that a Fund is subject to significant credit risk relating to the counterparty to such Commodity Interest. For purposes of financial statements and reports, the Sponsor will recalculate the NAV of a specific Fund where necessary to reflect the “fair value” of a Futures Contract when the Futures Contract of such Fund closes at its price fluctuation limit for the day. Treasury Securities held by the Fund are valued by the Administrator using values received from recognized third-party vendors (such as Reuters) and dealer quotes.  The NAV includes any unrealized profit or loss on open Commodity Interests and any other credit or debit accruing to each Fund but unpaid or not received by the Fund.
 
In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to the Funds for use by investors and market professionals, ICE Data Indices, LLC calculates and disseminates throughout the trading day an updated indicative fund value for each Fund. The indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day’s closing NAV per share of the Fund as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the value of the Fund’s Commodity Interests during the trading day.  Changes in the value of Treasury Securities and cash equivalents are not included in the calculation of indicative value.  For this and other reasons, the indicative fund value disseminated during NYSE Arca trading hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the NAV for each Fund.  The NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day. 
 
The indicative fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca trading hours of 9:30 a.m., New York time, to 4:00 p.m., New York time.  The CBOT and the ICE are generally open for trading only during specified hours which vary by exchange and may be adjusted by the exchange. However, the futures markets on these exchanges do not currently operate twenty-four hours per day. In addition, there may be some trading hours which may be limited to electronic trading only. This means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which the Fund’s Shares are traded on the NYSE Arca, when, for example, real-time CBOT trading prices for Corn Futures Contracts traded on such Exchange are not available.  As a result, during those gaps there will be no update to the indicative fund values. The most current trading hours for each exchange may be found on the website of that exchange as listed above.
 
ICE Data Indices, LLC disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines.  In addition, the indicative fund value is published on the NYSE Arca’s website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.
 
Dissemination of the indicative fund values provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of Shares of the Funds on the NYSE Arca.  Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of each Fund and its indicative fund value.  If the market price of the Shares of a Fund diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals may have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades.  For example, if the Fund appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy Fund Shares on the NYSE Arca, aggregate them into Redemption Baskets, and receive the NAV of such Shares by redeeming them to the Trust, provided that there is not a minimum number of shares outstanding for the Fund.  Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of the Fund and the indicative fund value.

 Creation Procedures
 
On any business day, an Authorized Purchaser may place an order with the transfer agent to create one or more baskets for a Fund.  For purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders, a “business day” means any day other than a day when any of the NYSE Arca, CBOT, ICE, or the New York Stock Exchange is closed for regular trading.  Purchase orders must be placed by noon New York time or the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, whichever is earlier for CANE and TAGS. Purchase orders must be placed by 1:15pm New York time or the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, whichever is earlier for CORN, SOYB and WEAT.  The day on which the transfer agent and Distributor receive a valid purchase order is referred to as the purchase order date.
 
By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to deposit Treasury Securities, cash, commodity futures or shares of the Underlying Funds or a combination thereof with the Trust, as described below.  Prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Purchaser must also have wired to the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order.  Authorized Purchasers may not withdraw a purchase order without the prior consent of the Sponsor in its discretion.

 Determination of Required Deposits
 
The total deposit required to create each basket (Creation Basket Deposit) is the amount of Treasury Securities, cash and/or commodity futures that is in the same proportion to the total assets of the applicable Fund (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the purchase order date as the number of Shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of Shares outstanding on the purchase order date.  The Sponsor determines, directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the Custodian and the Administrator, the requirements for Treasury Securities, cash and/or commodity futures, including the remaining maturities of the Treasury Securities and portions of Treasury Securities, that may be included in deposits to create baskets.  If Treasury Securities are to be included in a Creation Basket Deposit for orders placed on a given business day, the Administrator will publish an estimate of the Creation Basket Deposit requirements at the beginning of such day.
 Delivery of Required Deposits
 
An Authorized Purchaser who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to the account of that Fund with the Custodian the required amount of securities, commodity futures and/or cash by the end of the next business day following the purchase order date or by the end of such later business day, not to exceed three business days after the purchase order date, as agreed to between the Authorized Purchaser and the Custodian when the purchase order is placed (the “Purchase Settlement Date”).  Upon receipt of the deposit amount, the Custodian will direct DTC to credit the number of baskets ordered for the specific Fund to the Authorized Purchaser’s DTC account on the Purchase Settlement Date.
 
Because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by noon or 1:15 pm, New York time, depending on the Fund, but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the date the purchase order is received, Authorized Purchasers will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket.  The Fund’s NAV and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined.
 
 Rejection of Purchase Orders
 
The Sponsor acting by itself or through the Distributor or transfer agent may reject a purchase order or a Creation Basket Deposit if:
 
   ●
 it determines that, due to position limits or otherwise, investment alternatives that will enable the Fund to meet its investment objective are not available or practicable at that time;


   ●
 it determines that the purchase order or the Creation Basket Deposit is not in proper form;


   ●
 it believes that acceptance of the purchase order or the Creation Basket Deposit would have adverse tax consequences to the Fund or its Shareholders;


   ●
 the acceptance or receipt of the Creation Basket Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel to the Sponsor, be unlawful;


   ●
 circumstances outside the control of the Sponsor, Distributor or transfer agent make it, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process creations of baskets;


   ●
 there is a possibility that any or all of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts of the Fund on the CBOT from which the NAV of the Fund is calculated will be priced at a daily price limit restriction; or


   ●
 if, in the sole discretion of the Sponsor, the execution of such an order would not be in the best interest of the Fund or its Shareholders.


None of the Sponsor, Distributor or transfer agent will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit.
 
In addition, the Sponsor may reject a previously placed purchase order at any time prior to the order cut-off time, if in the sole discretion of the Sponsor the execution of such an order would not be in the best interest of a Fund or its Shareholders.

    Redemption Procedures
 
The procedures by which an Authorized Purchaser can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets.  On any business day, an Authorized Purchaser may place an order with the Distributor to redeem one or more baskets.  Redemption orders must be placed by noon or 1:15 pm, New York time, depending on the Fund, or the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, whichever is earlier.  A redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the transfer agent and Distributor.  The redemption procedures allow Authorized Purchasers to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual Shareholder to redeem any Shares in an amount less than a Redemption Basket, or to redeem baskets other than through an Authorized Purchaser.  By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through DTC’s book-entry system to a Fund by the end of the next business day following the effective date of the redemption order for all funds other than TAGS or by the end of the third business day for TAGS, or by the end of such later business day, not to exceed three business days after the effective date of the redemption order, as agreed to between the Authorized Purchaser, transfer agent and the Distributor when the redemption order is placed (the “Redemption Settlement Date”).  Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Purchaser must also have wired to the Sponsor’s account at the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order.  An Authorized Purchaser may not withdraw a redemption order without the prior consent of the Sponsor in its discretion. 
 Determination of Redemption Distribution
 
The redemption distribution from a Fund will consist of a transfer to the redeeming Authorized Purchaser of an amount of securities, commodity futures and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of the Fund (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of Shares to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of Shares outstanding on the date the order is received.   The Sponsor, directly or in consultation with the Custodian and Administrator, determines the requirements for securities, commodity futures and/or cash, including the remaining maturities of the Treasury Securities and proportions of Treasury Securities and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets.  If Treasury Securities are to be included in a redemption distribution for orders placed on a given business day, the Administrator will publish an estimate of the redemption distribution composition as of the beginning of such day.
 Delivery of Redemption Distribution
 
The redemption distribution due from a Fund will be delivered to the Authorized Purchaser on the Redemption Settlement Date if the Fund’s DTC account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed.  If the Fund’s DTC account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by the end of such date, the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received.  Any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day after the Redemption Settlement Date to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if the Sponsor receives the fee applicable to the extension of the Redemption Settlement Date which the Sponsor may, from time to time, determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to the Fund’s DTC account on such next business day.  Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled.  Pursuant to information from the Sponsor, the Custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to the Fund’s DTC account by noon New York time on the Redemption Settlement Date if the Authorized Purchaser has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through DTC’s book entry-system on such terms as the Sponsor may from time to time determine.
 Suspension or Rejection of Redemption Orders
 
The Sponsor may, in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca, CBOT or ICE is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on the NYSE Arca or any of the applicable exchanges, is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of Treasury Securities is not reasonably practicable, (3) for such other period as the Sponsor determines to be necessary for the protection of the Shareholders, (4) if there is a possibility that any or all of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts of the applicable Fund on the exchange from which the NAV of the Fund is calculated will be priced at a daily price limit restriction, or (5) if, in the sole discretion of the Sponsor, the execution of such an order would not be in the best interest of the Fund or its Shareholders.  
 
For example, the Sponsor may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of a Fund’s assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption.  If the Sponsor has difficulty liquidating a Fund’s positions, e.g., because of a market disruption event in the futures markets or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an over-the-counter contract, it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified.  None of the Sponsor, the Distributor, or the transfer agent will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement.
 
Redemption orders must be made in whole baskets. The Sponsor will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Authorized Purchaser Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful.  The Sponsor may also reject a redemption order if the number of Shares being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding Shares below the minimum levels established or less, unless the Sponsor has reason to believe that the placer of the redemption order does in fact possess all the outstanding Shares and can deliver them. The minimum number of shares for each Fund is presented above in the section titled Minimum Number of Shares.
 
 Creation and Redemption Transaction Fees
 
To compensate the Sponsor for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets, an Authorized Purchaser is required to pay a transaction fee to the Sponsor. The fees for all Funds as of December 31, 2018 are a flat $250 per creation or redemption order.
 
The transaction fees may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by the Sponsor.
 
 Tax Responsibility
 
Authorized Purchasers are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Purchaser, and agree to indemnify the Sponsor and the Fund if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.

 Liability and Indemnification
 
Under the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor, the Trustee and their respective Affiliates (collectively, “Covered Persons”) shall have no liability to the Trust, the Fund, or to any Shareholder for any loss suffered by the Trust or the Fund which arises out of any action or inaction of such Covered Person if such Covered Person, in good faith, determined that such course of conduct was in the best interest of the Trust or the Fund and such course of conduct did not constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Covered Person.  Subject to the foregoing, neither the Sponsor nor any other Covered Person shall be personally liable for the return or repayment of all or any portion of the capital or profits of any Shareholder or assignee thereof, it being expressly agreed that any such return of capital or profits made pursuant to the Trust Agreement shall be made solely from the assets of the applicable Teucrium Fund without any rights of contribution from the Sponsor or any other Covered Person. A Covered Person shall not be liable for the conduct or willful misconduct of any administrator or other delegatee selected by the Sponsor with reasonable care, provided, however, that the Trustee and its Affiliates shall not, under any circumstances be liable for the conduct or willful misconduct of any administrator or other delegatee or any other person selected by the Sponsor to provide services to the Trust.
 
To the extent that, at law (common or statutory) or in equity, the Sponsor has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating to the Trust, the Funds, the shareholders of the Funds, or to any other person, the Sponsor, acting under the Trust Agreement, shall not be liable to the Trust, the Funds, the shareholders of the Funds or to any other person for its good faith reliance on the provisions of the Trust Agreement.  The provisions of the Trust Agreement, to the extent they restrict or eliminate the duties and liabilities of the Sponsor otherwise existing at law or in equity, replace such other duties and liabilities of the Sponsor.
 
The Trust Agreement also provides that the Sponsor shall be indemnified by the Trust (or by a series separately to the extent the matter in question relates to a single series or disproportionately affects a specific series in relation to other series) against any losses, judgments, liabilities, expenses and amounts paid in settlement of any claims sustained by it in connection with its activities for the Trust, provided that (i) the Sponsor was acting on behalf of or performing services for the Trust and has determined, in good faith, that such course of conduct was in the best interests of the Trust and such liability or loss was not the result of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or a breach of the Trust Agreement on the part of the Sponsor and (ii) any such indemnification will only be recoverable from the assets of the applicable series.  The Sponsor’s rights to indemnification permitted under the Trust Agreement shall not be affected by the dissolution or other cessation to exist of the Sponsor, or the withdrawal, adjudication of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Sponsor, or the filing of a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy under Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code by or against the Sponsor.
 
Notwithstanding the above, the Sponsor shall not be indemnified for any losses, liabilities or expenses arising from or out of an alleged violation of U.S. federal or state securities laws unless (i) there has been a successful adjudication on the merits of each count involving alleged securities law violations as to the particular indemnitee and the court approves the indemnification of such expenses (including, without limitation, litigation costs), (ii) such claims have been dismissed with prejudice on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction as to the particular indemnitee and the court approves the indemnification of such expenses (including, without limitation, litigation costs), or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement of the claims against a particular indemnitee and finds that indemnification of the settlement and related costs should be made.
 
The payment of any indemnification shall be allocated, as appropriate, among the Trust’s series.  The Trust and its series shall not incur the cost of that portion of any insurance which insures any party against any liability, the indemnification of which is prohibited under the Trust Agreement.
 
Expenses incurred in defending a threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding against the Sponsor shall be paid by the Trust in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, if (i) the legal action relates to the performance of duties or services by the Sponsor on behalf of the Trust; (ii) the legal action is initiated by a party other than the Trust; and (iii) the Sponsor undertakes to repay the advanced funds with interest to the Trust in cases in which it is not entitled to indemnification. 
 
The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor and the Trust shall indemnify the Trustee and its successors, assigns, legal representatives, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and servants (the “Trustee Indemnified Parties”) against any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, taxes, claims, actions, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements which may be imposed on a Trustee Indemnified Party relating to or arising out of the formation, operation or termination of the Trust, the execution, delivery and performance of any other agreements to which the Trust is a party, or the action or inaction of the Trustee under the Trust Agreement or any other agreement, except for expenses resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of a Trustee Indemnified Party.  Further, certain officers of the Sponsor are insured against liability for certain errors or omissions which an officer may incur or that may arise out of his or her capacity as such.
 
In the event the Trust is made a party to any claim, dispute, demand or litigation or otherwise incurs any liability or expense as a result of or in connection with any Shareholder’s (or assignee’s) obligations or liabilities unrelated to the Trust business, such Shareholder (or assignees cumulatively) is required under the Trust Agreement to indemnify the Trust for all such liability and expense incurred, including attorneys’ and accountants’ fees.
 
 Withdrawal of the Sponsor
 
The Sponsor may withdraw voluntarily as the Sponsor of the Trust only upon ninety (90) days’ prior written notice to the holders of the Trust’s outstanding shares and the Trustee.  If the withdrawing Sponsor is the last remaining Sponsor, shareholders holding a majority (over 50%) of the outstanding shares of the Funds voting together as a single class (not including shares acquired by the Sponsor through its initial capital contribution) may vote to elect a successor Sponsor.  The successor Sponsor will continue the business of the Trust.  Shareholders have no right to remove the Sponsor.
 
In the event of withdrawal, the Sponsor is entitled to a redemption of the shares it acquired through its initial capital contribution to any of the series of the Trust at their NAV per share.  If the Sponsor withdraws and a successor Sponsor is named, the withdrawing Sponsor shall pay all expenses as a result of its withdrawal.

 Meetings
 
Meetings of the Shareholders of the Trust’s Series may be called by the Sponsor and will be called by it upon the written request of Shareholders holding at least 25% of the Shares of the Trust or a Fund, as applicable (not including Shares acquired by the Sponsor through its initial capital contribution), to vote on any matter with respect to which Shareholders have a right to vote under the Trust Agreement.  The Sponsor shall deposit in the United States mail or electronically transmit written notice to all Shareholders of a Fund of the meeting and the purpose of the meeting, which shall be held on a date not less than 30 nor more than 60 days after the date of mailing of such notice, at a reasonable time and place.  When the meeting is being requested by Shareholders, the notice of the meeting shall be mailed or transmitted within 45 days after receipt of the written request from Shareholders.  Any notice of meeting shall be accompanied by a description of the action to be taken at the meeting.  Shareholders may vote in person or by proxy at any such meeting.  Any action required or permitted to be taken by Shareholders by vote may be taken without a meeting by written consent setting forth the actions so taken.  Such written consents shall be treated for all purposes as votes at a meeting.  If the vote or consent of any Shareholder to any action of the Trust, a Fund, the Funds or any Shareholder, as contemplated by the Trust Agreement, is solicited by the Sponsor, the solicitation shall be effected by notice to each Shareholder given in the manner provided in accordance with the Trust Agreement.
 Voting Rights
 
Shareholders have very limited voting rights.  Specifically, the Trust Agreement provides that shareholders of the Funds holding shares representing at least a majority (over 50%) of the outstanding shares of the Funds voting together as a single class (excluding shares acquired by the Sponsor in connection with its initial capital contribution to any Trust series) may vote to (i) continue the Trust by electing a successor Sponsor as described above, and (ii) approve amendments to the Trust Agreement that impair the right to surrender Redemption Baskets for redemption.  (Trustee consent to any amendment to the Trust Agreement is required if the Trustee reasonably believes that such amendment adversely affects any of its rights, duties or liabilities.)  In addition, shareholders of the Funds holding shares representing seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding shares of the Funds, voting together as a single class (excluding shares acquired by the Sponsor in connection with its initial capital contribution to any Trust series) may vote to dissolve the Trust upon not less than ninety (90) days’ notice to the Sponsor.  Shareholders have no voting rights with respect to the Trust or a Fund except as expressly provided in the Trust Agreement.  For TAGS, fund Shareholders have no voting rights with respect to shares of the Underlying Funds held by that Fund.
 Limited Liability of Shareholders
 
Shareholders shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the general corporation law of Delaware, and no Shareholder shall be liable for claims against, or debts of the Trust or the Fund in excess of his share of a Fund’s assets.  The Trust or a Fund shall not make a claim against a Shareholder with respect to amounts distributed to such Shareholder or amounts received by such Shareholder upon redemption unless, under Delaware law, such Shareholder is liable to repay such amount.
 
The Trust or a Fund shall indemnify to the full extent permitted by law and the Trust Agreement each Shareholder (excluding the Sponsor to the extent of its ownership of any Shares acquired through its initial capital contribution) against any claims of liability asserted against such Shareholder solely because of its ownership of Shares (other than for taxes on income from Shares for which such Shareholder is liable). 
 
Every written note, bond, contract, instrument, certificate or undertaking made or issued by the Sponsor on behalf of the Trust or a Fund shall give notice to the effect that the same was executed or made by or on behalf of the Trust or a Fund and that the obligations of such instrument are not binding upon the Shareholders individually but are binding only upon the assets and property of a Fund and no recourse may be had with respect to the personal property of a Shareholder for satisfaction of any obligation or claim.
 
The Sponsor Has Conflicts of Interest
 
There are present and potential future conflicts of interest in the Trust’s structure and operation you should consider before you purchase Shares.  The Sponsor may use this notice of conflicts as a defense against any claim or other proceeding made.
 
The Sponsor’s principals, officers and employees, do not devote their time exclusively to the Funds.  Under the organizational documents of the Sponsor, Mr. Sal Gilbertie in his respective capacities as President, Chief Investment Officer of the Sponsor and Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of the Sponsor, is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to manage the Sponsor, devote such amount of time to the Sponsor as would be consistent with his role in similarly placed commodity pool operators, and remain active in managing the Sponsor until he is no longer managing members of the Sponsor or the Sponsor dissolves.  In addition, the Sponsor expects that operating the Teucrium Funds will generally constitute the principal and full-time business activity of its principals, officers and employees.  Notwithstanding these obligations and expectations, the Sponsor’s principals may be directors, officers or employees of other entities, and may manage assets of other entities, including the other Teucrium Funds, through the Sponsor or otherwise.  In particular, the principals could have a conflict between his responsibilities to the Fund on the one hand and to those other entities on the other.  The Sponsor believes that it currently has sufficient personnel, time, and working capital to discharge its responsibilities to the Fund in a fair manner and that these persons’ conflicts should not impair his ability to provide services to the Fund.  However, it is not possible to quantify the proportion of his time that the Sponsor’s personnel will devote to the Fund and its management.
 
The Sponsor and its principals, officers and employees may trade futures and related contracts for their own accounts.  Shareholders will not be permitted to inspect the trading records of such persons or any written policies of the Sponsor related to such trading.  A conflict of interest may exist if their trades are in the same markets and at approximately the same times as the trades for the Fund.  A potential conflict also may occur when the Sponsor’s principals trade their accounts more aggressively or take positions in their accounts which are opposite, or ahead of, the positions taken by the Fund.
 
The Sponsor has sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of the Fund, and this may allow it to act in a way that furthers its own interests rather than your best interests, including the authority of the Sponsor to allocate expenses to and between the Funds.  Shareholders have very limited voting rights, which will limit their ability to influence matters such as amendment of the Trust Agreement, change in the Fund’s basic investment policies, or dissolution of the Fund or the Trust.
 
The Sponsor serves as the Sponsor to the Teucrium Funds, and may in the future serve as the Sponsor or investment adviser to commodity pools other than the Teucrium Funds.  The Sponsor may have a conflict to the extent that its trading decisions for the Fund may be influenced by the effect they would have on the other pools it manages.  In addition, the Sponsor may be required to indemnify the officers and directors of the other pools, if the need for indemnification arises.  This potential indemnification will cause the Sponsor’s assets to decrease.  If the Sponsor’s other sources of income are not sufficient to compensate for the indemnification, it could cease operations, which could in turn result in Fund losses and/or termination of the Fund.

 If the Sponsor acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or arrangement that may be an opportunity for the Fund, it shall have no duty to offer such opportunity to the Fund.  The Sponsor will not be liable to the Fund or the Shareholders for breach of any fiduciary or other duty if Sponsor pursues such opportunity or directs it to another person or does not communicate such opportunity to the Fund.  Neither the Fund nor any Shareholder has any rights or obligations by virtue of the Trust Agreement, the trust relationship created thereby, or this prospectus in such business ventures or the income or profits derived from such business ventures.  The pursuit of such business ventures, even if competitive with the activities of the Fund, will not be deemed wrongful or improper.
 Resolution of Conflicts Procedures
 
The Trust Agreement provides that whenever a conflict of interest exists between the Sponsor or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Trust, any shareholder of a Trust series, or any other person, on the other hand, the Sponsor shall resolve such conflict of interest, take such action or provide such terms, considering in each case the relative interest of each party (including its own interest) to such conflict, agreement, transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interests, any customary or accepted industry practices, and any applicable generally accepted accounting practices or principles.  In the absence of bad faith by the Sponsor, the resolution, action or terms so made, taken or provided by the Sponsor shall not constitute a breach of the Trust Agreement or any other agreement contemplated therein or of any duty or obligation of the Sponsor at law or in equity or otherwise.
 
The Sponsor or any affiliate thereof may engage in or possess an interest in other profit-seeking or business ventures of any nature or description, independently or with others, whether or not such ventures are competitive with the Trust and the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, shall not apply to the Sponsor.  If the Sponsor acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for the Trust, it shall have no duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to the Trust, and the Sponsor shall not be liable to the Trust or to the Shareholders for breach of any fiduciary or other duty by reason of the fact that the Sponsor pursues or acquires for, or directors such opportunity to, another person or does not communicate such opportunity or information to the Trust.  Neither the Trust nor any Shareholder shall have any rights or obligations by virtue of the Trust Agreement or the trust relationship created thereby in or to such independent ventures or the income or profits or losses derived therefrom, and the pursuit of such ventures, even if competitive with the activities of the Trust, shall not be deemed wrongful or improper.  Except to the extent expressly provided in the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor may engage or be interested in any financial or other transaction with the Trust, the Shareholders or any affiliate of the Trust or the Shareholders. 
 
Regulatory Considerations
 
The regulation of futures markets, futures contracts, and futures exchanges has historically been comprehensive. The CFTC and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits, increased margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading on an exchange or trading facility.
 
In addition, considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional publicly distributed investment pools such as the Funds.  Furthermore, various national governments have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in certain commodity markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general.  The effect of any future regulatory change on the Funds is impossible to predict, but could be substantial and adverse.
 
Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the NFA has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association.  At the present time, the NFA is the only self-regulatory organization for commodity interest professionals, other than futures exchanges.  The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of CPOs and FCMs and their respective associated persons.  The Sponsor and the Fund’s clearing broker are members of the NFA.  As such, they will be subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition and consumer protection. The NFA also arbitrates disputes between members and their customers and conducts registration and fitness screening of applicants for membership and audits of its existing members.  Neither the Trust nor the Funds are required to become a member of the NFA. The regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action. As noted above, considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United States. There is a possibility of future regulatory changes within the United States altering, perhaps to a material extent, the nature of an investment in the Funds, or the ability of a Fund to continue to implement its investment strategy.
 
The CFTC possesses exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the activities of commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors with respect to “commodity interests,” such as futures and swaps and options, and has adopted regulations with respect to the activities of those persons and/or entities.  Under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), a registered commodity pool operator, such as the Sponsor, is required to make annual filings with the CFTC and the NFA describing its organization, capital structure, management and controlling persons.  In addition, the CEA authorizes the CFTC to require and review books and records of, and documents prepared by, registered commodity pool operators.  Pursuant to this authority, the CFTC requires commodity pool operators to keep accurate, current and orderly records for each pool that they operate.  The CFTC may suspend the registration of a commodity pool operator (1) if the CFTC finds that the operator’s trading practices tend to disrupt orderly market conditions, (2) if any controlling person of the operator is subject to an order of the CFTC denying such person trading privileges on any exchange, and (3) in certain other circumstances.  Suspension, restriction or termination of the Sponsor’s registration as a commodity pool operator would prevent it, until that registration were to be reinstated, from managing the Funds, and might result in the termination of a Fund if a successor sponsor is not elected pursuant to the Trust Agreement.  Neither the Trust nor the Funds are required to be registered with the CFTC in any capacity.
 
The Funds’ investors are afforded prescribed rights for reparations under the CEA.  Investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations of the CEA.  The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEA, which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the CEA against a floor broker or an FCM, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, CPO, and their respective associated persons.
 
The regulations of the CFTC and the NFA prohibit any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA, that registration with the CFTC, or membership in the NFA, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA has approved or endorsed that person or that person’s trading program or objectives.  The registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such approval or endorsement.  Likewise, no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement.

Trading venues in the United States are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the CEA depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market (i.e. a futures exchange) or a swap execution facility. Clearing organizations are also subject to the CEA and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder as administered by the CFTC. The CFTC’s function is to implement the CEA’s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets. In addition, the various exchanges and clearing organizations themselves as self-regulatory organizations exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms.
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted in response to the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009 and it significantly altered the regulatory regime to which the securities and commodities markets are subject. To date, the CFTC has issued proposed or final versions of almost all of the rules it is required to promulgate under the Dodd-Frank Act, and it continues to issue proposed versions of additional rules that it has authority to promulgate. Provisions of the new law include the requirement that position limits be established on a wide range of commodity interests,  including agricultural, energy, and metal-based commodity futures contracts, options on such futures contracts and uncleared swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures contracts and options (“Reference Contracts”); new registration and recordkeeping requirements for swap market participants; capital and margin requirements for “swap dealers” and “major swap participants,” as determined by the new law and applicable regulations; reporting of all swap transactions to swap data repositories; and the mandatory use of clearinghouse mechanisms for sufficiently standardized swap transactions that were historically entered into in the over-the-counter market, but are now designated as subject to the clearing requirement; and margin requirements for over-the-counter swaps that are not subject to the clearing requirements. 
 
The Dodd-Frank Act was intended to reduce systemic risks that may have contributed to the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Since the first draft of what became the Dodd-Frank Act, opponents have criticized the broad scope of the legislation and, in particular, the regulations implemented by federal agencies as a result. Since 2010, and most notably in 2015 and 2016, Republicans have proposed comprehensive legislation both in the House and the Senate of the US Congress. These bills are intended to pare back some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 that critics view as overly broad, unnecessary to the stability of the U.S. financial system, and inhibiting the growth of the U.S. economy. Further, during the campaign and after taking office, President Donald J. Trump has promised and issued several executive orders intended to relieve the financial burden created by the Dodd-Frank Act, although these executive orders only set forth several general principles to be followed by the federal agencies and do not mandate the wholesale repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act. The scope of the effect that passage of new financial reform legislation could have on U.S. securities, derivatives and commodities markets is not clear at this time because each federal regulatory agency would have to promulgate new regulations to implement such legislation. Nevertheless, regulatory reform may have a significant impact on U.S.-regulated entities.
 
Management believes that as of December 31, 2018, it had fulfilled in a timely manner all Dodd-Frank or other regulatory requirements to which it is subject.
 
Position Limits, Aggregation Limits, Price Fluctuation Limits
 
On December 16, 2016, the CFTC issued a final rule to amend part 150 of the CFTC’s regulations with respect to the policy for aggregation under the CFTC’s position limits regime for futures and option contracts on nine agricultural commodities (“the Aggregation Requirements”). This final rule addressed the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate all their positions, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in Reference Contracts of the 9 agricultural commodities held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such positions exist on US futures exchanges, non-US futures exchanges, or in over-the-counter swaps.  An affiliate of a market participant is defined as two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding.  The Aggregation Requirements became effective on February 14, 2017. On August 10, 2017, the CFTC issued a No-Action Relief Letter No. 17-37 to clarify several provisions under Regulation 150.4, regarding position aggregation filing requirements of market participants. The Sponsor does not anticipate that this order will have an impact on the ability of a Fund to meet its respective investment objectives.
 
In addition, on December 30, 2016, the CFTC reproposed regulations that would establish revised specific limits on speculative positions in futures contracts, option contracts and swaps on 25 agricultural, energy and metals commodities (the “Proposed Position Limit Rules”).
 
The Proposed Position Limit Rules were a reproposal and the CFTC has requested comments from the public. It remains to be seen whether the Proposed Position Limit Rules will become effective as the CFTC has proposed, as comments could result in modifications to the proposed limits or implementation could be delayed for other reasons. In general, the Proposed Position Limit Rules do not appear to have a substantial or adverse effect on the Funds. However, if the total net assets of a Fund were to increase significantly from current levels, the Position Limit Rules as proposed could negatively impact the ability of a Fund to meet its respective investment objectives through limits that may inhibit the Sponsor’s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of the Fund. However, it is not expected that any Fund will reach asset levels that would cause these position limits to be reached in the near future.

   In addition, the Proposed Position Limit Rules state that the CFTC will review, and may amend, the Position Limit Rules at a minimum every two years and more often as deemed necessary. Such future amendments may affect a Fund or Funds, and it may, at that time, be substantial and adverse.  By way of example, future amendments, in combination with the Position Limit Rules, may negatively impact the ability of the Fund to meet its respective investment objectives through limits that may inhibit the Sponsor’s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of the Fund, if the total net assets of a Fund grow significantly from current levels.
 
The futures exchanges, e.g. the CME, may under the Proposed Position Limit Rules impose position limits which are lower than those imposed by the CFTC. Such a limit by an exchange on which a Fund trades futures contracts may negatively and adversely impact the ability of the Fund to meet its respective investment objectives through limits that may inhibit the Sponsor’s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of the Fund. No such lower limits by an exchange are currently in place.
 
The aggregate position limits currently in place under the current position limits and the Aggregation Requirements are as follows for each of the commodities traded by the Funds:
 
 
Commodity Future | Spot Month Position Limit | All Month Aggregate Position Limit
-----------------+---------------------------+-----------------------------------
corn | 600 contracts | 33,000 contracts 
soybeans | 600 contracts | 15,000 contracts 
sugar | 5,000 contracts | Only Accountability Limits 
wheat | 600 contracts | 12,000 contracts 



The aggregate speculative position limits currently as proposed in the Proposed Position Limit Rules are as follows for each of the commodities traded by the Funds:
 
 
Commodity Future | Spot Month Position Limit | All Month Aggregate Position Limit
-----------------+---------------------------+-----------------------------------
corn | 600 contracts | 62,400 contracts 
soybeans | 600 contracts | 31,900 contracts 
sugar | 23,300 contracts | 38,400 contracts 
wheat | 600 contracts | 32,800 contracts 



Accountability levels differ from position limits in that they do not represent a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which a futures exchange may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor’s positions.  If a Fund were to exceed an applicable accountability level for investments in futures contracts, the exchange will monitor the Fund’s exposure and may ask for further information on its activities, including the total size of all positions, investment and trading strategy, and the extent of liquidity resources of the Fund.  If deemed necessary by the exchange, the Fund could be ordered to reduce its aggregate net position back to the accountability level. 
 
In addition to position limits and accountability levels, the exchanges set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts.  The daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of futures contracts may vary either up or down from the previous day’s settlement price.  Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit.
 
As of May 1, 2014, the CME replaced the fixed price fluctuation limits with variable price limits for corn, soybeans and wheat. The change, which is now effective and is described in the CME Group Special Executive Report S-7038 and can be accessed at http://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/lookups/advisories/ser/SER-7038.html.

Margin for OTC Uncleared Swaps
 
During 2015 and 2016, the CFTC and the US bank prudential regulators completed their rulemakings under the Dodd-Frank Act on margin for uncleared over-the-counter swaps (and option agreements that qualify as swaps). Margin requirements went into effect for the largest swap entities in September 2016 and went into effect for small financial entities in March 2017. Under these regulations, swap dealers (such as sell-side counterparties to swaps), major swap participants, and financial end users (such as buy-side counterparties to swaps who are not physical traders) are required in most instances, to post and collect initial and variation margin, depending on the regulatory classification of their counterparty. European and Asian regulators are also implementing similar regulations, which were scheduled to become effective on the same dates as the US-promulgated rules. As a result of these requirements, additional capital will be required to be committed to the margin accounts to support transactions involving uncleared over-the-counter swaps and, consequently, these transactions may become more expensive. While the Funds currently do not generally engage in uncleared over the counter swaps, to the extent they do so in the future, the additional margin required to be posted could adversely impact the profitability (if any) to the Funds from entering into these transactions.
Books and Records
 
The Trust keeps its books of record and account at its office located at Three Main Street, Suite 215, Burlington Vermont 05401, or at the offices of U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, doing business as U.S. Bank Global Fund Services ("Fund Services"), the Administrator, located at 615 East Michigan Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202, or such office, including of an administrative agent, as it may subsequently designate upon notice.  The books of account of the Fund are open to inspection by any Shareholder (or any duly constituted designee of a Shareholder) at all times during the usual business hours of the Fund upon reasonable advance notice to the extent such access is required under CFTC rules and regulations.  In addition, the Trust keeps a copy of the Trust Agreement on file in its office which will be available for inspection by any Shareholder at all times during its usual business hours upon reasonable advance notice.
