Corporate History and Overview
 
SmartMetric, Inc. (“SmartMetric” or the “Company”) was incorporated pursuant to the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2002. SmartMetric is a development stage company engaged in the technology industry. SmartMetric’s main products are a fingerprint sensor debit card as well as a card with a finger sensor and fully functional fingerprint reader embedded inside the card. The SmartMetric biometric cards have a rechargeable battery allowing for portable biometric identification and card activation. This card is referred to as a biometric card or the SmartMetric Biometric Card.
The Market for Biometric Credit Cards
 
According to a to a press release issued by Goode Intelligence, an independent market research company, regarding their October 2018 report on the biometrics payment sector, nearly 579 million biometric credit/debit cards will be in use over the next five (5) years. Goode Intelligence believes* there is a significant market opportunity for biometric payment cards. and forecasts that by 2023 there will be almost 579 million biometric payment cards in use around the world.
 
“Contactless card payments are even outperforming mobile in many regions. Many consumers prefer to use a contactless payment card over a mobile payment equivalent and according to Goode Intelligence research, many users would like to use cards in contactless mode for higher value transactions. Biometric payment cards not only offer improved security by removing the PIN but also allow frictionless payments for higher value transactions,” stated Good Intelligence.
 
SmartMetric engaged an outside independent research company to survey a statistically relevant sample of Visa credit card holders in the United States. One of the questions asked showed that nearly 67% of these credit card holders would be willing to pay $69.95 for a biometric secured credit card.

The SmartMetric Biometric Technology and Products
 
SmartMetric’s founder, Chaya Hendrick is the originator and inventor of various miniature biometric activated cards, including the SmartMetric biometric fingerprint activated payments card with an embedded fully functional fingerprint reader inside. the card. The card is the size and thickness of a standard credit card. The SmartMetric biometric payments card provides for high level security for credit and debit cards by adding biometric authentication and activation to Europay, MasterCard and Visa (“EMV”) chip cards in use around the world. The SmartMetric biometric payments card has been manufactured to be totally interoperable with existing EMV chip card readers, ATMs as well as banking payments infrastructure. Using the advanced electronic miniaturization by SmartMetric to make its biometric credit/debit cards the Company has also created a multi-functional biometric building access control and logical network access card.
 
Since July 1, 2018, SmartMetric has commenced efforts towards creating a biometric health insurance card with memory for storing a person’s medical files, including medical images. This allows a person to securely take with them their private medical files inside the card when traveling away from home. For the first time, a person’s complete medical files can be stored in a credit card-sized card and the information is only able to be accessed by the card holder’s own fingerprint. The company is in discussion with significant health membership organizations concerning the offering of the SmartMetric Biometric Medical Records card to their respective members.
 
SmartMetric has developed its rechargeable battery powered fingerprint reader that is of a scale that fits “inside” a standard credit or debit card. The cardholder has stored inside the card his or her fingerprint. To activate the card the person swipes the fingerprint sensor, the sensor is connected to an internal microprocessor that manages the fingerprint sensor fingerprint image capture and comparison matching with the pre-stored fingerprint of the cardholder held in the internal electronic memory of the card. The card has a surface mounted EMV chip as found on EMV banking chip cards that is activated or turned on only after a card holder’s fingerprint has been scanned and verified using the SmartMetric miniature “in-card” biometric scanner.
 
There are over seven (7) billion EMV chip cards used by banks around the world for credit cards, ATM cards and debit cards according to EMVco. SmartMetric sees this existing user base as a natural market for its advanced biometric activated card technology for the credit and debit card market. SmartMetric has established a network of card manufacturers and technology distributors to market its in-card biometric products to card issuing banks and in the case of the SmartMetric biometric security card, to businesses.
 
SmartMetric has completed development of its biometric card and is now actively marketing its card to major card issuing banks throughout the world in partnership with established card distributors and dealers.

SmartMetric has also developed a multi-function logical and physical access security card this size and thickness of a standard credit card. Utilizing the small size breakthroughs by the Company in its biometric payments card development, SmartMetric has successfully developed a biometric security card that is the size and thickness of a standard credit card that can easily fit inside a person’s wallet.
 
As with the biometric payments card, the SmartMetric security card has an internal rechargeable battery that is used to power the card’s internal processor used in the biometric fingerprint scan. All functions and operations of the card are subject to a valid fingerprint scan and match of the card user.
 
On February 1, 2019, SmartMetric entered into a manufacturing and license agreement with Servired, SA (“Servired”). Servired operates the major payments network in Spain for credit and debit card transactions. Subsequently, the Servired agreement has been transferred and assumed in total by RedSys, SA. (“RedSys”) as part of a corporate reorganization. RedSys is now the corporate entity that owns the ADVANTIS (discussed later) credit card and debit card chip and operating software system. Regarding integration of Advantis in Redsys, Redsys acquired from Servired, through company succession, the independent economic marketing unit of the Advantis System and the Pricenet, SIS and SAS family programs.
 
The ADVANTIS EMV Chip and operating system is currently being used by banks around the world on their debit and credit cards. 1.4 Billion cards with the ADVANTIS chip and software operating system have been issued by their member banks worldwide.
 
SmartMetric is now in the process of manufacturing its biometric credit/debit card with the ADVANTIS payments card chip and operating system. This will allow over 500 Banks worldwide, who are already using the ADVANTIS chip and chip card operating system, to seamlessly issue this new SmartMetric – ADVANTIS biometric credit and debit card.
 
Additional technological advances have now been made on both the Company’s biometric credit/debit card and its multifunction cyber security, building access to the biometric card.


In Card Fingerprint Matching and Verification
 
The SmartMetric Biometric card incorporates a rechargeable, lithium polymer battery. This battery is rechargeable, very thin and has been designed by SmartMetric to fit inside the SmartMetric fingerprint credit card sized card. This battery is manufactured by a third party unaffiliated with the Company to SmartMetric’s specifications. This battery is embedded inside the card.
 
Other components needed for manufacture of the SmartMetric Biometric Card include, but are not limited to, sensors, microchips, memory chips and processor chips. The ultra-thin circuit board developed by SmartMetric has, in total, nearly 200 active and passive components. The sources and availability of these materials are numerous, readily available and should not affect the ability of SmartMetric to meet future demand. The supply of memory processors and passive components may be interrupted at any time based on global supply/demand issues. We have not experienced component supply issues to date and the Company, as a matter of policy, has alternative component sources to mitigate and protect against supply chain issues.
 
The biometric card has been designed to offer the option of a built-in radio frequency transmitter for contactless access and identity verification. The RFID contactless chip transmission is turned on using the card users fingerprint verification.
 
The thinness form factor of many of the components, has also resulted in the Company having to develop its own process for high volume electronic assembly. The Company has also successfully overcome the challenge of developing a process of encapsulating the electronics in plastic to create the credit card sized biometric fingerprint activated card that also has an internal rechargeable battery.
 
Standard credit card manufacturing utilizes machines that require high pressure and high temperature in fusing top and bottom sheets of plastic together thereby encasing any electronics inside the card. Given the complexity of the card’s electronics and vulnerability to an assembly process involving high heat and high pressure, damage to the electronic circuitry was a major challenge for the Company to overcome. Research and development activities of the Company allowed the Company to achieve this ability through a trade secret process that protects the silicon and internal battery that is mounted directly onto the card’s internal electronics circuit board.

Biometrics
 
Biometric technologies identify users by electronically capturing a specific biological or behavioral characteristic of that individual, such as a fingerprint or voice or facial feature, and creating a unique digital identifier from that characteristic. Because this process relies on largely unalterable human characteristics, positive identification can be achieved independent of any information possessed by the individual seeking authorization.
 
The process of identity authentication typically requires that a person present for comparison with one or more of the following factors:
 

● | Something known such as a password, PIN or mother’s maiden name;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Something carried such as a token, card, or key; or
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | something physical such as fingerprint, voice pattern, signature motion, facial shape or other biological or behavioral characteristic.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Comparison of biological and behavioral characteristics has historically been the most reliable and accurate of the three factors but has also been the most difficult and costly to implement into a single product that can automatically verify the identity of a user accessing a computer network or the Internet. However, recent advances in biometric collection technologies (both biometric hardware products and their associated processing software) have increased the speed and accuracy and reduced the cost of implementing biometrics in commercial environments. Management believes that individuals, website operators, government organizations, and businesses will increasingly use this method of identity authentication.
 
Biometrics refers to the automatic identification of a person based on his/her physiological or behavioral characteristics. This method of identification is preferred over traditional methods involving passwords and personal identification numbers (“PINs”) for two reasons: (i) the person to be identified is required to be physically present at the point of identification to be identification; and (ii) identification based on biometric techniques obviates the need to remember a password or carry a token. By replacing PINs, biometric techniques can potentially prevent unauthorized access to or fraudulent use of cellular phones, Biometric cards, desktop PCs, workstations and computer networks. It can be used during transactions conducted via telephone and Internet (e-commerce and e-banking). In automobiles, biometrics could replace keys-less entry devices. The SmartMetric fingerprint activated credit card that has the fingerprint encased inside the credit card has been developed to replace the less secure PIN’s for credit and debit cards.
 
PINs and passwords may be forgotten, may be hacked and token-based methods of identification, e.g., passports and driver’s licenses, may be forged, stolen or lost. Various types of biometric systems are being used for real-time identification, with the most popular based on facial recognition and fingerprint matching. Other biometric systems utilize iris and retinal scanning, speech, facial thermograms and hand geometry. Of the biometric options available to work with a credit or debit card, fingerprint scanning is the only biometric methodology that has been successfully reduced in size to fit inside such cards.
 
A biometric system is essentially a pattern recognition system, which makes a personal identification by determining the authenticity of a specific physiological or behavioral characteristic possessed by the user. An important issue in designing a practical system is to determine how an individual is identified.
 
There are two different ways to resolve a person’s identity; verification and identification. Verification (Am I whom I claim I am?) involves confirming or denying a person’s claimed identity. In identification, one has to establish a person’s identity (Who am I?).
 
As stated above, the SmartMetric fingerprint biometric card has been designed as a credit-card sized card embedded with an integrated circuit, contact chip and biometric fingerprint sensor. The SmartMetric card has been designed to provide not only memory capacity, but also computational capability along with secure non-refutable identification of the user. We believe that the self-containment of SmartMetric’s card makes it substantially resistant to attack, as it will not need to depend upon vulnerable external resources. Because of this characteristic, we expect that the SmartMetric biometric card may be used in different applications, which require strong security protection and authentication. 
 
The physical structure of a card is specified by the International Standards Organization (“ISO”). Generally, this structure is made up of three elements: (i) the plastic card, which is the most basic one and has the dimensions of 85.60mm x 53.98 x 0.80mm; (ii) an electronic circuit board inlay; and (iii) a contact chip that are embedded in the card.
 
The SmartMetric card has been designed to conform to ISO standards. The electronic circuit inlay is a part of, and not distinct from, the biometric card.
 
The communication line between the card and ATMs and other standard Smart Card reading devices is bi-directional serial transmission, which conforms to ISO standards. Card commands and input data are sent to the chip that responds with status words and output data upon the receipt of these commands and data. Information is sent in half duplex mode (transmission of data is in one direction at a time). This protocol, together with the restriction of the bit rate, is designed to prevent data attack on the card. Other data protection systems are utilized inside the card including advanced encryption.

In general, the size, the thickness and bend requirements for the biometric card were designed to protect the card from being spoiled physically.
