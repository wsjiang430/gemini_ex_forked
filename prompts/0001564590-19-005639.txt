--------+---------

 Nektar Therapeutics is a research-based biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing innovative medicines in areas of high unmet medical need. Our research and development pipeline of new investigational drugs includes potential therapies for cancer, autoimmune disease and chronic pain. We leverage our proprietary and proven chemistry platform to discover and design new drug candidates. These drug candidates utilize our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action. We continue to make significant investments in building and advancing our pipeline of proprietary drug candidates as we believe that this is the best strategy to build long-term stockholder value. We refer to our drug candidates where we retain at least U.S. commercial rights as “proprietary programs” and our other drug candidate programs that we have licensed U.S. and potentially other commercial rights to collaboration partners as “collaboration partner programs.” 
 Our Proprietary Programs 
 Immuno-oncology (I-O)
 In the area of I-O, we are developing medicines that target biological pathways, which stimulate and sustain the body’s immune response in order to fight cancer. We are developing medicines designed to directly or indirectly modulate the activity of key immune cells, such as cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, to increase their numbers and improve their function to recognize and attack cancer cells. 
 NKTR-214 (also known as bempegaldesleukin), our lead I-O candidate, is a biologic with biased signaling through one of the Interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor subunits (CD 122) that can stimulate proliferation and growth of tumor-killing immune cells in the tumor micro-environment and increase expression of PD-1 on these immune cells. We are executing a comprehensive clinical development program for NKTR-214, including through a broad clinical collaboration with the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), clinical collaborations with other third parties with pharmacological agents that have potential complementary mechanisms to NKTR-214, as well as pursuing our own independent clinical studies.  
 On February 13, 2018, we entered into a Strategic Collaboration Agreement (BMS Collaboration Agreement) with BMS, pursuant to which we and BMS are jointly developing NKTR-214, including combinations with BMS’s Opdivo® (nivolumab), Opdivo® plus Yervoy® (ipilimumab), and certain other agents. The key economic components of the collaboration transaction included BMS making a non-refundable up-front payment of $1 billion to Nektar and an $850 million equity investment in our common stock at a premium over the 20-day VWAP for each share of common stock, BMS being responsible for a majority of the costs of the collaboration development plan, our annual funding obligation for collaboration development being limited to $125 million, Nektar retaining a 65% profit interest in NKTR-214, and recording global revenue for NKTR-214 commercial sales. We and BMS are jointly developing NKTR-214 under an expansive joint development plan (the Collaboration Development Plan) that encompasses more than 20 indications across nine tumor types. Together, we have started registrational studies in first-line melanoma, first-line renal cell carcinoma, cisplatin ineligible, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, second-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (post- checkpoint inhibitor and chemotherapy). Many other registrational studies in additional tumor types and indications are planned to begin in 2019.  
 We are also conducting a broad array of development activities evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with other agents that have potential complementary mechanisms of action. Our strategic objective is to establish NKTR-214 as a key component of many I-O combination regimens with the potential to improve the standard of care in multiple oncology settings. On November 6, 2018, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) to evaluate several combination regimens in multiple cancer settings, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The combination regimens in this collaboration will evaluate NKTR-214 with avelumab, a human anti-PD-L1 antibody in development by Merck KGaA, and Pfizer; talazoparib, a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor developed by Pfizer; or enzalutamide, an androgen receptor inhibitor in development by Pfizer and Astellas Pharma Inc. In February 2019, we started a Phase 1 dose-escalation study with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. (Takeda) to evaluate NKTR-214 with Takeda’s investigational medicine, TAK-659, a dual inhibitor of both spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and FLT-3, in up to 40 patients with advanced non-hodgkin lymphoma. We are also planning a Phase 1 study this year in pancreatic cancer patients in collaboration with BioXcel Therapeutics to evaluate a triplet combination of NKTR-214, BXCL-701 (a small molecule immune-modulator, DPP 8/9), and avelumab being supplied to BioXcel by Pfizer and Merck KGaA. We are also working in collaboration with Vaccibody AS to evaluate NKTR-214 in combination with Vaccibody’s personalized cancer neoantigen vaccine in a Phase 1 proof-of-concept study.
 Another key program in I-O, NKTR-262 is a small molecule agonist that targets toll-like receptors (TLRs) found on innate immune cells in the body. NKTR-262 is designed to stimulate the innate immune system and promote maturation and activation of antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells, which are critical to induce the body’s adaptive immunity and create antigen-
 4

specific cytotoxic T cells. NKTR-262 is being developed as an intra-tumoral injection in combination with systemic NKTR-214 in order to induce an abscopal response and achieve the goal of complete tumor regression in cancer patients treated with both therapies. The Phase 1 dose-escalation trial is currently ongoing.    
 NKTR-255 is a biologic that targets the interleukin-15 pathway in order to activate the body’s innate and adaptive immunity. Signaling of the IL-15 pathway enhances the survival and activity of natural killer (NK) cells and enhances survival of both effector and CD8 memory T cells. Preclinical findings suggest NKTR-255 has the potential to synergistically combine with antibody-dependent cellular toxicity molecules as well as enhance CAR-T therapies. NKTR-255 is currently advancing through preclinical development and we plan to file an investigational new drug (IND) application for NKTR-255 this year and begin the first Phase 1 dose-escalation trial in multiple myeloma.  
 Immunology
 We are currently developing NKTR-358, which is an investigational drug designed to correct the underlying immune system imbalance in the body that occurs in patients with autoimmune disease. The breakdown of mechanisms assuring recognition of self and non-self is what underlies all autoimmune diseases. A failure of the body’s self-tolerance mechanisms is known to result from pathogenic auto reactive T lymphocytes. By increasing the number of regulatory T cells (which are specific immune cells in the body that modulate the immune system and prevent autoimmune disease by maintaining self-tolerance), these pathogenic auto reactive T cells can be reduced and the proper balance of effector and regulatory T cells can be achieved to restore the body's self-tolerance mechanisms. There is consistent evidence that suboptimal regulatory T cell numbers and their lack of activity play a significant role in a myriad of autoimmune diseases. NKTR-358 is designed to optimally target the IL-2 receptor complex in order to stimulate proliferation and growth of regulatory T cells. NKTR-358 is being developed as a once or twice monthly self-administered injection for a number of autoimmune diseases. 
 On July 23, 2017, we entered into a worldwide license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) to co-develop NKTR-358. We received an initial payment of $150.0 million in September 2017 and are eligible for up to an additional $250.0 million for development and regulatory milestones. We are responsible for completing Phase 1 clinical development and certain drug product development and supply activities. We also share Phase 2 development costs with Lilly, with 75% of those costs borne by Lilly and 25% of the costs borne by us. We will have the option to contribute funding to Phase 3 development on an indication-by-indication basis, ranging from zero to 25% of the global Phase 3 development costs. We are eligible for tiered royalties on global sales up to the low twenties that escalate based upon our level of contribution to Phase 3 development costs and the level of global product annual sales. Lilly will be responsible for all costs of global commercialization and we will have an option to co-promote in the U.S. under certain conditions. In February 2017, we filed an IND for NKTR-358.  We have completed a Phase 1 dose-finding trial to evaluate single-ascending doses of NKTR-358 in approximately 100 healthy patients. Results from this study demonstrated a multiple-fold increase in regulatory T cells with no change in CD8 positive or natural killer (NK) cell levels and no dose-limiting toxicities observed. Data from this study are currently planned for presentation at the 2019 European Congress of Rheumatology Conference.  The Phase 1 multiple-ascending dose trial to evaluate NKTR-358 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was initiated in May 2018 and is currently enrolling patients. 
 Pain - NKTR-181 
 NKTR-181 (also known as oxycodegol) is a novel mu-opioid analgesic drug candidate that we are developing for chronic pain conditions. We have filed the new drug application (NDA) for NKTR-181 for the treatment of chronic low back pain in opioid-naïve adult patients and the current Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is August 29, 2019. If approved, we plan to commercialize NKTR-181 through a separate subsidiary company, optionally with one or more partners with commercialization infrastructure and expertise and one or more strategic capital partners.
 NKTR-181 met its primary and key secondary endpoints in the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy study that compared twice-daily dosing of NKTR-181 tablets to placebo in the treatment of over 600 patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain who were opioid-naïve. SUMMIT-07 evaluated four analgesic doses of NKTR-181 (100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg). Patients in the trial achieved an average pain score reduction of over 65% (from 6.73 at screening to 2.32 at randomization) during the dose titration period. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study demonstrated significantly improved chronic back pain relief with NKTR-181 compared to placebo (p=0.0019). Key secondary endpoints of the study also achieved high statistical significance. The study demonstrated that NKTR-181 had a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated. The 52-week long-term safety study, which we call SUMMIT-LTS, was completed in December 2017, and evaluated the long-term safety and tolerability of NKTR-181 in 638 patients (opioid-naïve and opioid-experienced) with moderate to severe chronic low pain or chronic non-cancer pain. The study showed that NKTR-181 had a favorable safety profile with analgesic effect maintained over 52-weeks.
 Additionally, on July 18, 2017, we announced positive top-line data for our pivotal human abuse potential study (HAP) for NKTR-181. The HAP study was designed to confirm and assess the relative oral abuse potential of NKTR-181, at its maximum analgesic therapeutic, dose (400 mg) studied in the SUMMIT-07 trial and at a supratherapeutic dose (3 times to 12 times greater than the 
 5

analgesic dose range of 100 mg to 400 mg used in the SUMMIT-07 trial), compared to common therapeutic doses of oxycodone (40 mg and 60 mg) in 54 healthy non-dependent recreational drug users. For the primary endpoint of Drug Liking, NKTR-181 (400 mg and 600 mg) rated less likable compared to oxycodone 40 mg and 60 mg (p<0.0001), and a supratherapeutic dose of NKTR-181 (1200 mg) rated less likable than oxycodone 60 mg (p=0.0071). Key secondary endpoints of Area Under Effect for Drug Liking (0-1 hours, 0-2 hours, 0-3 hours), Drug High and Take Drug Again scores also met statistical significance for all doses of NKTR-181 (1200 mg, 600 mg, 400 mg) compared to oxycodone (60 mg). 
 Oncology - ONZEALDTM
 ONZEALDTM (also known as NKTR-102, etirinotecan pegol) is our next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor proprietary drug candidate. In March 2015, we announced top-line data from a Phase 3 clinical study for ONZEALDTM, which we called the BEACON study, evaluating ONZEALDTM as a single-agent therapy for women with advanced metastatic breast cancer. The BEACON study compared ONZEALDTM to an active control arm comprised of a single chemotherapy agent of physician’s choice (TPC) in patients who were heavily pre-treated with a median of three prior therapies for metastatic disease. In a top-line analysis of 852 patients from the trial, ONZEALDTM provided a 2.1 month improvement in median overall survival over TPC (12.4 months for patients receiving ONZEALDTM compared to 10.3 months for patients receiving TPC). Based on a stratified log-rank analysis, the primary endpoint measuring the Hazard Ratio (HR) for survival in the ONZEALDTM group compared to the active control arm was 0.87 with a p-value of 0.08, which did not achieve statistical significance. Secondary endpoints in the BEACON study included objective response rate and progression-free survival, which did not achieve statistical significance in the study. We also announced that we observed a significant overall survival benefit in two pre-specified subgroup populations—patients with a history of brain metastases and patients with baseline liver metastases at study entry. 
  Based on meetings with the European Union (EU) health authorities, in June 2016, we filed a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for conditional approval of ONZEALDTM for adult patients with advanced breast cancer who have brain metastases and began enrolling in the ATTAIN study, which compared the overall survival in patients with breast cancer and brain metastases treated with ONZEALDTM versus physicians treatment of choice. On July 21, 2017, we were informed by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it had adopted a negative opinion for the conditional marketing authorization application for ONZEALDTM in the European Union. The Phase 3 study (ATTAIN) in breast cancer patients having brain metastases is ongoing. 
 Collaboration Partner Programs
 In 2014, we achieved the first approval of one of our proprietary drug candidates, MOVANTIK® (naloxegol), under a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca). MOVANTIK® is an oral peripherally-acting opioid antagonist, for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation, a side effect caused by chronic administration of prescription opioid pain medicines. AstraZeneca markets and sells MOVANTIK® in the United States in collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. (Daiichi Inc.). Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd. (Kirin) has exclusive marketing rights to MOVENTIG® (the naloxegol brand name in the EU) in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. 
 We have a collaboration with Baxalta Incorporated (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda) to develop and commercialize PEGylated drug candidates with the objective of providing new long-acting therapies for hemophilia patients. Under this collaboration, we worked with Baxalta to develop ADYNOVATE®, an extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for Hemophilia A based on ADVATE® [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)]. ADYNOVATE®, was first approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late 2015 for Hemophilia A. ADYNOVATE® has also been approved in the European Union, Japan, Korea, Canada, and certain other countries.  
 We also have a number of license, manufacturing and supply agreements with other leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including Amgen, Inc., Pfizer and UCB Pharma (UCB). More than 10 products using our PEGylation technology have received regulatory approval in the U.S. or the EU. There are also a number of other products in clinical development that incorporate our advanced polymer conjugate technologies.

Our Technology Platform
 As a leader in the polymer conjugation field, we have advanced our technology platform to include new advanced polymer technologies that can be tailored in specific and customized ways with the objective of optimizing and significantly improving the profile of a wide range of molecules, including many classes of drugs targeting numerous disease areas. Polymer conjugation or PEGylation has been a highly effective technology platform for the development of therapeutics with significant commercial success, such as Amgen’s Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) and UCB’s CIMZIA (certolizumab pegol). Nearly all of the PEGylated drugs approved over the last fifteen years were enabled with our PEGylation technology through our collaborations and licensing partnerships with a number of well-known biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. PEGylation is a versatile technology as a result of polyethylene glycol (PEG) being a water soluble, amphiphilic, non-toxic, non-immunogenic compound that has been shown to safely clear from the body. Its primary use to date has been in currently approved biologic drugs to favorably alter their pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties. However, in spite of its widespread success in commercial drugs, there are some limitations with the first-generation PEGylation approaches that have been used with biologics. For example, these techniques cannot be used successfully to create small molecule drugs which could potentially benefit from the application of the technology. Other limitations of the early applications of PEGylation technology include sub-optimal bioavailability and bioactivity, and its limited ability to be used to fine-tune properties of the drug, as well as its inability to be used to create oral drugs.
 With our expertise and proprietary technology in polymer conjugation, we have created the next generation of PEGylation technology. Our advanced polymer conjugation technology platform is designed to overcome the limitations of the first generation of the technology platform and to allow the platform to be utilized with a broader range of molecules across many therapeutic areas. We have also developed robust manufacturing processes for generating second generation PEGylation reagents that allow us to utilize the full potential of these newer approaches.
 Our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms have the potential to offer one or more of the following benefits:
  
• | improve efficacy or safety of a drug as a result of better pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, longer half-life and sustained exposure of the drug;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve targeting or binding affinity of a drug to its target receptors with the potential to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity or drug resistance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve solubility of a drug;
--+------------------------------


• | enable oral administration of parenterally-administered drugs, or drugs that must be administered intravenously or subcutaneously, and increase oral bioavailability of small molecules;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | prevent drugs from crossing the blood-brain barrier, or reduce their rate of passage into the brain, thereby limiting undesirable central nervous system effects;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduce first-pass metabolism effects of certain drug classes with the potential to improve efficacy, which could reduce the need for other medicines and reduce toxicity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduce the rates of drug absorption and of elimination or metabolism by improving stability of the drug in the body and providing it with more time to act on its target;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | differentially alter binding affinity of a drug for multiple receptors, improving its selectivity for one receptor over another; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduce immune response to certain macromolecules with the potential to prolong their effectiveness with repeated doses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have a broad range of approaches that we may use when designing our own drug candidates, some of which are further described below.
 Large Molecule Pro-Drug Releasable Polymer Conjugates (Cytokines) 
 Our customized approaches with large molecule polymer conjugates have expanded to include a new approach with biologics, in particular cytokines, which utilizes the polymer as a means to bias action to a certain receptor or receptor sub-type. In addition, a cytokine’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended. An example of this is NKTR-214, which is a CD122-preferential IL-2 pathway agonist designed to provide rapid activation and proliferation of cancer-killing CD8+ effector T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, without over-activating the immune system, with an every two or every three-week dosing schedule.

Large Molecule Polymer Conjugates (Proteins and Peptides)
 Our customized approaches with large molecule polymer conjugates have enabled numerous successful PEGylated biologics on the market today. Based on our knowledge of the technology and biologics, our scientists have designed novel hydrolyzable linkers that in many cases can be used to optimize bioactivity. Through rational drug design, a protein or peptide’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended. An example of this is Baxalta’s ADYNOVATE®, a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein, which was approved by the FDA in November 2015 for use in adults and adolescents, aged 12 years and older, who have Hemophilia A. In December 2016, the FDA expanded the approval of ADYNOVATE® for use in surgical settings for both adults and pediatric patients, and also for the treatment of Hemophilia A in pediatric patients under 12 years of age.
 More recently, our scientists have shown that we can also optimize relative receptor binding characteristics of large molecule conjugates. For instance, the cytokine IL-2 has two different receptor complexes in the body that cause opposing effects on the immune system. We have engineered different novel conjugates of IL-2 with optimized differential receptor binding to the IL-2 receptor categories in the immune system. By biasing the receptor binding of these molecules in complementary ways, we have made two different drug candidates: NKTR-214, which selectively activates effector T cells, which kill tumors; and NKTR-358, which selectively activates regulatory T cells, which can reduce the pathological immune activation that underlies many autoimmune diseases.
 Small Molecule Stable Polymer Conjugates
 Our customized approach for small molecule polymer conjugates allows for the fine-tuning of the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of small molecule oral drugs to potentially increase their therapeutic benefit. In addition, this approach can enable oral administration of subcutaneously or intravenously delivered small molecule drugs that have low bioavailability when delivered orally. The benefits of this approach can also include: improved potency, modified biodistribution with enhanced pharmacodynamics, and reduced transport across specific membrane barriers in the body, such as the blood-brain barrier. An example of reducing transport across the blood-brain barrier is MOVANTIK®, an orally-available peripherally-acting opioid antagonist that is approved in the United States and the EU. An additional example of the application of membrane transport, specifically slowing transport across the blood-brain barrier is NKTR-181, an orally-available mu-opioid analgesic molecule for which an NDA for the treatment of chronic low back pain in opioid-naïve adult patients was accepted by the FDA for review.
Small Molecule Pro-Drug Releasable Polymer Conjugates
 The pro-drug polymer conjugation approach can be used to optimize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a small molecule drug to substantially increase its efficacy and improve its side effect profile. We are currently using this platform with oncolytics, which typically have sub-optimal half-lives that can limit their therapeutic efficacy. With our releasable polymer conjugate technology platform, we believe that these drugs can be modulated for programmed release within the body, optimized bioactivity and increased sustained exposure of active drug to tumor cells in the body. 
Antibody Fragment Polymer Conjugates
 This approach uses a large molecular weight PEG conjugated to antibody fragments in order to potentially improve their toxicity profile, extend their half-life and allow for ease of synthesis with the antibody. The specially designed PEG replaces the function of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of full length antibodies with a branched architecture PEG with either stable or degradable linkage. This approach can be used to reduce antigenicity, reduce glomerular filtration rate, enhance uptake by inflamed tissues, and retain antigen-binding affinity and recognition. There is currently one approved product on the market that utilizes our technology with an antibody fragment, CIMZIA® (certoluzimab pegol), which was developed by our partner UCB and is approved for the treatment of Crohn’s Disease and ankylosing spondylitis in the U.S., axial spondyloarthritis in the EU and psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in the U.S. and EU.
Our Strategy
 The key elements of our business strategy are described below:
 Advance Our Proprietary Clinical Pipeline of Drug Candidates that Leverage Our Advanced Polymer Conjugate Platform
 Our objective is to create value by advancing our lead drug candidates through various stages of clinical development. To support this strategy, we have significantly expanded and added expertise to our internal research, preclinical, clinical development and regulatory departments. A key component of our development strategy is to potentially reduce the risks and time associated with drug development by capitalizing on the known safety and efficacy of existing drugs and drug candidates as well as established pharmacologic targets and drugs directed to those targets. For many of our novel drug candidates, we may seek to study the drug candidates in indications for which the parent drugs have not been studied or approved. We believe that the improved characteristics 
 8

of our drug candidates will provide meaningful benefit to patients compared to the existing therapies. In addition, in certain instances we have the opportunity to develop new treatments for patients for which the parent drugs are not currently approved.
 Ensure Future Growth of our Proprietary Pipeline through Internal Research Efforts and Advancement of our Preclinical Drug Candidates into Clinical Trials
 We believe it is important to maintain a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build on the value of our business. Our discovery research organization is continuing to identify new drug candidates by applying our technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas. We continue to advance our most promising research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective of advancing these early-stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
Selectively Enter into Strategic Collaboration Agreements 
 We decide on a drug candidate-by-drug candidate basis, how far to advance clinical development (e.g. Phase 1, 2 or 3) and whether to commercialize products on our own, or seek a partner, or pursue a combination of these approaches. When we determine to seek a partner, our strategy is to evaluate the potential combination of that partner’s drug with our own and to selectively access a partner’s development, regulatory, or commercial capabilities with the structure of the collaboration depending on factors such as economic risk sharing, the cost and complexity of development, marketing and commercialization needs, therapeutic areas, potential for combination of drug programs, and geographic capabilities.  
 
     Transition to a Fully-Integrated Specialty Biotechnology Company with a Commercial Capability in the I-O Therapeutic Area
 If we are successful with the development of NKTR-214 or one of our I-O drug candidates and one or more of them is approved, we plan to establish a commercial capability in the U.S. and other select major markets to market, sell and distribute these proprietary I-O therapies.  Under our BMS Collaboration Agreement, we retained significant global commercial rights to NKTR-214 including global co-promotion rights for all combinations of NKTR-214 with any BMS proprietary therapy and we lead global commercialization for all other NKTR-214 combination regimens.  We will also record all worldwide sales and revenue for NKTR-214 and we have final decision-making authority regarding the pricing of NKTR-214.  
 Continue to Build a Leading Intellectual Property Estate in the Field of Polymer Conjugate Chemistry across Therapeutic Modalities
 We are committed to continuing to build on our intellectual property position in the field of polymer conjugate chemistry. To that end, we have a comprehensive patent strategy with the objective of developing a patent estate covering a wide range of novel inventions, including among others, polymer materials, conjugates, formulations, synthesis, therapeutic areas, methods of treatment and methods of manufacture.

Overview of Nektar Proprietary Programs
 Immuno-oncology (I-O)
 NKTR-214 (bempegaldesleukin, cytokine immunostimulatory therapy) 
 NKTR-214 (also known as bempegaldesleukin) is a CD122-preferential IL-2 pathway agonist designed to provide rapid activation and proliferation of cancer-killing CD8+ effector T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, without over-activating the immune system.  NKTR-214 stimulates these cancer-killing immune cells in the body by targeting CD122-specific receptors found on the surface of these immune cells. CD122, which is also known as the Interleukin-2 receptor beta subunit, is a key signaling receptor that is known to increase proliferation of these CD8+ effector T cells. This receptor selectivity is intended to increase efficacy and improve safety over existing immunostimulatory cytokine drugs. 
 Under a research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in December 2015 we commenced a Phase 1 study to evaluate NKTR-214 as a monotherapy in a variety of tumor types to evaluate safety and efficacy, and define the recommended Phase 2 dose of NKTR-214 in patients with solid tumors. In addition, the study also assessed the safety profile of NKTR-214, the immunologic effect of NKTR-214 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and other immune activation markers in both blood and tumor tissue, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of NKTR-214.    
 The development program for NKTR-214 includes combinations with a number of therapeutic approaches where we believe there is a strong biologic rationale for complementary mechanisms of action. On September 21, 2016, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement with BMS, pursuant to which we and BMS collaborated to conduct Phase 1/2 clinical trials evaluating NKTR-214 and BMS’ human monoclonal antibody that binds PD-1, known as Opdivo® (nivolumab), as a potential combination treatment regimen in five tumor types and eight potential indications (each, a Combined Therapy Trial). In the first phase of the PIVOT-02 study, we evaluated the clinical benefit, safety, and tolerability of combining NKTR-214 with Opdivo® in thirty-eight patients. Interim data from the dose-escalation phase of the trial was presented at the 2017 SITC meeting in November 2017. We identified the recommended Phase 2 dose for NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo®. The second phase of the expansion cohorts, which now falls under the BMS Collaboration Agreement entered into on February 13, 2018, and described below, is evaluating the safety and efficacy of combining NKTR-214 with Opdivo®. Under the initial Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement, BMS was responsible for 50% of all out-of-pocket costs reasonably incurred in connection with third party contract research organization, laboratories, clinical sites and institutional review boards. Each party was otherwise be responsible for its own internal costs, including internal personnel costs, incurred in connection with each Combined Therapy Trial. 
 On February 13, 2018, we entered into the second agreement with BMS (the BMS Collaboration Agreement), pursuant to which we and BMS are jointly developing NKTR-214, including, without limitation, in combination with BMS’s Opdivo® (nivolumab) and Opdivo® plus Yervoy® (ipilimumab), and other compounds of BMS, us or any third party. The parties have agreed to jointly commercialize NKTR-214 on a worldwide basis. On April 3, 2018, the closing date of the transaction, BMS paid us a non-refundable upfront cash payment of $1.0 billion and purchased $850.0 million of our common stock at a purchase price of $102.60 per share pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (Purchase Agreement). We are eligible to receive additional cash payments of a total of up to $1.43 billion upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and a total of up to $350.0 million upon achievement of certain sales milestones. We will record all worldwide sales and revenue for NKTR-214. We will share global commercialization profits and losses with BMS for NKTR-214, with Nektar sharing 65% and BMS sharing 35% of the net profits and losses. BMS will lead commercialization for combinations of NKTR-214 with BMS proprietary medicines, and we will lead all other commercialization efforts for NKTR-214. We will have the final decision-making authority regarding the pricing for NKTR-214. NKTR-214 will be sold on a stand-alone basis and there will be no fixed-dose combinations or co-packaging without the consent of both parties.
 Under the BMS Collaboration Agreement, we and BMS will collaborate to develop and conduct clinical studies of NKTR-214 pursuant to a joint development plan, which includes a series of registration-enabling trials in more than 20 indications in nine tumor types and may be revised only upon mutual agreement of the parties. The parties share the development costs for NKTR-214 in combination regimens, with BMS generally responsible of 67.5% and Nektar generally responsible for 32.5% of the development costs, based on each party’s relative ownership interest in the compounds included in the regimens. For costs of producing NKTR-214, however, BMS is responsible for 35% and Nektar is responsible for 65% of costs. Our share of such development costs are limited to an annual cap of $125.0 million. Neither party will develop a therapy using an IL-2 agonist in combination with a small or large molecule that binds to the PD(L)-1 target (and in certain indications the anti-CTLA4 target), in indications included in the joint development plan (each, a Competing Combination), whether alone or in collaboration with any third party, during a limited exclusivity period from the closing date under the BMS Collaboration Agreement until the later of (i) the first commercial sale of NKTR-214 or (ii) the third anniversary of the closing date, but each party may develop a Competing Combination on its own (but not in collaboration with any third party) during the three years after the end of the foregoing limited exclusivity period. If a registration-enabling study included in the joint development plan does not have the first patient enrolled prior to the date which is 14 months from the closing date, subject to allowable delays, the indication covered by that study is no longer subject to the above exclusivity. Other 
 11

than as described above, Nektar may independently develop and commercialize NKTR-214 either alone or in combination with other Nektar proprietary compounds or third party compounds.
 Outside of the Collaboration Development Plan with BMS, we are also conducting a broad array of development activities evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with other agents that have potential complementary mechanisms of action. Our strategic objective is to establish NKTR-214 as a key component with many immuno-oncology combination regimens with the potential to raise the standard of care in multiple oncology settings:
  
• | On November 6, 2018, we entered into a clinical collaboration with Pfizer, Inc. to evaluate several combination regimens in multiple cancer settings, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The combination regimens in this collaboration will evaluate NKTR-214 with avelumab, a human anti-PD-L1 antibody in development by Merck KGaA and Pfizer; talazoparib, a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor developed by Pfizer; or enzalutamide, an androgen receptor inhibitor in development by Pfizer and Astellas Pharma Inc.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In February 2019, we started a Phase 1 dose-escalation study with Takeda to evaluate NKTR-214 with Takeda’s investigational medicine, TAK-659, a dual inhibitor of both spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and FLT-3, in up to 40 patients with advanced non-hodgkin lymphoma.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are planning a Phase 1 study this year in pancreatic cancer patients in collaboration with BioXcel to evaluate a triplet combination of NKTR-214, BXCL-701 (a small molecule immune-modulator, DPP 8/9), and avelumab (being supplied to BioXcel by Pfizer and Merck KGaA).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are also working in collaboration with Vaccibody AS to evaluate NKTR-214 with Vaccibody’s personalized cancer neoantigen vaccine in a Phase 1 proof-of-concept study.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 With our non-BMS clinical collaborations for NKTR-214, we generally share clinical development costs on a substantially pro-rata basis. We expect to continue to make significant and increasing investments exploring the potential of NKTR-214 with mechanisms of action that we believe are synergistic with NKTR-214 based on emerging scientific findings in cancer biology and preclinical development work
 In addition to these non-BMS clinical collaborations for NKTR-214, we intend to initiate further clinical development programs, on our own or in collaboration with other potential partners, to explore the potential of combining NKTR-214 with other therapies such as cancer vaccines (other than Vaccibody’s personalized cancer neoantigen vaccine), adoptive cell therapy, and other small molecules and biological agents in order to generate novel immuno-oncology approaches. 
 NKTR-262 
 NKTR-262 is a small molecule agonist that targets toll-like receptors (TLRs) found on innate immune cells in the body. NKTR-262 is designed to overcome the body’s dysfunction of antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells, which are critical to induce the body’s adaptive immunity and create antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells. NKTR-262 is being developed as a single intra-tumoral injection to be administered at the start of therapy with NKTR-214 in order to induce an abscopal response and achieve the goal of complete tumor regression in cancer patients treated with both therapies. We initiated enrollment of patients in the initial Phase 1/2 clinical study in April 2018, which we call the REVEAL study, and the dose-escalation portion of this clinical study is ongoing.   
 NKTR-255 
 NKTR-255 is a biologic that targets the interleukin-15 pathway in order to activate the body’s innate and adaptive immunity. Signaling of the IL-15 pathway enhances the survival and function of natural killer (NK) cells and induces survival of both effector and CD8 memory T cells. Native rhIL-15 is rapidly cleared from the body and must be administered frequently and in high doses limiting its utility due to toxicity. NKTR-255 is designed with IL-15 receptor alpha specificity to optimize biological activity and is uniquely engineered to provide optimal exposure and an improved safety profile.  Preclinical findings suggest NKTR-255 has the potential to synergistically combine with antibody dependent cellular toxicity molecules as well as enhance CAR-T therapies. NKTR-255 is currently advancing through preclinical development and we plan to file an IND for NKTR-255 this year and begin the first Phase 1 dose-escalation study in multiple myeloma.
 Immunology 
 NKTR-358 is designed to correct the underlying immune system imbalance in the body which occurs in patients with autoimmune disease. Current systemic treatments for autoimmune disease, including corticosteroids and anti-TNF agents, suppress the immune system broadly and come with severe side effects. NKTR-358 targets the CD25 sub-receptor in the interleukin-2 pathway in order to stimulate proliferation and growth of regulatory T cells, which are specific immune cells in the body that modulate the immune system and prevent autoimmune disease by maintaining self-tolerance.

On July 23, 2017, we entered into the Lilly Agreement, pursuant to which we and Lilly will co‑develop NKTR-358. Under the terms of the Lilly Agreement, we received an initial payment of $150.0 million in September 2017 and are eligible for up to $250.0 million in additional development and regulatory milestones. We are responsible for completing Phase 1 clinical development and certain drug product development and supply activities. We will also share Phase 2 development costs with Lilly, with 75% of those costs borne by Lilly and 25% of the costs borne by us. We will have the option to contribute funding to Phase 3 development on an indication-by-indication basis, ranging from zero to 25% of the global Phase 3 development costs. We are eligible to receive up to double-digit sales royalty rates that escalate based upon our contribution to Phase 3 development cost and the level of global product annual sales. Lilly will be responsible for all costs of global commercialization and we will have an option to co-promote in the U.S. under certain conditions.
 In February 2017, we filed an IND for NKTR-358. We have completed a Phase 1 dose-finding trial of NKTR-358 to evaluate single-ascending doses of NKTR-358 in approximately 100 healthy patients. Results from this study demonstrated a multiple-fold increase in regulatory T cells with no change in CD8 positive or natural killer cell levels and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Data from this study is currently planned for presentation at the 2019 European Congress of Rheumatology Conference. The Phase 1 multiple-ascending dose trial to evaluate NKTR-358 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was initiated in May 2018 and is currently enrolling patients.  
 Pain - NKTR-181 (mu-opioid analgesic molecule for chronic pain) 
 NKTR-181 (also known as oxycodegol) is an orally-available novel mu-opioid analgesic molecule in development as a long-acting analgesic to treat chronic pain. NKTR-181 is designed with the objective to address the abuse liability and serious central nervous system (CNS) side effects associated with current opioid therapies. NKTR-181 was created using Nektar’s proprietary polymer conjugate technology, which provides it with a long-acting profile and slows its entry into the CNS. The abuse deterrent properties of NKTR-181 are inherent to its novel molecular structure and do not rely on a formulation approach to prevent its conversion into a more abusable form of an opioid. In May 2012, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the NKTR-181 development program. 
 In June 2012, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of NKTR-181 in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the knee. The Phase 2 clinical study utilized a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal, enriched enrollment study design. The study enrolled 295 opioid-naïve patients with osteoarthritis of the knee who were not getting adequate pain relief from their current non-opioid pain medication. Patients who qualified during the baseline period entered a titration phase, during which they were titrated on NKTR-181 tablets administered orally twice-daily until a dose was reached that provided a reduction of at least 20% in the patient’s pain score as compared to the patient’s own baseline. Patients that achieved this level of analgesia were then randomized on a 1:1 basis to either continue to receive their analgesic dose of NKTR-181 or to receive placebo for up to 25 days. The primary endpoint of the study was the average change in a patient’s pain score from baseline to the end of the double-blind, randomized treatment period. 
 In the first half of 2013, we conducted a human abuse liability study, or HAL study, for NKTR-181. In this study, NKTR-181 had highly statistically significant lower “drug liking” scores and reduced “feeling high” scores as compared to oxycodone at all doses tested (p < 0.0001). On June 19, 2013, we presented data from the HAL study at the 2013 Annual Meeting of The College on Problems of Drug Dependence in San Diego, California. 
 On September 26, 2013, we announced results from this Phase 2 efficacy study. Of the 295 patients that entered the study, only nine patients (representing 3% of the patient population) were unable to achieve meaningful pain relief with NKTR-181. A total of 213 patients achieved an average 40% reduction in pain and entered the randomized phase of the study. NKTR-181 performed as expected as an opioid analgesic throughout the study with patients continuing to show a reduction in pain scores throughout the randomized phase of the study. However, patients who were randomized to placebo did not show the expected increase in pain scores observed in similar enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal studies. This unusual lack of a placebo rebound caused the Phase 2 study to miss the primary endpoint in the study.
 In October 2014, we engaged in an end-of-Phase 2 meeting for NKTR-181 with the FDA, which included discussions of the design of the Phase 3 clinical study program. We enrolled the first patient in the first Phase 3 efficacy study, which we call SUMMIT-07 in February 2015 and we completed enrollment in the study in the fourth quarter of 2016. In this study, we randomized patients with chronic low back pain in an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal design which included a qualifying screening period, an open-label titration period where NKTR-181 was given to all patients, followed by a 12-week double-blind randomized period where subjects were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either NKTR-181 or placebo. In January 2017, we started enrollment in a second human abuse liability study where we are assessing abuse liability of supra-therapeutic doses of NKTR-181 in order to further evaluate NKTR-181 for labeling and scheduling purposes. On March 20, 2017, we announced that NKTR-181 met its primary and key secondary endpoints in the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy study that compared twice-daily dosing of NKTR-181 tablets to placebo in the treatment of over 600 patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain who were new to opioid therapy (opioid-naïve). 
 13

SUMMIT-07 evaluated four analgesic doses of NKTR-181 (100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg). Patients in the trial achieved an average pain score reduction of over 65% (from 6.73 at screening to 2.32 at randomization) during the dose titration period. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study demonstrated significantly improved chronic back pain relief with NKTR-181 compared to placebo (p=0.0019). Key secondary endpoints of the study also achieved high statistical significance. The study demonstrated that NKTR-181 had a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated. 
 Additionally, on July 18, 2017, we announced positive top-line data for our pivotal human abuse potential study (HAP) for NKTR-181. The HAP study was designed to confirm and assess the relative oral abuse potential of NKTR-181, at its maximum analgesic therapeutic, dose (400 mg) studied in the SUMMIT-07 trial and at a supratherapeutic dose (3 times to 12 times greater than the analgesic dose range of 100 mg to 400 mg used in the SUMMIT-07 trial), compared to common therapeutic doses of oxycodone (40 mg and 60 mg) in 54 healthy non-dependent recreational drug users. For the primary endpoint of Drug Liking, NKTR-181 (400 mg and 600 mg) rated less likable compared to oxycodone 40 mg and 60 mg (p<0.0001), and a supratherapeutic dose of NKTR-181 (1200 mg) rated less likable than oxycodone 60 mg (p=0.0071). Key secondary endpoints of Area Under Effect for Drug Liking (0-1 hours, 0-2 hours, 0-3 hours), Drug High and Take Drug Again scores met statistical significance for all doses of NKTR-181 (1200 mg, 600 mg, 400 mg) compared to oxycodone (60 mg).
 The SUMMIT Phase 3 program also included a 52-week long-term safety study, which we call SUMMIT-LTS. This study evaluated the long-term safety and tolerability of NKTR-181 in 638 patients (opioid-naïve and opioid-experienced) with moderate to severe chronic low pain or chronic non-cancer pain. The study showed that NKTR-181 had a favorable safety profile and analgesic effect maintained over 52-weeks. On July 30, 2018, we announced that the NDA for NKTR-181 for the treatment of chronic low back pain in adult patients new to opioid therapy was accepted by the FDA for review. In February 2019, the FDA informed us it had adjusted the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date from May 29, 2019 to August 29, 2019. If approved, we are evaluating several strategic alternatives to commercialize NKTR-181 including, without limitation, establishing a separate subsidiary company or joint venture with one or more partners with commercial capabilities and/or strategic capital partners. Since we have not yet established a commercial launch capability for NTKR-181, if approved, there remains substantial risk and uncertainties related to successful and timely completion of this process. 
 According to a 2013 report from the World Health Organization, approximately 149 million work days are lost every year because of low back pain, with total costs estimated to be $100 to $200 billion a year (of which two-thirds is due to lost wages and lower productivity).  Opioids are considered to be the most effective therapeutic option for pain. However, opioids cause significant problems for physicians and patients because of their serious side effects such as respiratory depression and sedation, as well as the risks they pose for addiction, abuse, misuse, and diversion. The FDA has cited prescription opioid analgesics as being at the center of a major public health crisis of addiction, misuse, abuse, overdose and death. According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine 2016 report, there are 1.9 million Americans which have a substance use disorder involving prescription pain relievers. This same report attributes 18,893 overdose deaths in 2015 were related to prescription pain relievers. 
 Oncology - ONZEALDTM (next generation, long-acting topoisomerase I inhibitor)
 ONZEALDTM (previously known as NKTR-102 or etirinotecan pegol) is our next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor proprietary drug candidate. In 2015, we announced top-line data from a Phase 3 clinical study for ONZEALDTM, which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with ONZEALDTM), as a single-agent therapy for women with advanced metastatic breast cancer. The BEACON study compared ONZEALDTM to an active control arm comprised of a single chemotherapy agent of physician’s choice (TPC) in patients who were heavily pre-treated with a median of three prior therapies for metastatic disease. In a top-line analysis of 852 patients from the trial, ONZEALDTM provided a 2.1 month improvement in median overall survival over TPC (12.4 months for patients receiving ONZEALDTM compared to 10.3 months for patients receiving TPC). Based on a stratified log-rank analysis, the primary endpoint measuring the hazard ratio for survival in the ONZEALDTM group compared to the active control arm was 0.87 with a p-value of 0.08, which did not achieve statistical significance. Secondary endpoints in the BEACON study included objective response rate and progression-free survival, which did not achieve statistical significance in the study. We also announced that we observed a significant overall survival benefit in two pre-specified subgroups—patients with a history of brain metastases and patients with baseline liver metastases at study entry.
 Based on meetings with European Union (EU) health authorities, in June 2016, we filed a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for conditional approval of ONZEALDTM for adult patients with advanced breast cancer who have brain metastases and began enrolling patients in the ATTAIN study, which is comparing the overall survival in patients with breast cancer and brain metastases treated with ONZEALDTM versus physicians treatment of choice. On July 21, 2017, we were informed by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it had adopted a negative opinion for the conditional marketing authorization application for ONZEALDTM in the EU. The Phase 3 study (ATTAIN) in breast cancer patients having brain metastases is ongoing.

According to the American Cancer Society and World Health Organization, more than 1.4 million women worldwide are diagnosed with breast cancer globally every year. The chance of developing invasive breast cancer at some time in a woman’s life is a little less than one in eight (approximately 12%). In 2017, the American Cancer Society estimated there will be 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed in the U.S. and about 40,610 women will die from breast cancer. Anthracyclines and taxanes are the among the most active and widely used chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer, but the increased use of these agents at an early stage of disease often renders tumors resistant to these drugs by the time the disease recurs, thereby reducing the number of treatment options for metastatic disease. There are currently no FDA-approved topoisomerase I inhibitors indicated to treat breast cancer.

 With respect to all of our collaboration and license agreements with third parties, please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including without limitation, “We are a party to numerous collaboration agreements and other significant agreements which contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”
 Overview of Collaboration Partner Programs
 We have a number of product candidates in clinical development and approved products in collaboration with our partners where we invented the drug candidate or where our collaboration partners have licensed our proprietary intellectual property to enable one of their drug candidates. Our agreements with collaboration partners may involve several elements including a technology license as well as the development, commercialization, and manufacturing and supply obligations. We typically receive consideration from our collaboration partners in the form of upfront payments, or milestone payments and royalties on sales. In certain cases, we also manufacture and supply our proprietary polymer materials to our partners.
 ADYNOVATE® (previously referred to as BAX 855), ADYNOVI® (brand name for ADYNOVATE® in Europe) and Longer-Acting Blood Clotting Proteins for Hemophilia A, Agreement with Subsidiaries of Baxalta Incorporated
 In September 2005, we entered into an exclusive research, development, license, manufacturing and supply agreement (Baxalta License Agreement) with certain subsidiaries of Baxalta (which has been acquired by Takeda), formerly Baxter before the separation of Baxalta from Baxter in July 2015, to develop products with an extended half-life for the treatment and prophylaxis of Hemophilia A patients using our proprietary PEGylation technology. The first product in this collaboration, ADYNOVATE® (previously referred to as BAX 855), is a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein. ADYNOVATE® is a full-length PEGylated longer-acting recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) that was developed to increase the half-life of ADVATE® (Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) Plasma/Albumin-Free Method). ADYNOVATE® was first approved by the FDA on November 30, 2015.  Since then it has been approved in one or more indications for Hemophilia A in the EU, Japan, and other countries around the world.
 We are entitled to $35.0 million of sales milestone payments, as well as royalties on net sales varying by product and country of sale. The royalties start in the mid-single digits for net sales of ADYNOVATE® up to $1.2 billion and then in the low teens for net sales exceeding $1.2 billion. Our right to receive these royalties in any particular country will expire upon the later of ten years after the first commercial sale of the product in that country or the expiration of patent rights in certain designated countries or in that particular country.
 In October 2017, we entered into a right to sublicense agreement with Baxalta, under which we granted to Baxalta the right to grant a nonexclusive sublicense to certain patents to a third party that were previously exclusively licensed to Baxalta under the Baxalta License Agreement. Under the right to sublicense agreement, Baxalta paid us $12.0 million in November 2017 and agreed to pay us single digit royalty payments based upon net sales of the third party products covered under the sublicense throughout the term of the right to sublicense agreement.
 Hemophilia A, also called factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency or classic hemophilia, is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective factor VIII, a clotting protein. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hemophilia occurs in approximately one in 5,000 live births and there are about 20,000 people with hemophilia in the US. All races and ethnic groups are affected. Hemophilia A is four times as common as Hemophilia B while more than half of patients with Hemophilia A have the severe form of hemophilia. In 2014, according to the Evaluate Group, sales of FVIII replacement products exceeded $6.0 billion globally.

MOVANTIK® and MOVENTIG® (brand name for MOVANTIK® in Europe), License Agreement with AstraZeneca AB
 In September 2009, we entered into a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca) pursuant to which we granted AstraZeneca a worldwide, exclusive, perpetual, royalty-bearing license under our patents and other intellectual property to develop, market and sell MOVANTIK®. MOVANTIK® was developed using our oral small molecule polymer conjugate technology and we advanced this drug through the completion of Phase 2 clinical studies prior to licensing it to AstraZeneca. MOVANTIK® is an orally-available peripherally-acting mu-opioid antagonist which is a medication for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC), which is a common side effect of prescription opioid medications. Opioids attach to specific proteins called opioid receptors. When the opioids attach to certain opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, constipation may occur. OIC is a result of decreased fluid absorption and lower gastrointestinal motility due to opioid receptor binding in the gastrointestinal tract.
 On September 16, 2014, the FDA approved MOVANTIK® as the first once-daily oral peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) medication for the treatment of OIC in adult patients with chronic, non-cancer pain. On December 9, 2014, the European Commission, or EC, granted Marketing Authorisation to MOVENTIG® (the naloxegol brand name in the EU) as the first once-daily oral PAMORA to be approved in the EU for the treatment of OIC in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to laxative(s). The EC’s approval applies to all 28 EU member countries plus Iceland and Norway. AstraZeneca launched the commercial sales of MOVANTIK® in the U.S. in March 2015 and MOVENTIG® in Germany, the first EU member country, in August 2015. Under the terms of our license agreement with AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca made an initial license payment of $125.0 million to us and has responsibility for all activities and bears all costs associated with research, development and commercialization for MOVANTIK®. We received milestone payments of $70.0 million and $25.0 million upon the acceptance of regulatory approval applications of MOVANTIK® by the FDA and the EMA, respectively, in 2013. We received an additional developmental milestone payment of $35.0 million upon the FDA’s approval of MOVANTIK® in 2014 and a total of $140.0 million upon commercial launches in 2015, including $100.0 million for MOVANTIK® in the U.S. and $40.0 million for MOVENTIG® in Germany. We are also entitled to up to $375.0 million in sales milestones for MOVANTIK® if the program achieves certain annual commercial sales levels and significant double-digit royalty payments starting at 20% of net sales in the U.S. and 18% of net sales in the EU and rest of world, varying by country of sale and level of annual net sales. On March 1, 2016, AstraZeneca announced that it had entered into an agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd. (Kirin), granting Kirin exclusive marketing rights to MOVENTIG® in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Nektar’s receipt of a 40% share of royalty payments made by Kirin to AstraZeneca will be financially equivalent to Nektar receiving high single-digit to low double-digit royalties depending on Kirin’s annual net sales levels. Our right to receive royalties (subject to certain adjustments) in any particular country will expire upon the later of (a) a specified period of time after the first commercial sale of the product in that country or (b) the expiration of patent rights in that particular country. AstraZeneca has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop one MOVANTIK® fixed-dose combination product and has the right to develop multiple products which combine MOVANTIK® with opioids.
 There are a number of patents relevant to MOVANTIK®, some of which are listed in the FDA’s “Orange Book.” The “Orange Book” currently lists six patents for MOVANTIK®. Four patents (i.e., U.S. Patent Nos. 7,056,500, 7,662,365, 7,786,133 and 9,012,469) are “composition of matter patents” - one of which has a patent expiry extending into 2032. In addition, two patents (i.e., U.S. Patent Nos. 8,067,431 and 8,617,530) are directed to methods of treatment.
 CIMZIA®, Agreement with UCB
 In December 2000, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement covering our proprietary PEGylation materials for use in CIMZIA® (certolizumab pegol) with Celltech Chiroscience Ltd., which was acquired by UCB in 2004. Under the terms of the agreement, UCB is responsible for all clinical development, regulatory, and commercialization expenses. We also manufacture and supply UCB with our proprietary PEGylation reagent used in the manufacture of CIMZIA® on a fixed price per gram. We were also entitled to receive royalties on net sales of the CIMZIA® product for the longer of ten years from the first commercial sale of the product anywhere in the world or the expiration of patent rights in a particular country. In February 2012, we sold our rights to receive royalties on future worldwide net sales of CIMZIA® effective as of January 1, 2012 until the agreement with UCB is terminated or expires. This sale is further discussed in Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our agreement with UCB Pharma expires upon the expiration of all of UCB’s royalty obligations, provided that the agreement can be extended for successive two year renewal periods upon mutual agreement of the parties. In addition, UCB may terminate the agreement should it cease the development and marketing of CIMZIA® and either party may terminate for cause under certain conditions.

MIRCERA® (C.E.R.A.) (Continuous Erythropoietin Receptor Activator), Agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. 
 In December 2000, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (Roche), which was amended and restated in its entirety in December 2005. Pursuant to the agreement, we license our intellectual property related to our proprietary PEGylation materials for the manufacture and commercialization of Roche’s MIRCERA® product. MIRCERA® is a novel continuous erythropoietin receptor activator indicated for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease in patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis. As of the end of 2006, we were no longer required to manufacture and supply our proprietary PEGylation materials for MIRCERA® under our original agreement. In February 2012, we entered into a toll-manufacturing agreement with Roche under which we manufactured our proprietary PEGylation material for MIRCERA®. Roche entered into the toll-manufacturing agreement with the objective of establishing us as a secondary back-up source on a non-exclusive basis through December 31, 2016. Under the terms of this agreement, Roche paid us an up-front payment of $5.0 million plus a total of $22.0 million in performance-based milestone payments upon our achievement of certain manufacturing readiness, validation and production milestones, including the delivery of specified quantities of PEGylation materials, all of which were successfully completed by the end of January 2013. In 2013, we delivered additional quantities of PEGylation materials used by Roche to produce PEGASYS® and MIRCERA® for total consideration of approximately $18.6 million. We were also entitled to receive royalties on net sales of the MIRCERA® product. In February 2012, we sold all of our future rights to receive royalties on future worldwide net sales of MIRCERA® effective as of January 1, 2012. This sale is further discussed in Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2016, we no longer had any continuing manufacturing or supply obligations under this MIRCERA® agreement.
 Macugen®, Agreement with Bausch Health Companies Inc., formerly Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.
 In 2002, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with Eyetech, Inc. (subsequently acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. or Valeant), pursuant to which we license certain intellectual property related to our proprietary PEGylation technology for the development and commercialization of Macugen®, a PEGylated anti-vascular endothelial growth factor aptamer currently approved in the U.S. and EU for age-related macular degeneration. Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive royalties on net product sales in any particular country for the longer of ten years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country or the duration of patent coverage. Our agreement with Valeant expires upon the expiration of our last relevant patent containing a valid claim. In addition, Valeant may terminate the agreement if marketing authorization is withdrawn or marketing is no longer feasible due to certain circumstances, and either party may terminate for cause if certain conditions are met.
 Somavert®, Agreement with Pfizer, Inc.
 In January 2000, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with Sensus Drug Development Corporation (subsequently acquired by Pharmacia Corp. in 2001 and then acquired by Pfizer, Inc. in 2003), for the PEGylation of Somavert® (pegvisomant), a human growth hormone receptor antagonist for the treatment of acromegaly. We currently manufacture our proprietary PEGylation reagent for Pfizer, Inc. on a price per gram basis. 
 Neulasta®, Agreement with Amgen, Inc.
 In July 1995, we entered into a non-exclusive supply and license agreement (the 1995 Agreement) with Amgen, Inc., pursuant to which we licensed our proprietary PEGylation technology to be used in the development and manufacture of Neulasta®. Neulasta® selectively stimulates the production of neutrophils that are depleted by cytotoxic chemotherapy, a condition called neutropenia that makes it more difficult for the body to fight infections. On October 29, 2010, we amended and restated the 1995 Agreement by entering into a supply, dedicated suite and manufacturing guarantee agreement (the 2010 Agreement) and an amended and restated license agreement with Amgen Inc. and Amgen Manufacturing, Limited (together referred to as Amgen). Under the terms of the 2010 Agreement, we guarantee the manufacture and supply of our proprietary PEGylation materials (Polymer Materials) to Amgen in an existing manufacturing suite to be used exclusively for the manufacture of Polymer Materials for Amgen in our manufacturing facility in Huntsville, Alabama. This supply arrangement is on a non-exclusive basis (other than the use of the manufacturing suite and certain equipment) whereby we are free to manufacture and supply the Polymer Materials to any other third party and Amgen is free to procure the Polymer Materials from any other third party. Under the terms of the 2010 Agreement, we received a $50.0 million upfront payment in return for guaranteeing supply of certain quantities of Polymer Materials to Amgen and the Additional Rights described below, and Amgen will pay manufacturing fees calculated based on fixed and variable components applicable to the Polymer Materials ordered by Amgen and delivered by us. Amgen has no minimum purchase commitments. If quantities of the Polymer Materials ordered by Amgen exceed specified quantities (with each specified quantity representing a small portion of the quantity that we historically supplied to Amgen), significant additional payments become payable to us in return for guaranteeing supply of additional quantities of the Polymer Materials.
 The term of the 2010 Agreement runs through October 29, 2020. In the event we become subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, we cease to own or control the manufacturing facility in Huntsville, Alabama, we fail to manufacture and supply the 
 18

Polymer Materials or certain other events occur, Amgen or its designated third party will have the right to elect, among certain other options, to take title to the dedicated equipment and access the manufacturing facility to operate the manufacturing suite solely for the purpose of manufacturing the Polymer Materials (Additional Rights). Amgen may terminate the 2010 Agreement for convenience or due to an uncured material default by us. Either party may terminate the 2010 Agreement in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party.
 Dapirolizumab Pegol
 In 2010, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with UCB Pharma S.A., (UCB) under which we granted UCB a worldwide, exclusive license to certain of our proprietary PEGylation technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize an anti-CD40L PEGylated Fab being developed by UCB and their partner Biogen Idec, for the treatment of autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythemastosus (SLE). In 2014, UCB and Biogen completed a Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in approximately 24 patients with SLE. Data from the study was published in September 2015 at the Annual American College of Rheumatology Meeting and showed that multiple administrations of dapirolizumab pegol given over 12 weeks were well-tolerated and the safety profile supported further development of the compound. Exploratory analyses from the same study showed greater improvement in clinical measures of disease activity in the dapriolizumab pegol group versus placebo. In 2016, UCB initiated a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging Phase 2 clinical study followed by an observational period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of patients with moderately to severely active SLE receiving stable standard of care medications. In October 2018, UCB announced that the primary endpoint of the study to demonstrate a dose response at 24 weeks on the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) was not met and stated that it and Biogen will continue to further evaluate these data while assessing potential next steps.
PEGPH20, Agreement with Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc.
 In December 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Halozyme pursuant to which we granted Halozyme a worldwide, limited exclusive license to certain of our proprietary PEGylation technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize particular products that use our proprietary PEGylation materials linked only with certain qualifying hyaluronidase protein molecules including PEGPH20. According to Halozyme, certain cancers, including pancreatic, breast, colon and prostate, have been shown to accumulate high levels of hyaluronan (HA). Halozyme’s FDA-approved, HYLENEX® recombinant human hyaluronidase, rHuPH20, is administered subcutaneously and temporarily and reversibly degrades HA to facilitate the absorption and dispersion of other injected drugs or fluids and for subcutaneous fluid administration. However, rHuPH20 acts only locally at the injection site, is rapidly inactivated in the body, and does not survive in the blood. PEGPH20 is an investigational PEGylated form of rHuPH20, under development by Halozyme to increase the half-life of the compound in the blood and allow for intravenous administration. Halozyme is currently evaluating PEGPH20 in a Phase 3 clinical study combining PEGPH20 with ABRAXANE® (nab-paclitaxel) and gemcitabine in stage IV pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) (HALO 301), in Phase 1b clinical testing for PEGPH20 with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer (HALO 101), in Phase 1b/2 clinical testing for PEGPH20 with HALAVEN® (eribulin) in patients treated with up to two lines of prior therapy for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, in Phase 1b/2 clinical testing for PEGPH20 with Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in patients with previously treated metastatic PDA, in Phase 1b/2 clinical testing for PEGPH20 with Tecentriq in patients with gastric cancer and in Phase 1b/2 clinical testing for PEGPH20 with Tecentriq in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and gall bladder cancer (HALO 110-101/MATRIX). We are entitled to future development milestones and royalties on net sales subject to reduction in the absence of patent coverage. Our right to receive royalties in any particular country will expire upon the later of twelve years after first commercial sale of the product or expiration of patent rights in the particular country. We also manufacture and supply Halozyme with clinical and future commercial supply of our proprietary PEGylation materials used in the manufacture of PEGPH20.Government Regulation
 Product Development and Approval Process
 The research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of products using our technologies are subject to regulation by the FDA and by comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. These national agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing (in vitro, in animals, and in human clinical trials), manufacture, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, marketing, advertising and promotion of our products.
 The approval process required by the FDA before a product using any of our technologies may be marketed in the U.S. depends on whether the chemical composition of the product has previously been approved for use in other dosage forms. If the product is a new chemical entity that has not been previously approved, the process includes the following:
  
• | extensive preclinical laboratory and animal testing;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an IND prior to commencing clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 19

 
• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for the intended indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extensive pharmaceutical development for the characterization of the chemistry, manufacturing process and controls for the active ingredient and drug product; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for approval of a drug, a Biological License Application (BLA) for approval of a biological product or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) or Premarket Notification 510(k) for a medical device product (a 510(k)).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If the active chemical ingredient has been previously approved by the FDA, the approval process is similar, except that certain preclinical tests, including those relating to systemic toxicity normally required for the IND and NDA or BLA, and clinical trials, may not be necessary if the company has a right of reference to existing preclinical or clinical data under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) or is eligible for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA or the biosimilars provisions of the Public Health Services Act.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and animal studies to assess the safety and efficacy of the product and its chosen formulation. Preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA good laboratory practices (GLP) regulations. The results of the preclinical tests for drugs, biological products and combination products subject to the primary jurisdiction of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and are reviewed by the FDA before clinical trials can begin. Clinical trials may begin 30 days after receipt of the IND by the FDA, unless the FDA raises objections or requires clarification within that period. Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified, identified medical investigator according to a protocol submitted in the IND for FDA review. Drug products to be used in clinical trials must be manufactured according to current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with protocols that detail the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety and product efficacy as well as other criteria to be evaluated in the study. Each protocol is submitted to the FDA in the IND.
 Apart from the IND process described above, each clinical study must be reviewed by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the IRB must be kept current with respect to the status of the clinical study. The IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, the potential risks to subjects participating in the trial and the possible liability to the institution where the trial is conducted. The IRB also reviews and approves the informed consent form to be signed by the trial participants and any significant changes in the clinical study.
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases. Phase 1 involves the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects (in most cases) and the product generally is tested for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, absorption, metabolism and excretion. Phase 2 involves studies in a limited patient population to:
  
• | determine the preliminary efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | determine dosage and regimen of administration; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 If Phase 2 trials demonstrate that a product appears to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to evaluate the further clinical efficacy and safety of the drug and formulation within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites and in large enough trials to provide statistical proof of efficacy and tolerability. The FDA, the clinical trial sponsor, the investigators or the IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time if any one of them believes that study participants are being subjected to an unacceptable health risk. In some cases, the FDA and the drug sponsor may determine that Phase 2 trials are not needed prior to entering Phase 3 trials.
 Following a series of formal meetings and communications between the drug sponsor and the regulatory agencies, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as an NDA or BLA for approval of the marketing and commercial shipment of the drug product. The FDA may deny approval if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or pharmaceutical testing or requirements. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy all of the criteria for approval. Additionally, the approved labeling may narrowly limit the conditions of use of the product, including the intended uses, or impose warnings, precautions or contraindications which could significantly limit the potential market for the product. Further, as a condition of approval, the FDA may impose post-market surveillance, or Phase 4, studies or risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. Product approvals, once obtained, may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety concerns arise after the product reaches the market. The FDA may require additional post-marketing clinical testing and pharmacovigilance programs to monitor the effect of drug products that have been commercialized and has the power to prevent or limit future marketing of the product based on the results of 
 20

such programs. After approval, there are ongoing reporting obligations concerning adverse reactions associated with the product, including expedited reports for serious and unexpected adverse events.
 Each manufacturing establishment producing the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product for the U.S. market must be registered with the FDA and typically is inspected by the FDA prior to NDA or BLA approval of a drug product manufactured by such establishment. Such inspections are also held periodically after the commercialization. Establishments handling controlled substances must also be licensed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Manufacturing establishments of U.S. marketed products are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements. They are also subject to U.S. federal, state, and local regulations regarding workplace safety, environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others.
 In situations where our partners are responsible for clinical and regulatory approval procedures, we may still participate in this process by submitting to the FDA a drug master file developed and maintained by us which contains data concerning the manufacturing processes for polymer conjugation materials or drug. For our proprietary products, we prepare and submit an IND and are responsible for additional clinical and regulatory procedures for product candidates being developed under an IND. The clinical and manufacturing, development and regulatory review and approval process generally takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Our ability to manufacture and market products, whether developed by us or under collaboration agreements, ultimately depends upon the completion of satisfactory clinical trials and success in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and equivalent foreign health authorities.
 Sales of our products outside the U.S. are subject to local regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs. Such requirements vary widely from country to country.
 In the U.S., under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. The company that obtains the first FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for a rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the designated condition for a period of seven years. In addition, the Orphan Drug Act provides for protocol assistance, tax credits, research grants, and exclusions from user fees for sponsors of orphan products. Once a product receives orphan drug exclusivity, a second product that is considered to be the same drug for the same indication generally may be approved during the exclusivity period only if the second product is shown to be “clinically superior” to the original orphan drug in that it is more effective, safer or otherwise makes a “major contribution to patient care” or the holder of exclusive approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Similar incentives also are available for orphan drugs in the EU.
 In the U.S., the FDA may grant Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation to a product candidate, which allows the FDA to expedite the review of new drugs that are intended for serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. Important features of Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation include a potentially reduced clinical program and close, early communication between the FDA and the sponsor company to improve the efficiency of product development.
 Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing 
 Sales of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval depend, in part, on the coverage and reimbursement status of those products. In the U.S., sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. 
 The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors may also refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. Further, private payors often follow the coverage and payment policies established by certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, which require manufacturers to comply with certain rebate, price reporting, and other obligations. For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which is part of the Medicaid program (a program for financially needy patients, among others), requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services under which the manufacturer agrees to report certain prices to the government and pay rebates to state Medicaid programs on outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients, as a condition for receiving federal reimbursement for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Further, in order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to 
 21

be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and examining the medical necessity and cost- effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the price of therapeutics have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement, among other controls. Adoption of price controls or other cost-containment measures could limit coverage for or the amounts that federal and state governments or private payors will pay for health care products and services, which could also result in reduced demand for our drug candidates or additional pricing pressures and affect our ultimate profitability. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover an approved product or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 If we obtain regulatory approval of our products, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration (a term interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, and credits), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money owed to the federal government;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes, referred to as the “HIPAA All-Payor Fraud Prohibition,” that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and disclose payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer, and that such information is subsequently made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state transparency reporting and compliance laws; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and which may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), enacted in 2010, expanded the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent 
 22

requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal health care programs for the product. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,781 and $21,916 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. 
 Legislative and Regulatory Landscape
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, marketing, coverage and reimbursement of products regulated by the FDA or other government agencies. In addition to new legislation, FDA and healthcare fraud and abuse and coverage and reimbursement regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Further, the 2016 Presidential and Congressional elections and subsequent developments have caused the future state of many core aspects of the current health care marketplace to be uncertain, as the new Presidential Administration and Congress have repeatedly expressed a desire to repeal all or portions of the Affordable Care Act. While specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent, there may be significant changes to the healthcare environment in the future that could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from therapeutic candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Furthermore, federal agencies, Congress, state legislatures, and the privacy sector have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit coverage for or the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, which could also result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures and affect our ultimate profitability.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 We own more than 275 U.S. and 850 foreign patents and a number of pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies. We have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our advanced polymer conjugate technologies and our proprietary product candidates. More specifically, our patents and patent applications cover polymer architecture, drug conjugates, formulations, methods of making polymers and polymer conjugates, methods of administering polymer conjugates, and methods of manufacturing polymers and polymer conjugates. Our patent portfolio contains patents and patent applications that encompass our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms. Our patent strategy is to file patent applications on innovations and improvements to cover a significant majority of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world. Generally, patents have a term of twenty years from the earliest priority date (assuming all maintenance fees are paid). In some instances, patent terms can be increased or decreased, depending on the laws and regulations of the country or jurisdiction that issued the patent.
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to, or disclose, our trade secrets. Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including but not limited to “We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.” In certain situations in which we work with drugs 
 23

covered by one or more patents, our ability to develop and commercialize our technologies may be affected by limitations in our access to these proprietary drugs. Even if we believe we are free to work with a proprietary drug, we cannot guarantee that we will not be accused of, or determined to be, infringing a third party’s rights and be prohibited from working with the drug or found liable for damages. Any such restriction on access or liability for damages would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues. There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be held valid and enforceable in a court of law. Even for patents that are held valid and enforceable, the legal process associated with obtaining such a judgment is time consuming and costly. Additionally, issued patents can be subject to opposition or other proceedings that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant or broad coverage). Further, our competitors may be able to circumvent and otherwise design around our patents. Even if a patent is issued and enforceable, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire early and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following the commercialization of products encompassed by our patent. We may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in a loss of the patent and/or substantial cost to us. Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including without limitation, “If any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection.”
 U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights exist that are owned by third parties and relate to pharmaceutical compositions and reagents, and equipment and methods for preparation, packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, of these rights will be considered relevant to our technology by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our partners against any such claims. Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the U.S. and abroad and could result in the award of substantial damages. In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our partners may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternative technology. The failure to obtain licenses if needed may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including without limitation, “We may not be able to obtain intellectual property licenses related to the development of our drug candidates on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all.”
 It is our policy to require our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors who receive confidential information from us to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. The agreements provide that all inventions conceived by an employee shall be our property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
 Customer Concentrations
 Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements with partners, under which we may receive a combination of revenue elements including up-front payments for licensing agreements, milestone payments based on clinical progress, regulatory progress or net sales achievements, royalties or product sales revenue. Our revenues are concentrated among a limited number of collaboration partners under long-term arrangements. In particular, our collaboration arrangements with BMS and Lilly represent 89% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 42% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, and these arrangements provide for the most significant portion of our potential future development and regulatory milestones. The relative portion of such revenues in any particular year, however, is dependent upon the mix of any milestone or other license revenues recognized and volume of recurring royalty revenues and product sales. Additionally, we derive substantially all of our cash royalty revenue from our collaboration arrangements with Takeda for ADYNOVATE®/ADYNOVITM and AstraZeneca for MOVANTIK®/MOVENTIG® and we derive the significant majority of our product sales from two other partners.
 Backlog
 Pursuant to our collaboration agreements, we manufacture and supply our proprietary polymer conjugation materials. Inventory is produced and sales are made pursuant to customer purchase orders for delivery generally based on rolling four to eight quarter forecasts, of which at least two quarters are generally binding. Our backlog is not significant. In light of industry practice and our own experience, we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results.

Competition
 Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is intense and characterized by aggressive research and development and rapidly-evolving science, technology, and standards of medical care throughout the world. We frequently compete with pharmaceutical companies and other institutions with greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales, manufacturing and managerial capabilities. We face competition from these companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relationships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies.
Science and Technology Competition
 We believe that our proprietary and partnered products will compete with others in the market on the basis of one or more of the following parameters: efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost. We face intense science and technology competition from a multitude of technologies seeking to enhance the efficacy, safety and ease of use of approved drugs and new drug molecule candidates. A number of the drug candidates in our pipeline have direct and indirect competition from large pharmaceutical companies and biopharmaceutical companies. With our advanced polymer conjugate technologies, we believe we have competitive advantages relating to factors such as efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost for certain applications and molecules. We constantly monitor scientific and medical developments in order to improve our current technologies, seek licensing opportunities where appropriate, and determine the best applications for our technology platforms.
 In the fields of advanced polymer conjugate technologies, our competitors include Biogen Idec Inc., Crealta Pharma, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd., Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SunBio Corporation, NOF Corporation, and Novo Nordisk A/S (assets formerly held by Neose Technologies, Inc.). Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies may also be developing advanced polymer conjugate technology or technologies intended to deliver similar scientific and medical benefits. Some of these companies license intellectual property or PEGylation materials to other companies, while others apply the technology to create their own drug candidates. 
 Product and Program Specific Competition
 NKTR-181 (mu-opioid analgesic molecule for chronic pain)
 There are numerous companies developing pain therapies designed to have less abuse potential primarily through formulation technologies and techniques applied to existing pain therapies. Potential competitors include Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cara Therapeutics, Inc., Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., Egalet Ltd, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Endo Health Solutions Inc., KemPharm, Inc., Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer, Purdue Pharma L.P., and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.
 NKTR-214 (bempegaldesleukin)(CD122-preferential IL-2 pathway agonist) 
 There are numerous companies engaged in developing immunotherapies to be used alone, or in combination, to treat a wide range of oncology indications targeting both solid and liquid tumors. In particular, we expect to compete with therapies with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILS, chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells, or CAR-T, cytokine-based therapies, and checkpoint inhibitors. Potential competitors in the TIL and CAR-T space include Gilead Sciences, Inc. (through its acquisition of Kite Pharma)/NCI, Apeiron Biologics, Philogen S.p.A., IRX Therapeutics, Anaveon AG, and Adaptimmune LLC. In the cytokine-based therapies space, potential competitors include Novartis, Alkermes, Altor Bioscience, Eli Lilly & Co. (through its acquisition of Armo Biosciences), Roche, and Synthorx, Inc., and in the checkpoint inhibitor space potential competitors include Tesaro, Inc., Macrogenics, Inc., Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Roche.  
 NKTR-358 (IL-2 conjugate regulator T Cell stimulator)
 There are a number of competitors in various stages of clinical development that are working on programs which are designed to correct the underlying immune system imbalance in the body due to autoimmune disease. In particular, we expect to compete with therapies that could be cytokine-based therapies (Symbiotix, LLC and Tizona Therapeutics), regulatory T cell therapies (Targazyme, Inc., Caladrius BioSciences, Inc., and Tract Therapeutics, Inc.), or IL-2 based therapies (Amgen, Inc.).  
 ONZEALDTM (next-generation, long acting topoisomerase I inhibitor)
 There are a number of chemotherapies and cancer therapies approved today and in various stages of clinical development for advanced breast cancer. These therapies are only partially effective in treating advanced or metastatic breast cancer and none of them have a specific indication in either the U.S. or Europe for treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer and co-existing brain metastases. These therapies include but are not limited to: Abraxane® (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin bound)), Afinitor® (everolimus), Ellence® (epirubicin), Gemzar® (gemcitabine), Halaven® (eribulin), Herceptin®
25

(trastuzumab), Ixempra® (ixabepilone), Navelbine® (vinolrebine), Xeloda® (capecitabine) and Taxotere® (docetaxel). Major pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with approved drugs or drugs in development for these cancers include Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eisai, Inc., Roche Holding Group (including its Genentech subsidiary), GlaxoSmithKline plc, Pfizer, Inc., Eli Lilly & Co., Sanofi Aventis S.A., and others.
 MOVANTIK® (previously referred to as naloxegol and NKTR-118) (orally-available peripheral opioid antagonist)
 There are no other once-daily oral drugs that act specifically to block or reverse the action of opioids on receptors in the gastrointestinal tract which are approved specifically for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) or opioid bowel dysfunction (OBD) in patients with chronic, non-cancer pain. The only approved oral treatment for opioid-induced constipation in adults with chronic, non-cancer pain is a twice daily oral therapy called AMITIZA® (lubiprostone), which acts by specifically activating CIC-2 chloride channels in the gastrointestinal tract to increase secretions. AMITIZA® is marketed by Sucampo Pharmaceuticals and Takeda. There is also a subcutaneous treatment and an oral treatment known as RELISTOR® which is marketed by Bausch Health Companies Inc. (formerly, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., which previously acquired Salix) under a license from Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In 2014, RELISTOR® Subjectaneous Injection was approved by the FDA for adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain. On July 22, 2016, Relistor (methylnaltrexone bromide) oral tablets for the treatment of OCI in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain was approved by FDA. Other therapies used to treat OIC and OBD include over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners, such as docusate sodium, senna, and milk of magnesia. These therapies do not address the underlying cause of constipation as a result of opioid use and are generally viewed as ineffective or only partially effective to treat the symptoms of OIC and OBD.
 There are a number of companies developing potential products which are in various stages of clinical development and are being evaluated for the treatment of OIC and OBD in different patient populations. Potential competitors include Merck, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in collaboration with Actavis plc, Purdue Pharma L.P. in collaboration with Shionogi & Co., Ltd., Mundipharma Int. Limited, Theravance, Inc., Develco Pharma, Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. 
 ADYNOVATE® (previously referred to as BAX 855, PEGylated rFVIII)
 On June 6, 2014, the FDA approved Biogen Idec’s ELOCTATETM [antihemophilic factor (recombinant), Fc fusion protein] for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes, perioperative (surgical) management and routine prophylaxis in adults and children with Hemophilia A. ELOCTATETM is intended to be an extended half-life Factor VIII therapy with prolonged circulation in the body with the potential to extend the interval between prophylactic infusions. Prior to its 2014 approval, the fusion protein in ELOCTATETM was not used outside of the clinical trial setting for Hemophilia A patients. On August 31, 2018, Bayer Healthcare received FDA approval for JIVI® (antihemophilic factor (recombinant) PEGylated-aucl), an extended half-life Factor VIII for Hemophilia A treatment in patients 12 and older which became commercially available in the third quarter of 2018. In addition, on February 19, 2019, Novo Nordisk received FDA approval for ESPEROCT® [antihemophilic factor (recombinant), glycoPEGylated-exei] a glycoPEGylated Factor VIII product with an extended half-life for use in adults and children with Hemophilia A, and is expected to be commercially available in 2020.  The Bayer product and the Novo Nordisk product (upon launch) are competitors in the extended half-life Factor VIII market.
Research and Development
 Our total research and development expenditures can be disaggregated into the following significant types of expenses (in millions):
 
 
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
------------------------------------------+-------------------------+------
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | | 2016
Third party and direct materials costs | $ | 206.9 | | $ | 125.4 | | $ | 98.2 
Personnel, overhead and other costs | | 130.8 | | | 113.5 | | | 84.6 
Stock-based compensation and depreciation | | 61.8 | | | 29.6 | | | 21.0 
Research and development expense | $ | 399.5 | | $ | 268.5 | | $ | 203.8

Manufacturing and Supply
 We have a manufacturing facility located in Huntsville, Alabama that is capable of manufacturing our proprietary PEGylation materials for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The facility is also used to produce APIs to support the early phases of clinical development of our proprietary drug candidates. The facility and associated equipment are designed and operated to be consistent with all applicable laws and regulations. As we do not maintain the capability to manufacture biologics nor finished drug products for our development programs, we primarily utilize contract manufacturers to manufacture biologics and finished drug product for us. We 
 26

also utilize the services of contract manufacturers to manufacture APIs and finished drug products required for later phases of clinical development and eventual commercialization under all applicable laws and regulations. 
 We source drug starting materials for our manufacturing activities from one or more suppliers. For the drug starting materials necessary for our proprietary drug candidate development, we have agreements for the supply of such drug components with drug manufacturers or suppliers that we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands. However, from time to time, we source critical raw materials and services from one or a limited number of suppliers and there is a risk that if such supply or services were interrupted, it would materially harm our business. In addition, we typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis for early phase clinical development products and enter into long-term supply arrangements only for late stage products nearing regulatory approval for marketing authorization.
 Environment
 As a manufacturer of PEG reagents for the U.S. market, we are subject to inspections by the FDA and EPA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal, state and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations. We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations.
Employees and Consultants
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 618 employees, of which 493 employees were engaged in research and development, manufacturing, commercial operations and quality activities and 125 employees in general administration and business development. Of the 618 employees, 547 were located in the U.S. and 71 were located in India. We have a number of employees who hold advanced degrees, such as Ph.D. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.
 To complement our own expert professional staff, we utilize specialists in regulatory affairs, pharmacovigilance, process engineering, manufacturing, quality assurance and clinical development. These individuals include scientific advisors as well as independent consultants.
