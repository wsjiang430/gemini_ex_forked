  Item 1. Business
 
  Company Overview
 
  We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on identifying, acquiring, and commercializing novel products that address significant patient needs. We have multiple FDA-approved products on the market, and we seek to build a portfolio of novel therapeutics that serve large medical needs, across a range of conditions, through our in-house commercial team. Our commercial infrastructure consists of a U.S.-based specialty sales force and an international distribution network with presence in approximately fifty countries.
  
 We currently are focused on commercialization of four products, (i) Natesto®, a testosterone replacement therapy, or TRT, (ii) Tuzistra® XR, a codeine based antitussive, (iii) ZolpiMistTM, a short-term insomnia treatment and (iv), MiOXSYS®, a novel in vitro diagnostic system for male infertility assessment. In the future we will look to acquire additional commercial-stage or near-market products, including existing products we believe can offer distinct commercial advantages. Our management team’s prior experience has involved identifying both clinical-stage and commercial-stage assets that can be launched or re-launched to increase value, with a focused commercial infrastructure specializing in novel, niche products.
  
 Corporate History
  
 We were initially incorporated as Rosewind Corporation on August 9, 2002 in the State of Colorado.
  
 Vyrix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Vyrix, was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 18, 2013 and was wholly-owned by Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE American: AMPE), or Ampio, immediately prior to the completion of the Merger (defined below). Vyrix was previously a carve-out of the sexual dysfunction therapeutics business, including the late-stage men’s health product candidates, Zertane and Zertane-ED, from Ampio, that carve out was announced in December 2013. Luoxis Diagnostics, Inc., or Luoxis, was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 24, 2013 and was majority-owned by Ampio immediately prior to the completion of the Merger. Luoxis was initially focused on developing and advancing the RedoxSYS System. The MiOXSYS System was developed following the completed development of the RedoxSYS System.
  
 On March 20, 2015, Rosewind formed Rosewind Merger Sub V, Inc. and Rosewind Merger Sub L, Inc., each a wholly-owned subsidiary formed for the purpose of the Merger. On April 16, 2015, Rosewind Merger Sub V, Inc. merged with and into Vyrix and Rosewind Merger Sub L, Inc. merged with and into Luoxis, and Vyrix and Luoxis became subsidiaries of Rosewind. Immediately thereafter, Vyrix and Luoxis merged with and into Rosewind with Rosewind as the surviving corporation (herein referred to as the Merger). Concurrent with the closing of the Merger, Rosewind abandoned its pre-merger business plans, solely to pursue the specialty pharmaceuticals, devices, and diagnostics markets, focusing on large areas of medical need, including the business of Vyrix and Luoxis. When we discuss our business in this Report, we include the pre-Merger business of Luoxis and Vyrix.
  
 On June 8, 2015, we (i) reincorporated as a domestic Delaware corporation under Delaware General Corporate Law and changed our name from Rosewind Corporation to Aytu BioScience, Inc., and (ii) effected a reverse stock split in which each common stock holder received one share of common stock for each 12.174 shares outstanding. At our annual meeting of shareholders held on May 24, 2016, our shareholders approved (1) an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock from 300.0 million to 100.0 million, which amendment was effective on June 1, 2016, and (2) an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to affect a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-12 which became effective on June 30, 2016. At our special meeting of shareholders held on July 26, 2017, our shareholders approved an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to affect a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-20 which became effective on August 25, 2017. At our annual meeting of shareholders held on June 27, 2018, our shareholders approved another reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-20 which became effective on August 10, 2018. All share and per share amounts in this Report have been adjusted to reflect the effect of these reverse stock splits (hereafter referred to collectively as the “Reverse Stock Splits”).
  
  Our Products and Markets
  
 All of our products are sold and distributed through multiple channels, including direct sales to wholesalers or on a sell-through basis using third-party logistics enterprises.

  Natesto® (testosterone) nasal gel
  
 On July 1, 2016 we acquired the exclusive U.S. rights to Natesto (testosterone) nasal gel, from Acerus Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Acerus. Natesto is a patented, FDA-approved testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for hypogonadism (low testosterone) in men. Natesto offers multiple advantages over currently available TRTs and competes in a $1.8 billion market accounting for over 6.8 million prescriptions annually. It is the only TRT delivered via a nasal gel. Thus, Natesto does not carry a black box warning related to testosterone transference to a man’s female partner or children; as other topically (primarily gels and solutions) administered TRTs do; by virtue of their delivery directly onto the skin. Recent clinical trials demonstrate that Natesto achieves hypogonadism symptom improvement, while maintaining function of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) axis; and maintenance of reproductive parameters in patients.
  
 We are positioning Natesto as the ideal treatment solution for hypogonadal men with active, busy lifestyles as Natesto is discreet, portable, and easy to use, while delivering efficacy and a safety profile unique to the TRT product category. Natesto is also positioned for men who have previously been prescribed a TRT, including Androgel, and want a product with a different clinical profile available in a convenient, easy-to-use, effective therapeutic option. By gaining less than a 5% share of the current U.S. market (assuming similar pricing and reimbursement), a novel TRT product could achieve annual gross revenues in excess of $90.0 million.
  
 On July 29, 2019, we agreed to amend and restate the License and Supply Agreement with Acerus. The effectiveness of the amended Agreement is conditioned upon Acerus obtaining new financing within six months of signing of the amended Agreement. Aytu will continue to serve as the exclusive U.S. supplier to purchasers of Natesto, and Acerus will receive performance-based commissions on prescriptions generated by urology and endocrinology specialties. Acerus will assume regulatory and clinical responsibilities and associated expenses and will serve a primary role in the development of key opinion leaders in urology and endocrinology. Aytu will focus on commercial channel management, sales to wholesalers and other purchasing customers, and will direct sales efforts in all other physician specialties.
      Tuzistra® XR
  
 On November 2, 2018, we obtained an exclusive license of FDA-approved Tuzistra® XR from Tris Pharma, or Tris. Tuzistra XR is the only FDA-approved 12-hour codeine-based antitussive. Tuzistra XR is a prescription antitussive consisting of codeine polistirex and chlorpheniramine polistirex in an extended-release oral suspension.
  
  The cough and cold prescription market is in excess of $3 billion in sales and more than 30 – 35 million prescriptions. This market is dominated by short-acting treatments requiring 4 – 6 daily doses. Tuzistra utilizes a novel, patented extended release technology enabling 12-hour duration of antitussive effect, offering a significant dosing advantage over current codeine-based treatments.
  
 In addition to Tuzistra XR, we also obtained a license for a complementary antitussive product pending FDA approval.

  ZolpiMist™ (zolpidem tartrate oral spray)
  
 On June 11, 2018, we acquired an exclusive license for ZolpiMist from Magna Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Magna, which we formally launched through our U.S. sales force in early 2019. This agreement allows for our exclusive commercialization of ZolpiMist in the U.S. and the ability to sublicense the product for commercialization in Canada. The ZolpiMist license adds another unique, commercial-stage product to our product portfolio and provides our U.S. sales force with another novel product to sell to their already-called-on primary care (family medicine, internal medicine, general practice) physician targets. More than half of our sales force’s Natesto physician targets are primary care physicians, so there is a significant overlap in targets and opportunity to enable the sales force to efficiently sell multiple products to these prevalent, high-prescribing clinicians.
  
 ZolpiMist is an FDA-approved prescription product that is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia, and is the only oral spray formulation of zolpidem tartrate - the most widely prescribed prescription sleep aid in the U.S. ZolpiMist is commercially available and competes in the non-benzodiazepine prescription sleep aid category, a $1.8 billion prescription drug category with over 43 million prescriptions written annually. Thirty million prescriptions of zolpidem tartrate (Ambien®, Ambien® CR, Intermezzo®, Edluar®, ZolpiMist™, and generic forms of immediate-release, controlled release, and orally dissolving tablet formulations) are written each year in the U.S., representing almost 70% of the non-benzodiazepine sleep aid category. Approximately 2.5 million prescriptions are written annually for novel formulations of zolpidem tartrate products (controlled release and sublingual tablets).
 
  MiOXSYS®
  
 MiOXSYS is a rapid in vitro diagnostic system that performs a semen analysis test used to measure static oxidation-reduction potential, or sORP, in human semen. Our MiOXSYS system is a novel, point-of-care semen analysis system with the potential to become a standard of care in the diagnosis and management of male infertility. Male infertility is a prevalent and underserved condition, and oxidative stress (the core biological component measured by the MiOXSYS system) is widely implicated in its pathophysiology. MiOXSYS was developed from our previously developed oxidation-reduction potential research platform known as RedoxSYS®. Male infertility is often unexplained (idiopathic), and this idiopathic infertility is frequently associated with increased levels of oxidative stress in the semen. As such, having a rapid, easy-to-use diagnostic platform to measure oxidative stress may provide a practical way for reproductive medicine and men’s health specialists to improve semen analysis and infertility assessments without having to refer patients to outside clinical laboratories.
  
 MiOXSYS is currently marketed outside the U.S. as we advance MiOXSYS towards FDA clearance as an aid in the assessment of male infertility in the U.S. MiOXSYS is a CE marked system (that is also Health Canada, Australian TGA and Mexican COFEPRAS approved) and is an accurate, easy to use, and fast infertility assessment tool that directly measures oxidative stress in semen though the direct measurement of oxidation-reduction potential. It is estimated that 72.4 million couples worldwide experience infertility problems. In the U.S., approximately 10% of couples are defined as infertile. Male infertility is responsible for between 40 – 50% of all infertility cases and affects approximately 7% of all men. Male infertility is prevalent and underserved, and oxidative stress is widely implicated in its pathophysiology. The global male infertility market is expected to grow to over $4.7 billion by 2025 with a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of nearly 4.6% Oxidative stress is broadly implicated in the pathophysiology of idiopathic male infertility, yet very few diagnostic tools exist to effectively measure oxidative stress levels in men. However, antioxidants are widely available and recommended to infertile men without easy, accurate assessment methods available for initial evaluation and subsequent response to antioxidant intervention. With the introduction of the MiOXSYS System, there is an easy and effective diagnostic tool to assess the degree of oxidative stress and potentially enable the monitoring of patients’ responses to antioxidant therapy as a treatment regimen for male infertility. We expect to advance MiOXSYS into clinical trials in the U.S. in order to enable 510(k) de novo clearance in the coming twelve to eighteen months. 
 
 
 Our Strategy 
  
 Our management team has extensive experience across a wide range of business development activities and have in-licensed or acquired products from large, mid-sized, and small enterprises in the U.S. and abroad. Through an assertive product and business development approach, we expect that we will build a substantial portfolio of complementary commercial and near-commercial-stage products. Our strategy to create value for shareholders in the near-term is by implementing a focused, four-pronged strategy:
  
   ●
 Focus on sales growth of existing U.S. product portfolio. Our primary focus is on growing sales of Natesto in the U.S. and continuing to ramp-up the market launch of both Tuzistra XR and ZolpiMist through our sales force and strategic partners.

 
   ●
 Expand MiOXSYS Expand the MiOXSYS business outside the U.S. through continued market development, cultivation of key opinion leaders in large markets, and the advancement of clinical studies that further validate MiOXSYS’s clinical utility in male infertility.

 
   ●
 Advance MiOXSYS toward FDA Clearance. MiOXSYS is already CE Marked, Health Canada, Australian TGA and Mexico COFEPRIS approved. We are focused on completing ongoing clinical trials in order to obtain FDA clearance for sale and distribution in the U.S. If cleared in the U.S., MiOXSYS would be the first and only semen analysis diagnostic test cleared by the FDA for the detection of oxidative stress in infertility.

 
   ●
 Identify and license or acquire complimentary assets. We plan to augment our core in-development and commercial assets through efficient identification of complementary products. We intend to seek assets that are near commercial stage or already generating revenues. Further, we intend to seek to acquire products through mergers, asset purchases, licensing, co-development, or collaborative commercial arrangements (including co-promotions and co-marketing arrangements).

 Government Regulation
  
 While we do not have any pharmaceutical product candidates that we are actively developing as of the date of this Report, we may in the future acquire such products if such efforts are necessary to achieve our strategic goals. Currently, we are developing one medical device candidate for approval by the FDA, the MiOXSYS System, for which regulatory approval must be received before we can market this within the U.S.
 Approval Process for Pharmaceutical Products 
  
 In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, NDAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
 Approval Process for Medical Devices 
  
 In the U.S., the FDCA, FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. The FDA regulates the design, manufacturing, servicing, sale and distribution of medical devices, including molecular diagnostic test kits and instrumentation systems. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
  
  Regulation after FDA Clearance or Approval 
  
 Any devices we manufacture or distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. We are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cGMP requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which include, among other things, testing, control and documentation requirements. Noncompliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant 510k de novo clearance or PMA approval of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions, fines and imprisonment. Our contract manufacturers’ facilities operate under the FDA’s cGMP requirements.
  
  Foreign Regulatory Approval 
  
 Outside of the U.S., our ability to market our product candidates will be contingent also upon our receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities, whether or not FDA approval has been obtained. The foreign regulatory approval process in most industrialized countries generally encompasses risks similar to those we will encounter in the FDA approval process. The requirements governing conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorizations, and the time required to obtain requisite approvals, may vary widely from country to country and differ from those required for FDA approval.
Other Regulatory Matters 
  
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the U.S., the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. In the U.S., sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Health Care Reform Law, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.

  Drug Quality and Security Act
 
 In 2013, the United States Congress passed the Drug Quality and Security Act (“DQSA”), amending the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to grant the FDA more authority to regulate and monitor the manufacturing of compounding drugs. Title I of the DQSA increased regulation of compounding drugs. Title II of the DQSA Drug Supply Chain Security, established requirements to facilitate improved tracking of prescription drug products through the supply chain with increased product identification requirements. Currently, we are required to provide product identification information, or serialization, at the manufacturing batch, or lot level. However, going forward the law requires such tracking to done farther down the distribution chain including, (i) wholesalers authentification and verification in November 2019, (ii) pharmacy authentification and verification in the Fall of 2020, and at the unit level throughout the entire supply chain near the end of 2023.
 
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
  
  Reimbursement for our Products in the U.S. 
  
 Natesto, Tuzistra XR and ZolpiMist (our “US Approved Products”) are covered by many commercial insurance providers and pharmacy benefit management companies and are dependent upon reimbursement for continued use in the U.S. market. Additionally, privately managed Medicare Part D and other government plans may choose to cover our U.S. Approved Products prescribed through their plans’ pharmacy benefits.
  
 We do not anticipate that the sales of the MiOXSYS System, if approved for sale in the U.S., will be heavily dependent upon reimbursement by third-party payors in the U.S. given that infertility testing and treatment is infrequently covered by commercial insurers or public payors. Traditionally, sales of pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, ad devices that are not “lifestyle” indications depend, in part, on the extent to which products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services.
  
 Lack of third-party reimbursement for our product candidate or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of the product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
  
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and prices generally tend to be lower than in the U.S.
  
  DEA Regulation 
  
 Natesto, Tuzistra XR and ZolpiMist, already approved by the FDA, are each a “controlled substance” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, because Natesto contains testosterone, ZolpiMist contains zolpidem tartrate, and Tuzistra XR contains codeine. As a result, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agencies, or DEA, have Natesto and Tuzistra XR listed and regulated as Schedule III substances, while ZolpiMist is listed and regulated as a Schedule IV substance.
  
 Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. Similarly, separate registrations are also required for separate facilities.
  
 The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration and on a periodic basis. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special permits and notification requirements apply to imports and exports of narcotic drugs.
  
 The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much of a controlled substance may be produced in and/or imported into the U.S. based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our or our manufacturers’ quotas of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay, limitation or refusal by the DEA in establishing our or our manufacturers’ quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
  
 To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.

 Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products, including, for example, state requirements for licensures or registration.
  
 Intellectual Property 
  
  Natesto
  
 Aytu has an exclusive license from Acerus Pharmaceuticals Corporation (“Acerus”) for the U.S. rights to intellectual property related to a nasal gel drug product containing testosterone to treat hypogonadism in males, including the FDA approved product Natesto®, as well as an authorized generic version and OTC versions thereof. The license includes sublicense rights to intellectual property owned by Mattern Pharmaceuticals and exclusively licensed to Acerus by Mattern Pharmaceuticals. The sublicensed intellectual property includes four Orange Book listed patents directed at nasal gel formulations containing testosterone or methods of testosterone replacement therapy by nasal administration of the same. It further includes three patents that are not listed in the Orange Book directed at a testosterone formulation, a method of making a testosterone formulation and a method for reducing physical or chemical interactions between a nasal testosterone formulation and a plastic container.
  
 The Acerus license also grants rights to intellectual property owned by Acerus which includes nine nonprovisional patent applications, some of which may be abandoned. These patent applications include at least four pending applications directed to testosterone titration methods, intranasal testosterone bio-adhesive gel formulations, and controlled release testosterone formulations.
  
 On July 29, 2019, we agreed to amend and restate the License and Supply Agreement with Acerus. The effectiveness of the amended Agreement is conditioned upon Acerus obtaining new financing within six months of signing of the amended Agreement. Aytu will continue to serve as the exclusive U.S. supplier to purchasers of Natesto, and Acerus will receive performance-based commissions on prescriptions generated by urology and endocrinology specialties. Acerus will assume regulatory and clinical responsibilities and associated expenses and will serve a primary role in the development of key opinion leaders in urology and endocrinology. Aytu will focus on commercial channel management, sales to wholesalers and other purchasing customers, and will direct sales efforts in all other physician specialties.
  
  Tuzistra XR
  
 Aytu has an exclusive license to commercialize Tuzistra XR in the US and, through this relationship, Aytu is listed as the Tuzistra XR New Drug Application holder and holder of two Orange Book listed patents protecting Tuzistra XR. Both patents cover the extended release technology supporting Tuzistra XR’s long duration of antitussive effect, and the patents extend to March of 2029.
  
 MiOXSYS
  
 We have an extensive range of intellectual property for MiOXSYS. We have patent protection in the U.S. and several other large markets worldwide for MiOXSYS and the oxidation-reduction potential platform. Specifically, we have numerous patents issued and pending for the MiOXSYS system, the sensors, and their clinical and scientific use in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Israel, Japan, and China.
  
 Our patent portfolio related to MiOXSYS and the underlying oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) technology is focused on the U.S. and core foreign jurisdictions which include Europe, Canada, Israel, Japan and China. The portfolio is supported in the U.S. and core foreign jurisdictions and consists of 44 issued patents and 18 pending applications.
 
 The portfolio primarily consists of eight families filed in the U.S. and in core foreign jurisdictions. The first family includes thirteen issued patents with claims directed to the measurement of the ORP of a patient sample to evaluate various conditions. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family is in 2028. The second family includes two pending U.S. applications, three issued U.S. patents, one pending application in core foreign jurisdictions and four issued patents in core foreign jurisdictions with claims directed to the measurement of the ORP capacity of a patient sample to evaluate various conditions. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family is in 2033. The third family includes nineteen issued patents with claims directed to devices and methods for the measurement of ORP and ORP capacity. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family is in 2032. The fourth family includes two issued U.S. patents, two issued patents in core foreign jurisdictions and four pending applications in core foreign jurisdictions with claims directed to multiple layer gel test strip measurement devices and methods of making for use in measuring ORP and ORP capacity. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family is in 2033. The fifth family includes one pending U.S. application, one issued U.S. patent and seven pending applications in core foreign jurisdictions with claims directed to methods for determining fertility characteristics from the ORP of a biological sample. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family is in 2035. The sixth family includes one pending U.S. application with claims directed to methods for evaluating stroke patients from the ORP characteristics of a biological sample. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family is in 2036. The seventh family includes one pending application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty with claims directed to methods for embryo selection from the ORP characteristics of a biological sample. The standard 20-year expiration for patents in this family is in 2038. The eighth family includes one pending application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty with claims directed to methods of treating infertility in varicocele patients.

 We have also exclusively licensed the issued and pending patents protecting Natesto. There are four FDA Orange Book-listed patents surrounding methods of use of a nasally-administered testosterone gel and formulations thereof. The standard 20-year expiration for patents across these four patents is 2024.
 
 There are two FDA Orange Book-listed patents protecting Tuzistra XR. Through our exclusively commercialization agreement with TRIS Pharma, we are the FDA-recognized New Drug Application holder and thus the designated holder of these patents. The first patent describes a coated ion-exchange resin complex delivering an extended release formulation and methods therein. The standard 20-year exclusivity for this patent is in 2029. The second patent covers an aqueous liquid suspension containing a drug-ion exchange resin complex and methods therein. The standard 20-year exclusivity for this patent is in 2027.
 
 We also maintain trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect through confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information. If we do not adequately protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, our competitive position and business prospects could be materially harmed.
  
 We expect to seek U.S. and foreign patent protection for drug and device products we discover, as well as therapeutic and device products and processes. We expect also to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect certain other technologies which may be used to discover and characterize drugs and device products and processes, and which may be used to develop novel therapeutic and diagnostic products and processes.
  
 We will be able to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties primarily to the extent that such rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. If we must litigate to protect our intellectual property from infringement, we may incur substantial costs and our officers may be forced to devote significant time to litigation-related matters. The laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Our pending patent applications, or those we may file or license from third parties in the future, may not result in patents being issued. Until a patent is issued, the claims covered by an application for patent may be narrowed or removed entirely, thus depriving us of adequate protection. As a result, we may face unanticipated competition, or conclude that without patent rights the risk of bringing product candidates to market exceeds the returns we are likely to obtain. We are generally aware of the scientific research being conducted in the areas in which we focus our research and development efforts, but patent applications filed by others are maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months and, in some cases in the U.S., until the patent is issued. The publication of discoveries in scientific literature often occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made. As a result, it is possible that patent applications for products similar to our drug or diagnostic products and product candidates may have already been filed by others without our knowledge.
  
  U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
  
 Depending upon the timing, duration and other specific aspects of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if any of our NDA’s are approved, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond the current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Competition 
  
 The healthcare industry is highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change as researchers learn more about diseases and develop new technologies and treatments. Significant competitive factors in our industry include product efficacy and safety; quality and breadth of an organization’s technology; skill of an organization’s employees and its ability to recruit and retain key employees; timing and scope of regulatory approvals; government reimbursement rates for, and the average selling price of, products; the availability of raw materials and qualified manufacturing capacity; manufacturing costs; intellectual property and patent rights and their protection; and sales and marketing capabilities. Market acceptance of our current products and product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including: (i) potential advantages over existing or alternative therapies or tests, (ii) the actual or perceived safety of similar classes of products, (iii) the effectiveness of sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, and (iv) the scope of any approval provided by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities.

 We are a very small specialty pharmaceuticals company compared to other companies that we are competing against. Our current and potential competitors include large pharmaceutical, biotechnology, diagnostic, and medical device companies, as well as specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies. Many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly more experience in the marketing, commercialization, discovery, development and regulatory approvals of products, which could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage or deny us marketing exclusivity rights. Specifically, our competitors will most likely have larger sales teams and have more capital resources to support their products then we do.
  
 Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in achieving widespread market acceptance and obtaining FDA approval for product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market, as advanced technologies become available and as generic forms of currently branded products become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our products non-competitive or obsolete.
  
 We cannot assure you that any of our products that we acquire or successfully develop will be clinically superior or scientifically preferable to products developed or introduced by our competitors.
  
 Our current approved products compete in highly competitive fields whereby there are numerous options available to clinicians including generics. These generic treatment options are frequently less expensive and more widely available.
  
  Natesto
  
 The U.S. prescription testosterone market is comprised primarily of topically applied treatments in the form of gels, solutions, and patches. Testopel®, an injectable pellet typically implanted directly under the skin by a physician, is also FDA-approved. AndroGel is the market-leading TRT and is marketed by AbbVie.
  
 Tuzistra XR
  
 Tuzistra XR competes in the approximately $3.0 billion antitussive category and has a distinct advantage over the existing codeine-based antitussives. Tuzistra XR is the only liquid codeine antitussive with a 12-hour duration of effective, which provides more dosing convenience than the current 4-6 hour codeine cough syrups. 
      
  ZolpiMist
  
 ZolpiMist competes in a large prescription category with over 43 million prescriptions written annually and generating $1.8 billion in wholesale sales. The non-benzodiazepine prescription sleep aid market is dominated by zolpidem tartrate (brand name Ambien), which accounts for approximately 30 million prescriptions annually. Various forms of zolpidem tartrate are commercially available, including both immediate release and controlled release tablets as well as orally dissolving tablets. ZolpiMist is the only oral spray formulation of zolpidem tartrate and, if only achieving 1% of the ‘zolpidem market’ this product could generate 300,000 prescriptions annually in the U.S. No zolpidem tartrate products are actively marketed in the U.S., so we believe our sales force will have the ability to effectively influence physician prescribing and grow ZolpiMist prescriptions.
  
  MiOXSYS 
  
 With respect to MiOXSYS competitive offerings, there are other oxidative stress diagnostic tests available throughout the world, although none are approved in the U.S. for clinical use, and none are used specifically in semen analysis. ‘General use’ oxidative stress diagnostic systems that are marketed for clinical use outside the U.S. include the FRAS 4 system (H&D srl), FREE Carpe Diem (Diacron International), and the FORM and FORMPlus systems (Callegari srl). These systems are used in both research and clinical settings but do not generate significant sales in the clinical setting and, again, are not used specifically in semen analysis for infertility testing. These potentially competitive oxidative stress systems’ testing parameters differ significantly from MiOXSYS and would need to demonstrate clinical superiority to MiOXSYS in order to substantially detract from MiOXSYS prescribing and sales. Additionally, to our knowledge, these systems have not demonstrated clinical feasibility in human semen or seminal plasma. These tests are used for research use, but they do not measure oxidation-reduction potential and, we believe, are not directly competitive to the MiOXSYS System in the context of research use.
  
 Research and Development 
  
 The research and development required for FDA approval of Natesto, ZolpiMist, and Tuzistra XR has been conducted by either previous owners of the products or the companies from which we licensed or acquired these products. To the extent we seek to further develop our products and/or improve clinical claims. we rely upon outside collaborators to conduct research as we focus primarily on commercialization.

 Currently, there is an ongoing investigator-initiated study for Natesto. We are financially supporting the study being conducted at the University of Miami, through which the investigators seek to demonstrate that Natesto improves hypogonadism while preserving fertility. The study has been designed and is led by Dr. Ranjith Ramasamy, MD, Director of Reproductive Urology at the University of Miami’s Department of Urology. The study is expected to be completed in 2019. If found to preserve fertility, Natesto would be the first TRT to demonstrate this and, we expect, these results would further support the clinical differentiation of Natesto in the TRT category.
 
 Our MiOXSYS System has been developed in conjunction with numerous medical device and diagnostic development consultants. Further, we have relationships with regulatory consultants who are actively assisting in the development of our regulatory strategy with the FDA as MiOXSYS advances to this stage. To complement our internal clinical research efforts with the MiOXSYS System, we have engaged with numerous academic and private researchers around the world to identify and develop research and clinical applications for the MiOXSYS System.
  
 Manufacturing 
  
 Our business strategy is to use cGMP compliant contract manufacturers for the manufacture of clinical supplies as well as for commercial supplies if required by our commercialization plans, and to transfer manufacturing responsibility to our collaboration partners when possible.
 Natesto
  
 On April 22, 2016, we entered into a license and supply agreement with Acerus pursuant to which we will pay Acerus a supply price per unit of the greater of (i) a fixed percentage of Acerus’ cost of goods sold for Natesto, not to exceed a fixed ceiling price and (ii) a moderate double digit percentage of net sales for the first year of the agreement, that increased in each of the second and third years and remains constant after that.
  
  
   Tuzistra XR
  On November 5, 2018 we entered into a licensing, manufacturing and supply agreement with TRIS, pursuant to which TRIS has the exclusive rights to manufacture, label, package and supply us Tuzistra XR on an exclusive basis in the U.S. We expect to continue to source Tuzistra XR under this arrangement for the term of the agreement with TRIS.
 
  ZolpiMist
  
 On June 11, 2018 we entered into a licensing agreement with Magna, pursuant to which we assumed a manufacturing agreement with a cGMP compliant contract manufacturer. We expect to continue manufacturing through that third-party and have made an initial and subsequent purchase of product that we expect to supply us for the foreseeable future.
 
  MiOXSYS
  
 We secured supply and quality agreements with manufacturers for both the MiOXSYS instrument as well as MiOXSYS sensor strips. Both manufacturers hold long-standing ISO 13485:2003 certifications and are established medical device manufacturers. Both manufacturers have high volume manufacturing capacity such that production volumes can be easily scaled. Both manufacturers have been audited by our quality engineers and are fully compliant.
 
 Employees 
  
 As of August 31, 2019, we had 53 full-time employees and utilized the services of a number of consultants on a temporary basis. Overall, we have not experienced any work stoppage and do not anticipate any work stoppage in the foreseeable future. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes that relations with our employees are good.
