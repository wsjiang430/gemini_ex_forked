Item 1. Business.
General
The "Company," "Winnebago Industries," "we," "our," and "us" are used interchangeably to refer to Winnebago Industries, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as appropriate in the context. 
Winnebago Industries, Inc. is a leading U.S. manufacturer with a diversified portfolio of recreation vehicles ("RV"s) and marine products used primarily in leisure travel and outdoor recreation activities. We produce our Towable units in IN; our Motorhome units in manufacturing facilities in IA; and our marine products in FL. We distribute our RV and marine products primarily through independent dealers throughout the U.S. and Canada, who then retail the products to the end consumer. We also distribute our marine products internationally through independent dealers, who then retail the products to the end consumer.
We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Iowa on February 12, 1958, and adopted our present name on February 28, 1961.
Available Information 
Our website, located at www.wgo.net, provides additional information about us. On our website, you can obtain, free of charge, this and prior year Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all of our other filings with the SEC. Our recent press releases are also available on our website. Our website also contains important information regarding our corporate governance practices. Information contained on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Principal Products
We have five operating segments: 1) Grand Design towables, 2) Winnebago towables, 3) Winnebago motorhomes, 4) Chris-Craft marine, and 5) Winnebago specialty vehicles. We evaluate performance based on each operating segment's Adjusted EBITDA, as defined within Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which excludes certain corporate administration expenses and non-operating income and expense.
Our two reportable segments include: 1) Towable (comprised of products which are not motorized and are generally towed by another vehicle as well as other related manufactured products and services), which is an aggregation of the Winnebago towables and Grand Design towables operating segments, and 2) Motorhome (comprised of products that include a motorized chassis as well as other related manufactured products and services). 
The Corporate / All Other category includes the Chris-Craft marine and Winnebago specialty vehicles operating segments as well as expenses related to certain corporate administration expenses for the oversight of the enterprise. These expenses include items such as corporate leadership and administration costs.
Towable
A towable is a non-motorized vehicle that is designed to be towed by automobiles, pickup trucks, SUVs, or vans and is used as temporary living quarters for recreational travel. The Recreation Vehicle Industry Association ("RVIA") classifies towables in four types: conventional travel trailers, fifth wheels, folding camper trailers, and truck campers. We manufacture and sell conventional travel trailers and fifth wheels under the Winnebago and Grand Design brand names, which are defined as follows:
Type | Description | Winnebago product offerings | Grand Design product offerings 
Travel trailer | Towed by means of a hitch attached to the frame of the vehicle | Minnie Plus, Minnie, Micro Minnie, Minnie Drop, and Spyder | Transcend, Imagine, and Reflection
Fifth wheel | Constructed with a raised forward section that is connected to the vehicle with a special fifth wheel hitch | Minnie Plus and Micro Minnie | Momentum, Reflection, and Solitude

Our travel trailer and fifth wheel towables are sold by dealers in the retail market with manufacturer's suggested retail prices ranging from approximately $20,000 to $110,000, depending on size and model, plus optional equipment and delivery charges.

Unit sales of our towables for the last three fiscal years were as follows:

 | 2019 | 2018 | | 2017
Travel trailer | 22,458 | | 61.0 | % | 22,360 | 61.1 | % | 13,650 | 60.7 | %
Fifth wheel | 14,371 | | 39.0 | % | 14,229 | 38.9 | % | 8,824 | 39.3 | %
Total towables | 36,829 | | 100.0 | % | 36,589 | 100.0 | % | 22,474 | 100.0 | %

Motorhome
A motorhome is a self-propelled mobile dwelling used primarily as temporary living quarters during vacation and camping trips, or to support active and mobile lifestyles. The RVIA classifies motorhomes into three types, all of which we manufacture and sell under the Winnebago brand name, which are defined as follows: 
Type | Description | Winnebago products offerings 
Class A | Built on a heavy truck chassis in both diesel and gas models with the ability to tow a small vehicle | Gas: Adventurer, Intent, Vista, and Sunstar 
Diesel: Horizon and Forza
Class B | Built by adding taller roof and amenities to existing van, which allows for easy maneuvering | Boldt, Revel, Travato, and Era 
Class C | Built on a medium truck chassis in both diesel and gas models with similar features and amenities to Class A models | View, Navion, Vita, Porto, Minnie Winnie, Spirit, Outlook, and Fuse

Our Class A, B, and C motorhomes are sold by dealers in the retail market with manufacturer's suggested retail prices ranging from approximately $80,000 to $500,000, depending on size and model, plus optional equipment and delivery charges. Our motorhomes range in length from 21 to 44 feet.
Unit sales of our motorhomes for the last three fiscal years were as follows:
 | 2019 | 2018 | | 2017
Class A | 1,582 | | 20.8 | % | 2,997 | 31.4 | % | 3,182 | 34.4 | %
Class B | 2,784 | | 36.7 | % | 2,012 | 21.1 | % | 1,541 | 16.6 | %
Class C | 3,225 | | 42.5 | % | 4,539 | 47.5 | % | 4,537 | 49.0 | %
Total motorhomes | 7,591 | | 100.0 | % | 9,548 | 100.0 | % | 9,260 | 100.0 | %

Motorhome parts and service activities represent revenues generated by service work we perform for retail customers at our Forest City, IA facilities as well as revenues from the sale of unit parts. Our competitive strategy is to provide proprietary manufactured parts through our dealer network, which we believe increases customer satisfaction and the value of our motorhomes.
Chris-Craft
On June 4, 2018, we acquired 100% of the ownership interests of Chris-Craft USA, Inc. ("Chris-Craft"), a privately-owned company based in Sarasota, Florida. As a result of this acquisition, we manufacture and sell premium quality boats in the recreational powerboat industry through an established global network of independent authorized dealers.
Winnebago Specialty Vehicles
We also manufacture other specialty commercial vehicles primarily custom designed for the buyer's specific needs and requirements, such as law enforcement command centers, mobile medical clinics, and mobile office space. These specialty commercial vehicles are manufactured in Forest City, Iowa and sold through our dealer network. In addition, we also provide commercial vehicles as bare shells to third-party upfitters for conversion at their facilities. 
Production
We generally produce towables and motorhomes to stock for dealers. We have some ability to increase our capacity by scheduling overtime and/or hiring additional production employees or to decrease our capacity through the use of shortened work weeks and/or reducing head count. We have long been known as an industry leader in innovation as each year we introduce new or redesigned products. These changes generally include new floor plans and sizes as well as design and decor modifications. Most of our raw materials such as steel, aluminum, fiberglass, and wood products are obtainable from numerous sources.
Our towables are produced at two assembly campuses located in Middlebury, IN. The majority of components are comprised of frames, appliances, and furniture, and are purchased from suppliers. In Fiscal 2019, we had one supplier that accounted for more than 10% of our Towable raw material purchases.

Our motorhomes are produced in the state of IA at four different campuses. Our motorhome business utilizes vertically integrated supply streams, with the principal exceptions being chassis, engines, generators, and appliances that we purchase from reputable manufacturers. Certain parts, especially motorhome chassis, are available from a small group of suppliers. In Fiscal 2019, we had three suppliers that each individually accounted for more than 10% of our Motorhome raw material purchases. 
Backlog
We strive to balance timely order fulfillment to our dealers with the lead times suppliers require to efficiently source materials and manage costs. Production facility constraints at peak periods also lead to fluctuations in backlog orders which we manage closely. The approximate revenue of our Towable backlog was $234.3 million and $244.9 million as of August 31, 2019 and August 25, 2018, respectively. The approximate revenue of our Motorhome backlog was $165.4 million and $157.6 million as of August 31, 2019 and August 25, 2018, respectively. A more detailed description of our Motorhome and Towable order backlog is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Distribution and Financing
We market our products on a wholesale basis to a diversified independent dealer network located throughout the U.S. and, to a limited extent, in Canada, Africa, Asia, Europe, Australia, and South America. Foreign sales were 10% or less of Net revenues during each of the past three fiscal years.
As of August 31, 2019, our RV and marine dealer network in the U.S. and Canada included approximately 600 physical dealer locations, many of which carry more than one of our brands. None of our dealer organizations accounted for more than 10% of our Net revenues for Fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017.
We have sales and service agreements with dealers which are subject to annual review. Many of the dealers are also engaged in other areas of business, including the sale of automobiles, trailers, or boats, and most dealers carry one or more competitive lines of RVs. We continue to place high emphasis on the capability of our dealers to provide complete service for our products. Dealers are obligated to provide full service for owners of our products or, in lieu thereof, to secure such service from other authorized providers.
We advertise and promote our products through national trade magazines, the distribution of product brochures, the Go RVing national advertising campaign sponsored by RVIA, our websites, social media, direct-mail advertising campaigns, various national promotional opportunities, and on a local basis through trade shows, television, radio, and newspapers, primarily in connection with area dealers.
Sales to dealers are made on cash terms. Most dealers are financed on a "floorplan" basis under which a bank or finance company lends the dealer all, or substantially all, of the purchase price, collateralized by a security interest in the merchandise purchased. As is customary in our industries, we typically enter into a repurchase agreement with a lending institution financing a dealer's purchase of our product upon the lending institution's request and after completion of a credit check of the dealer involved. Our repurchase agreements provide that, for up to 18 months after an RV unit is financed and up to 24 months after a marine unit is financed, in the event of default by the dealer on the agreement to pay the lending institution and repossession of the unit(s) by the lending institution, we will repurchase the financed merchandise from the lender at the amount then due, which is often less than dealer invoice. Our maximum exposure for repurchases varies significantly from time to time, depending upon the level of dealer inventory, general economic conditions, demand for our products, dealer location, and access to and the cost of financing. See Note 11, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
The RV and marine markets are highly competitive with many other manufacturers selling products which compete directly with our products. Some of our competitors are much larger than us, most notably in the towable RV market, which may provide these competitors additional purchasing power. The competition in our industry is based upon design, price, quality, features, and service of the products. We believe our principal competitive advantages are our brand strength, product quality, and our service after the sale. We also believe that our products have historically commanded a price premium as a result of these competitive advantages. 
Seasonality
The primary use of RVs and marine products for leisure travel and outdoor recreation has historically led to a peak retail selling season concentrated in the spring and summer months and lower sales during winter months. Our sales are generally influenced by this pattern in retail sales, but sales can also be affected by the level of dealer inventory. As a result, our RV sales are historically lowest during our second fiscal quarter, which ends in February.

Governmental Regulations
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and, to a limited extent, international laws and regulations, including the federal Motor Vehicle Act ("MVA"), under which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") may require manufacturers to recall RVs that contain safety-related defects, and numerous state consumer protection laws and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles, including so-called "Lemon Laws." The Boat Safety Act of 1971 has similar safety-related recall requirements for marine units. In addition, marine units sold in the U.S. and Europe must meet the certification standards of the U.S. Coast Guard and the European Community, respectively. 
We are also subject to regulations established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"). Our facilities are periodically inspected by federal and state agencies, such as OSHA. We are a member of RVIA, a voluntary association of RV manufacturers which promulgates RV safety standards. We place an RVIA seal on each of our RVs to certify that the RVIA standards have been met. We believe that our products and facilities comply in all material respects with the applicable vehicle safety, consumer protection, RVIA, and OSHA regulations and standards.
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal and state environmental laws and regulations relating to the use, generation, storage, treatment, emission, labeling, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and noise pollution. We believe that we are currently in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations in all material aspects.

We believe that our trademarks and trade names are significant assets to our business, and we have in the past and will in the future vigorously protect them against infringement by third parties. We are not dependent upon any patents or technology licenses of others for the conduct of our business.    
Human Resources
At the end of Fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, we employed approximately 4,500, 4,700, and 4,060 persons, respectively. None of our employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
