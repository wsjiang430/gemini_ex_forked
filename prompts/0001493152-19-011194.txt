OUR MINERAL PROPERTIES AND PROJECTS
 
Copper King Project
 
The Copper King Project (the “Copper King Project”) consists of certain mining leases and other mineral rights comprising the Copper King gold and copper exploration project located in the Silver Crown Mining District of southeast Wyoming.
Location and Access
 
The Copper King Project is located in southeastern Wyoming, approximately 32km west of the city of Cheyenne, on the southeastern margin of the Laramie Range. The property covers about five square kilometers that include the S½ Section 25, NE¼ Section 35, and all of Section 36, T.14N., R.70W., Sixth Principal Meridian. Access to within 1.5km of the property is provided by paved and maintained gravel roads. An easement agreement providing access for exploration and other minimal impact activities has been negotiated with Ferguson Ranch Inc. on the S½ Section 25, T14N, R70W, and the W½ Section 30, T14N, R69W. The fee for this easement is $10,000 per year, renewable each year prior to July 11.
 
The Copper King property covers 453 contiguous hectares (approximately five square kilometers) that include the S½ of Section 25, NE¼ Section 35, and all of Section 36, T.14N., R.70W. The project is entirely located on land owned and administered by the State of Wyoming. There are no federal lands within or adjoining the Copper King land position. Curt Gowdy State Park lies northwest of the property, partially within Section 26. The state park’s southeastern boundary is approximately 300m northwest of the property and approximately 900m northwest of the mineralized area. The Copper King property position consists of two State of Wyoming Metallic and Non-metallic Rocks and Minerals Mining Leases.

Rights to the Copper King Project
 
Our rights to the Copper King Project arise under two State of Wyoming mineral leases:
 
1) State of Wyoming Mining Lease No. 0-40828
 
Township 14 North, Range 70 West, 6th P.M., Laramie County, Wyoming:
 
Section 36: All
 
2) State of Wyoming Mining Lease No. 0-40858
 
Township 14 North, Range 70 West, 6th P.M., Laramie County, Wyoming:
 
Section 25: S/2
 Section 35: NE/4
 
Ownership of the mineral rights remains in the possession of the State of Wyoming as conveyed to the State by the United States, evidenced by 1942 patents for Section 36, and 1989 Order confirming title to Section 25 and 35. The State of Wyoming issued Mineral Leases for the mineral rights to Wyoming Gold Mining Company, Inc. (“Wyoming Gold”) in 2013 and 2014. These leases were assigned to us on June 23, 2014.
 
Lease 0-40828 was renewed in February 2013 for a second ten-year term and Lease 0-40858 was renewed for its second ten-year term in February 2014. Each lease requires an annual payment of $2.00 per acre.
 
The following production royalties must be paid to the State of Wyoming, although once the project is in operation, the Board of Land Commissioners has the authority to reduce the royalty payable to the State:
 

FOB Mine Value per Ton | Percentage Royalty | 
-----------------------+--------------------+---
$00.00 to $50.00 | | 5 | %
$50.01 to $100.00 | | 7 | %
$100.01 to $150.00 | | 9 | %
$150.01 and up | | 10 | %

History of Prior Operations and Exploration on the Copper King Project
 
Limited exploration and mining were conducted on the Copper King property in the late 1880s and early 1900s. Approximately 300 tons of material was reported to have been produced from a now inaccessible 160-foot-deep shaft with two levels of cross-cuts. A few small adits and prospect pits with no significant production are scattered throughout the property.
 
Since 1938, at least nine historic (pre-Strathmore Minerals Corp.) drilling campaigns by at least seven companies plus the U.S. Bureau of Mines have been conducted at Copper King. The current project database contains 91 drill holes totaling 37,500 feet that were drilled before Wyoming Gold acquired the property. All but six of the drill holes are within the current resource area. Other work conducted at Copper King by previous companies has included ground and aeromagnetic surveys as well as induced polarization surveys along with geochemical sampling, geologic mapping, and a number of metallurgical studies.
 
Wyoming Gold conducted an exploration drill program in 2007 and 2008. Thirty-five diamond core drill holes were completed for a total of 25,500 feet. The exploration permit, 360DN, has been terminated and the bond released. The focus of that work was to confirm and potentially expand the mineralized body outlined in the previous drill campaigns, increase the geologic and geochemical database leading to the creation of the current geologic model and mineralization estimate, and to provide material for further metallurgical testing. The Copper King historic assay database for some 120 holes contains 8,357 gold assays and 8,225 copper assays. At least 10 different organizations or individuals conducted metallurgical studies on the gold-copper mineralization at the request of prior operators between 1973 and 2009. It was concluded that the process with the highest potential to yield good extractions of gold and copper would likely be flotation, followed by cyanidation of the flotation tailings. Core is stored in two public storage facilities; one is AAA in Cheyenne, Wyoming and the other is Absaroka in Dubois, Wyoming.

Geological Summary of the Copper King Project
 
The Copper King Project is underlain by Proterozoic rocks that make up the southern end of the Precambrian core of the Laramie Range. Metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of amphibolite-grade metamorphism are intruded by the 1.4-billion-year-old Sherman Granite and related felsic rocks. Within the project area, foliated granodiorite is intruded by aplitic quartz monzonite dikes, thin mafic dikes and younger pegmatite dikes. Shear zones with cataclastic foliation striking N60°E to N60°W are found in the southern part of the Silver Crown district, including at Copper King. The granodiorite typically shows potassium enrichment, particularly near contacts with quartz monzonite. Copper and gold mineralization occurs primarily in unfoliated to mylonitic granodiorite. The mineralization is associated with a N60°W-trending shear zone and disseminated and stockwork gold-copper deposits in the intrusive rocks. Some authors have categorized it as a Proterozoic porphyry gold-copper deposit. Hydrothermal alteration is overprinted on retrograde greenschist alteration and includes a central zone of silicification, followed outward by a narrow potassic zone, surrounded by propylitic alteration. Higher-grade mineralization occurs within a central core of thin quartz veining and stockwork mineralization that is surrounded by a zone of lower-grade disseminated mineralization. Disseminated sulfides and native copper with stockwork malachite and chrysocolla are present at the surface, and chalcopyrite, pyrite, minor bornite, primary chalcocite, pyrrhotite, and native copper are present at depth. Gold occurs as free gold.
 
The Copper King exploration property contains oxide, mixed oxide-sulfide, and sulfide rock types. At the stated cutoff grade 0.015oz AuEq/ton, approximately 80% of the resource is sulfide material with the remaining 20% split evenly between the oxide and mixed rock types. There is consistent distribution of gold and copper, albeit generally low-grade, throughout this potential open-pit type deposit.
 
U.S Gold Corp. Copper King Exploration Activities
 
In 2017, we performed two geophysical surveys at Copper King. A district-wide ground magnetic survey was completed in June 2017 and an induced polarization study was completed in October 2017. In addition, a complete compilation of the historic drilling database was done. The compilation was critical to verifying the northwest extension target. After the detailed geophysical studies were completed and interpreted, we developed exploration drill targets. The exploration drill program was completed in the Fall of 2017.
Preliminary Economic Assessment – Copper King Property, WY
 
A Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) for the historic Copper King deposit was updated by Mine Development Associates (MDA) and reported January 11, 2018. This PEA was prepared in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM”) – CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended (the “CIM Definition Standards”), which differ from SEC Industry Guide 7. This PEA is preliminary in nature and should not be considered to be a pre-feasibility or feasibility study, as the economic and technical viability of the Copper King Project have not been demonstrated at this time. Therefore, there can be no certainty that the estimates contained in the PEA will be realized. None of our properties contain any proven and probable reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7, and all of our activities on all of our properties are exploratory in nature.
2017 Drill Results – Copper King Property, WY
 
On January 30, 2018, we announced the results of our 2017 exploration drill program at Copper King. Hole CK17-01rc was a western step out hole from the historic deposit. The hole encountered mineralization of gold, copper, silver and zinc. Permitting and bonding for drilling at Copper King through a “Notification of Intent to Explore for Noncoal Minerals” was approved by the State of Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality based in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Assay results and interval thicknesses obtained in CK17-01rc were similar in value and character to assay intervals encountered in the Copper King deposit “main zone.” Assay results and characteristics of mineralization in this hole indicated the presence of a heretofore previously undiscovered zone of significant mineralization on the Copper King project.

2018 Drill Results – Copper King Property, WY
 
In October 2018, we announced the results of our 2018 eight-hole reverse circulation exploration drill program at Copper King. The eight holes indicated that the Copper King mineralization extended to the west, at least 200 meters, and maintains the historically measured and reported widths and depth to the deposit.
Drill Hole Analysis at Copper King Property, WY
 
On February 21, 2019, we announced that Datamine of Denver, CO, completed a comprehensive drill hole analysis of our Copper King gold-copper-silver-zinc deposit. Datamine included all of the historic drilling database and the step-out drill programs conducted by us in 2017 and 2018.
 
The Datamine study was designed to:
 

● | Organize the entire drill hole database for three-dimensional modeling purposes to include all the potential economic metals, not just gold and copper as previously modeled; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Provide detailed statistical analyses for informative and strategic interpretations; 
● | Provide wireframe, closed, shapes and grade shells for the deposit; and 
● | Provide indications, if any, for locations of additional discovery. 

 
The Datamine updated exploration model that indicates that the deposit potentially remains open to the southwest and also to the southeast and appears to have a curved configuration as opposed to a more confined, previous west-northwestward tabular configuration. The Datamine exploration model also illustrates various isoshells for gold, copper, silver and zinc. Certain Datamine visuals can be viewed at https://www.usgoldcorp.gold/properties/copper-king/datamine.
 
We plan to use this new digital exploration model to assist with a future potential exploration drilling program that we believe could provide an opportunity to discover additional prospective ore extensions. We also plan to further explore for and characterize the high-grade target zones of mineralization within the deposit. We are currently reviewing the conclusions from the Datamine exploration model and intend to develop additional exploration programs in the second half of 2019 based upon the results. We are also re-examining all existing regional exploration data for the purpose of identifying additional new target opportunities in the vicinity of Copper King.
 
For 2019, the majority of our efforts are planned to be focused on advancing the Copper King project further towards an eventual production decision. Multiple outside contractors are being consulted with for additional metallurgical, environmental, baseline and hydrological studies.
 
Copper King Quality Control Procedures
 
The Copper King PEA outlines the drilling procedures; sample preparation, analysis and security; and data verification for historic drilling at Copper King. MDA concludes that “data verification procedures support the geological interpretations and confirm the database quality. Therefore, the Copper King database is adequate for estimating a potential mineral resource.” We continue to apply industry standard practices for drilling and sampling at Copper King.
 
Specifically, drilling carried out in 2017 and 2018 by AK Drilling of Butte, Montana using a reverse circulation drill rig followed industry standards. RC cuttings were run through a rotary splitter on the drill as drilling advanced, which is industry standard, and a representative sample collected from the discharge point of the splitter. Chip samples were bagged and labeled by the drillers and then shipped to Bureau Veritas Mineral Laboratories in Sparks, NV for analysis. BV Labs crushed, split and pulverized 250g of rock to 200 mesh and fire assayed the samples. Assay certificates were received, analyzed, summarized and reported by our geologic team. As standard practice, certified blanks and standards were inserted into the sample stream at the lab on regular intervals, by us and BV. As assay results were received the analyzed assay values for given blanks or standards were visually compared to the expected assay values, and if they fell within the expected range of deviation as provided by the blank-standard provider, they were considered “passed” and the assay results can be relied upon. If the analyzed results did not fall within the expected range of deviation, the blank or standard was considered “failed” and BV was asked to re-run the blank or standard for gold fire-assay, along with the preceding two drill hole samples and the two proceeding the failed blank or standard. When re-run assay results were received, they were compared with the original results and deemed acceptable or not. All results to date have met our acceptability using the above-mentioned protocols.

Keystone Project, Cortez Trend, Nevada
 
Location
 
The Keystone Project consists of 650 unpatented lode mining claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada. The claims making up the Keystone Project are situated in Eureka County, Nevada in Sections 2-4 and 9-11, Township 23 North, Range 48 East, and Sections 22-28, and 33-36 Township 24 North, all Range 48 East of the Mount Diablo Meridian.

The Keystone Project is accessible via dirt roads. Navigation through the interior of the project is by off-road vehicle.
 
Title and Ownership for Keystone Project
 
The Keystone Project consists of unpatented mining claims located on federal land administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”). An annual maintenance fee of $165.00 per claim per year must be paid to the Nevada BLM by September 1 of each year, and failure to make the payment on time renders the claims void.
 
In addition, the State of Nevada requires the claimant to file an Affidavit and Notice of Intent to Hold in the appropriate county by November 1 of each year. However, the failure to timely record an Affidavit does not affect a forfeiture of the claims, as does the failure to pay the federal claim maintenance fees by September 1. Instead, in the event of a conflict with a junior locator, the senior claimant must prove his intent to maintain the claims. This can generally be accomplished by producing a receipt showing payment of the federal claim maintenance fees to the BLM.
 
The federal claim maintenance fees are prospective and are paid for the ensuing assessment year. For example, the payments made on June 29, 2015 relate to the 2015-2016 assessment year running from September 1, 2015 to September 1, 2016. By comparison, the Nevada filings are retrospective, describing the assessment year just ended or about to end.
 
Congress has extended the claim maintenance requirements through 2016. It will therefore be necessary for us to perform the following acts in order to maintain the claims in 2016-2017 and each year thereafter: (1) on or before September 1 of each year, we must pay a maintenance fee of $165.00 per claim to the Nevada BLM, and (2) on or before November 1 of each year we must record an Affidavit and Notice of Intent to Hold in Eureka County.
 
We acquired the mining claims comprising the Keystone Project on May 27, 2016 from Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC and Americas Gold Exploration, Inc. (“Americas Gold”) under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Some of the Keystone claims are subject to pre-existing net smelter royalty (“NSR”) obligations. In addition, under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC retained additional NSR rights of 0.5% with regard to certain claims and 3.5% with regard to certain other claims. The unpatented mining claims comprising the Keystone Project, with applicable NSR obligations, are as follows:
 

1. | Acquired 100% from Americas Gold; subject to a one percent (1%) NSR held by Wolfpack Gold Nevada Corp.; a two percent (2.0%) NSR with respect to precious metals and one percent (1.0%) NSR with respect to all other metals and minerals held by Orion Royalty Company, LLC; and a one-half percent (0.5%) NSR to Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC.

Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we may buy down 1% of the NSR owed to Nevada Gold Ventures LLC at any time through the fifth anniversary of the closing date for $2,000,000. In addition, we may buy down an additional 1% of the NSR owed to Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC anytime through the eighth anniversary of the closing date for $5,000,000.
 
History of Prior Operations and Exploration on the Keystone Project
 
No comprehensive, modern-era, model-driven exploration has ever been conducted on the Keystone Project. Newmont drilled 6 holes in the old base metal and silver Keystone mine area in 1967 and encountered low grade (+/- 0.02 opt) gold intercepts. Chevron staked the property in 1981-1983 and drilled 27 shallow drill holes, continued by an agreement with USMX that drilled an additional 19 shallow holes; significant amounts of low grade and anomalous gold were intersected, but results were considered uneconomic, and the project dropped. In 1988 and 1989, Phelps Dodge acquired a southern portion of the district and drilled 6 holes, one of which total depth in gold mineralization, and was subsequently deepened in 1990 resulting in over 200’ of low-grade gold mineralization. About this time Coral Resources acquired a northern portion of the property and drilled 21 shallow holes to follow-up previous drill intercepts. 1995-1997, Golden Glacier, a junior company, acquired the north end of the district, and Uranerz a portion of the southern area; 6 holes were drilled in the north and only 2 holes in the south, respectively. The entire district was dropped by all parties.
 
In 2004 with the discovery of Cortez Hills and escalating gold prices, Nevada Pacific Gold, Great American Minerals (Don McDowell), and Tone Resources (Dave Mathewson) competed in claim staking the entire district. Subsequently, Don McDowell, founder of Great American Minerals approached Placer Dome (prior to Barrick acquisition) who discovered Pipeline and Cortez Hills, and who correctly recognized the Keystone district potential. Placer Dome entered into separate joint venture agreements with Nevada Pacific and Great American. The following year Barrick Gold bought Placer Dome and dropped all Placer Dome’s Nevada exploration projects and joint ventures, including Keystone. In 2006, Nevada Pacific and Tone were purchased by McEwen Mining. McEwen Mining, drilled 35 holes mostly near the north end of the district; targeting the range front pediment and the historic Keystone Mine.
 
Geological Potential of the Keystone Project
 
To date, a technical report has not been prepared on the Keystone Project. Keystone is positioned on the prolific Cortez gold trend, one of the world’s leading gold producing regions. The Keystone Project is centered on a granitic intrusion that warped the local Paleozoic stratigraphy into a dome, allowing for exposure of highly favorable Devonian, Carboniferous (Mississippian-Pennsylvania) and Permo-Triassic rocks including key likely host rocks for mineralization, the silty carbonate strata of the Horse Creek Formation and the Wenban limestone, as well as possible sandy clastic units of the Diamond Peak Formation. The Horse Canyon and Wenban rocks are the primary host rocks at the nearby Cortez Hills Mine and Gold Rush deposit currently operated by Barrick Gold.
 
Keystone Exploration Activities for the twelve months ended April 30, 2019
 
We engage in exploration activities throughout each fiscal period to advance its mineral properties.

Keystone Plan of Operations (POO) Approval and Fall 2018 Drill program
 
On September 7, 2018 the U.S. Federal Government’s Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approved the previously filed Environmental Assessment (EA) and Plan of Operations (POO) for our Keystone Project on Nevada’s Cortez Gold Trend. The POO was subject to additional oversight and approval from the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (NDEP), which was received at the end of October 2018. Exploration related disturbance and reclamation bonding is possible in multiple phases of up to 50 acres each up to a total of 200 acres. On October 10, 2018, we received a letter from the BLM giving notice to proceed with its previously filed 2018 exploration plan. In September 2018, we advanced an additional reclamation bond payment of $319,553 for the first 50-acre disturbance. Total reclamation bond balance on the Keystone project total $346,947. After receiving all final permits and sign offs for road work, drill pad and surface disturbance, in November 2018, we commenced its Autumn 2018 drilling program at Keystone.
 
Master of Science Thesis – Keystone Property, NV
 
Gabriel E. Aliaga (“Gabriel”) is a Geology major at the University of Nevada, Reno, studying under Dr. Michael W. Ressel. Over the past two years, Gabriel worked on the Keystone project under a sponsorship by us. Gabriel worked directly with Dave Mathewson, our former Vice President of Exploration, and Tom Chapin, Senior Consulting Geologist.
Gabriel completed his Master of Science Thesis in Geology (“Master Thesis”) entitled, “Igneous Geology of the Keystone Window, Simpson Park Mountains, Eureka County, Nevada: Age, Distribution Composition and Relationship to Carline-style Gold Mineralization”, dated December 2018. The Master Thesis is available at: https://www.usgoldcorp.gold/keystone-master-thesis.pdf.
 
Gabriel’s Master Thesis focused on the geology of the Keystone project. Before his work there was relatively little quality historical information data generated in the Keystone district. Gabriel’s work increased our overall understanding of the geology and opportunity of the Keystone district and resulted in important understandings of the district geology and age dating of the intrusives and associated hydrothermal gold systems at Keystone. It also provided some valuable timing information and mineral association characterization ranging from skarn mineralization to the broad, pervasive, epithermal-style mineralization.
 
We believe we are exploring a complex early Tertiary gold system comparable in size and character to many of the known large gold systems. The multiple and clustered intrusives and extrusives at Keystone range in composition from intermediate to very siliceous. All of the dates from numerous samples of these intrusive and extrusive rock units are early Tertiary (Eocene) in age and range from about 36 to 34.5Ma (million years ago). Age dating of illite alteration of andesite dikes at Keystone, believed to be associated with a major gold-epithermal event, provided dates of 35.71+/- 0.12Ma, and 35.54+/- 0.06Ma. These Keystone dates compare very closely with reported mineralization-related age dates from the major Cortez Hills gold deposit to the north, ranging from 35.70 +/-0.14 to 35.31 +/-0.37Ma (Arbonies, DG, Creel, KD, and Jackson, ML, 2010, Geological Society of Nevada Symposium Volume p.457).
 
In addition, Keystone has an important and large aeromagnetic expression of about 25sq km; this geophysical anomaly is comparable in size to those of the central and south Carlin and Battle Mountain District aeromagnetic expressions. Our geologists believe the hydrothermal gold system at Keystone is roughly comparable in size to those within the Twin Creeks, Battle Mountain, Carlin Trend, and Cortez Districts.
 
2018 Drill Results at Keystone Property, NV
 
On March 6, 2019, we announced results of our 2018 drilling program and receipt of all the assay results from the 20 square mile, Keystone project, in Nevada’s Cortez Trend. Highlights of the drilling program were:

● | 2018 drilling, comprised of a total of fifteen holes, and was conducted in two phases 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 1 drilling provided “scout” drill tests within several broad new target areas and was limited due to permitting constraints 
● | Phase 2 drilling began in early November (upon approval of the district-wide Environmental Assessment and Plan of Operations) and provided a first test to several drill targets in areas previously inaccessible due to permitting limitations 
● | Numerous holes intersected significant gold assay intervals 
 | (see below, Table 1: Summary of 2018 Keystone drill results)

This program was comprised of fifteen widely-spaced, reverse circulation target assessment holes, including two holes lost prematurely: Key 18-06rc & 18-12rc, and one re-drill of a lost hole, occupying the same site: Key18-10rc and 18-11rc. All holes were drilled into several large target zones and generally served as first-pass target assessment tests. The fifteen holes comprise a total of 25,310 feet (7,714 m). All of the holes encountered moderate to thick intervals of anomalous gold with moderate to locally very strong associated pathfinder metals. Many of these also intersected significant gold assay intervals; the results of which are provided in the results table (see below, Table 1: Summary of 2018 Keystone drill results).
 
Nine of the fifteen holes intersected lower-plate rock units; five of these holes penetrated the permissive host Wenban Formation. Eight holes encountered variably altered permissive upper-plate Comus calcareous siltstone. Multiple target horizons exist in the district and we are encountering, and having to contend with, the daunting issue of very great combined thickness of multiple favorable target horizons along with a broad, multi-structure corridor. The total prospective host unit thicknesses at Keystone are several thousand feet. These favorable rock units are variably exposed at the surface and, or at reasonably shallow drill hole depths in the district. Carlin-style zones of alteration with containing gold and pathfinders are very widespread and are present in all locations drilled to date.
 
Management believes the drilling at Keystone continues to show that the right ingredients are present for large gold deposits. The strong anomalous gold in the latest drill holes strengthens that belief. Finding the right structure and feeder zones that would host these large deposits becomes the focus of our 2019 program.
 
During 2018, we completed detailed geological mapping over the entire district, conducted a considerable amount of fill-in gravity to tighten up identification and qualification of structures and alteration features, and infilled and added soils and rock assaying to assist in zeroing in on new and existing target opportunities. With the Master Thesis information, we believe we are able to make important qualifications of the intrusive rock, especially those that are considered spatially and timing-wise important to target opportunities.
 
With the approval of the POO in September 2018, we can design a drill program specific to target assessment with multiple stage drill hole follow-ups, as warranted. This should improve future target evaluations not previously possible.
 
The drilling conducted to date, combined with the recently obtained and assessed geophysical and geochemical data may enable us to locate and qualify the gold-bearing fluid conduits that have supplied the gold to the gold-bearing mineral system that is in evidence within the Keystone district.
 
The Keystone 2018 phase 2 program was started in November 2018 and had to demobilize by the end of December 2018 due to the winter weather. Of the multiple targets identified, we were able to drill six holes, including Key18-10rc, which was lost and re-drilled at the same site with Key18-11rc, and hole Key18-12rc, which was lost above the target zone. The analysis of these six drill holes have yielded important additional information to our overall exploration efforts and ongoing target refinement.
 
Additional highlights of the 2018 Keystone exploration program are:
 

● | The Keystone District is located along the southeast extension of the Pipeline-Cortez District corridor as confirmed by the presence of an early-Tertiary complex intrusive center, widespread gold and pathfinder metal distribution, the presence of permissive host rocks of both upper- and lower-plate Paleozoic transitional carbonate rocks, the presence of a strong north-northwest-trending gravity and magnetic linear, and the spatially coincident Strontium 86/87 (.706) data generally considered to be indicative of probable source of gold along a major right-lateral north-northwest-trending suture within Proterozoic and, or Archean oceanic crustal rocks below the Paleozoic transitional host rock package.

● | Multiple, Carlin-type gold deposit target settings are present within the twenty square mile area Keystone District, controlled by us. These targets have been and are continuing to be synthesized from large volumes of historic and newly acquired, comprehensive exploration data, including CSAMT, aeromagnetics, detailed gravity, detailed geologic mapping, and abundant new surface geochemistry. Each new drill hole lends towards new target synthetization and direction.

● | Prospective host rocks for gold mineralization at Keystone include upper-plate Cambrian Comus Formation, comprised largely of calcareous siltstones very similar to Comus host rocks in the Getchell and Twin Creeks District to the northwest, and the lower-plate Horse Canyon, Wenban, and upper Roberts Mountains Formations of Devonian age, and the Silurian age Roberts Mountains Formation. Detailed litho-stratigraphic analyses at Keystone show that the Wenban is very similar, if not essentially identical, to the primary host Wenban unit in the Pipeline-Cortez District. The total prospective host unit thicknesses at Keystone comprise several thousand feet. These favorable rock units are variably exposed at the surface and, or at reasonably shallow drill hole depths in the District. The Master Thesis, focused on the Keystone intrusive and extrusive rock units, demonstrated the presence of a very complex, early-Tertiary intrusive/extrusive magmatic setting of very similar character and ages to those in the Cortez District just to the north.

● | 2018 drilling, comprising a total of fifteen holes, was conducted in two phases (see below, Table 1: Summary of 2018 Keystone drill results). Phase 1 provided drill tests within several broad target areas - and was limited in extent as a result of permitting constraints to this earlier point in time under the 5 acres of disturbance notice of intent (NOI) constraints. Phase 2 drilling began in early November immediately upon Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approval of the district-wide Environmental Assessment (EA) and Plan of Operations (POO). 
● | All fifteen holes were drilled by reverse circulation methods and sampling was conducted under the supervision of our Project Geologist, Kenneth Coleman, and generally assayed each five-foot interval split using Bureau Veritas Mineral Laboratories pulp preparation facility in Elko, NV. Resulting pulps were shipped to Bureau Veritas certified laboratory in Sparks, NV, or Vancouver BC, and analyzed for gold using fire assay fusion and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) finish on a 30-gram pulp split. All other elements were determined by ICP analyses. Data verification of the analytical results included a statistical analysis of the standards and blanks that must pass parameters of acceptance.

2019 Planned Drill Program at Keystone Property, NV
 
On June 6, 2019, we announced the commencement of the 2019 drilling program at the Keystone Project. The program is designed to test several drill targets in areas previously inaccessible with a drill because of permitting limitations and follow up on encouraging results from late 2018 drilling. Identification and qualification of these targets has been in progress since the onset of the exploration program almost 3 years ago. This targeting effort has included iterative detailed gravity surveys, detailed geological mapping and associated prospecting, rock sampling and detailed gridded soil surveys, in addition to prior scout hole drilling. 2016-2018 scout-type drill holes, comprised of 34 individual holes drilled from 15 total drill sites, have importantly added to the knowledge of, and geological understandings of the permissive lithologies and favorable stratigraphy of the project. Scout drilling encountered thick sections of permissive host rocks, including Comus, Horse Canyon, Wenban, and Roberts Mountains Formations (similar host rock packages to the sizeable deposits at the north of the Cortez Trend), hosting anomalous to multiple gram gold intervals associated with very anomalous and thick intervals of pathfinder metals. The 2019 drilling program is now expected to provide a first test to some of the most compelling targets on the Keystone project.

The following provides a brief summary description of these prioritized 2019 Keystone drill targets:
 
Greenstone Gulch
 
Two holes are planned in this area (PH-1 and PH-6). There has been no previous drilling in the Greenstone Gulch target area. Upper Plate Cambrian-Ordovician Comus Formation calcareous siltstones, limestones and greenstones are exposed at surface and are variably altered along NW and NE trending, partly dacitic dike filled structural zones. Lower Plate Devonian rocks are expected at shallow depths below surface. Surface soil and rock geochemistry shows a strong pathfinder element anomaly coincident with the NW structural zones. Targeting collapse breccias and bedding replacements developed in lower Comus, at the Devonian Horse Canyon-Wenban contact, and in Wenban Unit 5.
Sophia
 
Two holes will be drilled (PH-2 and PH-7) to follow up on previous drilling in the target area, especially hole Key18-09rc. Hole Key18-09rc encountered over 350 feet of nearly continuous oxidized breccia at the bottom, where it was lost at 1,605 feet in a 20-foot-wide open void. The oxidized breccia is located in Horse Canyon below a thick section of Comus skarn and hornfels. Comus skarn above the oxidized breccia yielded a 20-foot intercept of 1.135 g/t gold in garnet-magnetite skarn. The breccia at depth displays strongly anomalous gold, arsenic, thallium, mercury and many other elements, including thallium over 380 ppm. Sophia is located at the intersection of two broad NNW and NNE trending structural zones, the intersection being coincident with the strongest pathfinder soil anomalies at Keystone, a large gravity low and strong surface alteration characterized by bleaching, Fe staining, silicification and barite-alunite. Targeting a large collapse breccia developed in Horse Canyon and Wenban, similar in style and geometry to the Cortez Hills breccia deposit.
Tip Top
 
Two holes are planned (PH-3 and PH-8) to follow up on previous drilling in the target area, which encountered encouraging gold and Carlin-style alteration and pathfinder geochemistry. The target is located at the intersection of a major NNW trending structural zone with several NNE and NE trending fault zones which down-drop Upper Plate rocks against Lower Plate rocks. The NNW structural zone is identified as a district scale mineralized conduit at Keystone. Surface soil and rock geochemistry shows a strong pathfinder and gold anomaly coincident with a large gravity low in the immediate target area. Previous drilling has shown gold, Carlin-style alteration and oxidation are increased along the NNW structural zone. In addition, a long strike length, NW striking-shallow dipping structure was identified in previous drilling, with associated gold and dolomitization. Targeting a shallow, Goldrush-style breccia and replacement deposit developed at the intersection of the broad NNW trending structural zone with the NW striking, shallow dipping structure, and collapse breccias developed in Wenban Unit 5 in the footwall of the major NNW structural zone.
 
McClusky West
 
One hole is planned (PH-4), southwest of the Sophia target area. Very shallow historic drilling to the west of the target area tested strong Carlin-style alteration and surface geochemical anomalies, characterized mostly by silicification and bleaching with anomalous arsenic-antimony-thallium-mercury and gold. A large gravity low is present here, coincident with an arcuate feature-landslide scarp located at the intersection of a broad NNE structural zone and a major WNW fault. In addition, at this location Lower Plate rocks are further away from the aureoles of the Walti and Mud Springs intrusives than the Sophia target area. Targeting a large collapse breccia similar in style to Cortez Hills, developed in Devonian Horse Canyon and Wenban carbonates.

Mud Springs
 
One hole is planned (PH-5), in this target area with no previous drilling. A pronounced gravity low is present with the mapped Mud Springs intrusion, adjacent to where a major NNW structural zone that serves as a district scale conduit at Keystone is projected to cut the intrusion. At the location of the gravity low, a geochemically anomalous NNE structural zone projected southwest from the Breccia Ridge target area forms an intersection zone with the major NNW structural zone. A recessive zone surrounded by variably brecciated exposures of marble (Wenban likely) with anomalous arsenic and other elements is present as well, with a few rock chips of quartz veins and silicified diorite yielding anomalous gold to 41 ppb. Targeting a confined collapse breccia developed in marble adjacent to the Mud Springs intrusion, of a similar style to Deep Star on the Carlin Trend.
Nina Skarn
 
One hole is planned (PH-9), in this new target area with no previous drilling. Devonian Horse Canyon and Wenban pyroxene skarn and hornfels are present at surface, coincident with a +2,000-foot-long gold soil anomaly with up to 200 ppb samples and associated coincident anomalous Te-Bi-Zn-Ag. This anomalous skarn zone is parallel to and appears confined to the east of a major NNW structural zone which confines strong Carlin-style alteration to the south in the Sophia Target. At the proposed hole location, several WNW trending structures are mapped cutting the skarn, with anomalous arsenic and thallium coincident with their surface traces. The potential for both gold bearing skarn and skarn hosted Carlin-type mineralization (ie. Fourmile, Deep Star) is good at this location; both ideas are the targets being pursued for this proposed hole.
Breccia Ridge
 
One hole is planned (PH-10), to the north of U.S. Gold Corp’s previous drilling, where one of the largest gravity lows at Keystone is strongest and is coincident with the intersection of several NNE and WNW striking faults. At the intersection, surface soil geochemistry is strongly anomalous in arsenic, with anomalous thallium surrounding the arsenic high. Ordovician Valmy chert and quartzite is exposed at surface, showing strong Fe and As oxide staining, barite-alunite, silicification, and bleaching. A circular collapse-looking feature is localized at the direct intersection of the NNE and WNW structural zones, suggesting a moderately plunging breccia body may be present at depth. Upper Plate Cambrian-Ordovician Comus and Lower Plate Devonian carbonates are projected to be at reasonable drilling depths at the target location and are the targeted units for potentially mineralized collapse breccia development.
Quality Control Procedures for Keystone
 
We apply industry standard practice to quality control of drilling, sampling and assaying. Both phase 1 and phase 2 drilling at Keystone was carried out in 2018 by Envirotech Drilling LLC of Winnemucca, NV using a reverse circulation drill rig. RC cuttings were run through a rotary splitter on the drill as drilling advanced, which is industry standard, and a representative sample collected from the discharge point of the splitter. Chip samples were bagged and labeled by the drillers and then picked up from the site by a Bureau Veritas Minerals Laboratories Technician and taken to their Elko prep facility. Samples were prepped in Elko and then the pulps were shipped by BV to their lab in Sparks, NV for analysis. BV Labs crushed, split and pulverized 250g of rock to 200 mesh and fire assayed the samples. Assay certificates were received, analyzed, summarized and reported by our geologic team. As standard practice, certified blanks and standards were inserted into the sample stream at the lab on regular intervals, by us and BV. As assay results were received the analyzed assay values for given blanks or standards were visually compared to the expected assay values, and if they fell within the expected range of deviation as provided by the blank-standard provider, they were considered “passed” and the assay results can be relied upon. If the analyzed results did not fall within the expected range of deviation, the blank or standard was considered “failed” and BV was asked to re-run the blank or standard for gold fire-assay, along with the preceding two drill hole samples and the two proceeding the failed blank or standard. When re-run assay results were received, they were compared with the original results and deemed acceptable or not. All results to date have met our acceptability using the above-mentioned protocols.

Gold Bar North Project, Cortez Trend, Nevada
 
In August 2017, we closed on a transaction under a purchase and sale agreement executed in June 2017 with Nevada Gold Ventures LLC, pursuant to which we purchased all right, title and interest in the Gold Bar North Property, a gold exploration project located in Eureka County, Nevada. The purchase price for the Gold Bar North Property was: (a) cash payment in the amount of $20,479 which was paid in August 2017 and (b) 15,000 shares of our common stock which were issued in August 2017. David Mathewson, our then Chief Geologist (now former) was the managing member of Nevada Gold Ventures LLC. Gold Bar North consists of 49 unpatented lode mining claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada. We do not consider the Gold Bar North Property as a material property and are currently focusing the majority of our limited resources on exploration activities at the Copper King and Keystone properties.
Figure 4 – Gold Bar North Project Claim Boundaries
 
Competition
 
We do not compete directly with anyone for the exploration or removal of minerals from our property as we hold all interest and rights to the claims. Readily available commodities markets exist in the U.S. and around the world for the sale of minerals. Therefore, we will likely be able to sell minerals that we are able to recover. We will be subject to competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry in the event spot shortages arise for supplies such as explosives or large equipment tires, and certain equipment such as bulldozers and excavators and services, such as contract drilling that we will need to conduct exploration. If we are unsuccessful in securing the products, equipment and services we need, we may have to suspend our exploration plans until we are able to secure them.

Compliance with Government Regulation
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the United States generally.
 
Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required in conducting our exploration, development and other programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder in the United States. A leak that exceeded our permit limitations was detected in the Barren Pond. We have reported the occurrence as required by the permit, routed process fluids around the pond, and are now actively working on locating the leak and repairing it. No interruptions to operations are anticipated. This leak did not constitute a release to the environment, as the pond is triple lined and the leak was into the leak detection sump, above two of the three lines layers of the system.
 
On lands owned by the United States, mining rights are governed by the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended (“General Mining Law”), which allows the location of mining claims on certain federal lands upon the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit and compliance with location requirements. The exploration of mining properties and development and operation of mines is governed by both federal and state laws. Federal laws that govern mining claim location and maintenance and mining operations on federal lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) are generally administered by the BLM. Additional federal laws, governing mine safety and health, also apply. State laws also require various permits and approvals before exploration, development or production operations can begin. Among other things, a reclamation plan must typically be prepared and approved, with bonding in the amount of projected reclamation costs. The bond is used to ensure that proper reclamation takes place, and the bond will not be released until that time. Local jurisdictions may also impose permitting requirements (such as conditional use permits or zoning approvals).
 
Future exploration drilling on any of our properties that consist of BLM land will require us to either file a Notice of Intent (NOI) or a Plan of Operations with the BLM, depending upon the amount of new surface disturbance that is planned. A Notice of Intent is required for planned surface activities that anticipate less than 5.0 acres of surface disturbance, and usually can be obtained within a 30 to 60-day time period. Currently, we are working off 5 separate NOIs at Keystone. A Plan of Operations will be required if there is greater than 5.0 acres of new surface disturbance involved with the planned exploration work. A Plan of Operations can take several months to be approved, depending on the nature of the intended work, the level of reclamation bonding required, the need for archeological surveys and other factors as may be determined by the BLM. We filed our Environmental Assessment with the BLM in Q1, 2018. We received the Finding of No Significant Impact at the end of September 2018. This Plan of Operations gives us 200 acres of surface disturbance and greatly expands our exploration potential. In September 2018, U.S. Gold Corp. advanced an additional reclamation bond payment of $319,553 for the first 50-acre disturbance. After receiving all final permits and sign offs for road work, drill pad and surface disturbance, in November 2018, we commenced our Autumn 2018 drilling program at Keystone.
 
Environmental Permitting Requirements
 
Various levels of governmental controls and regulations address, among other things, the environmental impact of mineral mining and exploration operations and establish requirements for reclamation of mineral mining and exploration properties after exploration operations have ceased. With respect to the regulation of mineral mining and exploration, legislation and regulations in various jurisdictions establish performance standards, air and water quality emission limits and other design or operational requirements for various aspects of the operations, including health and safety standards. Legislation and regulations also establish requirements for reclamation and rehabilitation of mining properties following the cessation of operations and may require that some former mining properties be managed for long periods of time after mining activities have ceased.
 
Our activities are subject to various levels of federal and state laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including requirements for closure and reclamation of mineral exploration properties. Some of the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and related state laws in Nevada. Additionally, much of our property is subject to the federal General Mining Law of 1872, which regulates how mining claims on federal lands are located and maintained.

The State of Nevada, where we focus our mineral exploration efforts, requires mining projects to obtain a Nevada State Reclamation Permit pursuant to the Mined Land Reclamation Act (the “Nevada MLR Act”), which establishes reclamation and financial assurance requirements for all mining operations in the state. New and expanding facilities are required to provide a reclamation plan and financial assurance to ensure that the reclamation plan is implemented upon completion of operations. The Nevada MLR Act also requires reclamation plans and permits for exploration projects that will result in more than five acres of surface disturbance on private lands.
 
For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019 and April 30, 2018, our compliance costs regarding environmental permitting requirements and consultancy were $84,380 and $188,433 respectively. We paid approximately $74,840 to Wood Environment and Infrastructure Solutions, Inc. during fiscal 2019 and paid approximately $200,100 to Amec Foster Wheeler plc during fiscal 2018.
