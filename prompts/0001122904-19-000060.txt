Item 1. Business
General
We are a global company that delivers innovative networking and Internet connected products to consumers and businesses. We operate and report in two segments: Connected Home, and Small and Medium Business (“SMB”). The Connected Home segment is focused on consumers and consists of high-performance, dependable and easy-to-use 4G/5G mobile, Wi-Fi internet networking solutions and smart devices such as Orbi Voice smart speakers and Meural digital canvas. The SMB segment is focused on small and medium-sized businesses and consists of business networking, storage, wireless LAN and security solutions that bring enterprise-class functionality to small and medium-sized businesses at an affordable price. We are organized into the following three geographic territories: Americas; Europe, Middle-East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific (“APAC”).
On February 6, 2018, we announced that the Board of Directors had unanimously approved the pursuit of a separation of our smart camera business “Arlo” from NETGEAR (the “Separation”) to be effected by way of initial public offering (“IPO”) and spin-off. On August 2, 2018, Arlo and NETGEAR announced the pricing of Arlo's IPO and subsequently listed on the New York Stock Exchange on August 3, 2018 under the symbol “ARLO”. Upon completion of the IPO on August 7, 2018, we held approximately 84.2% of the outstanding shares of Arlo common stock. On December 31, 2018, we completed the distribution of 62,500,000 shares of the outstanding common stock of Arlo to NETGEAR’s shareholders (the “Distribution”) and no longer own any shares of Arlo common stock. Upon Arlo's Distribution on December 31, 2018, Arlo’s historical financial results for periods prior to the Distribution are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for the periods presented. For further detail, refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We were incorporated in Delaware on January 8, 1996. Our website address is www.netgear.com.
In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we generated net revenue of $1.06 billion, $1.04 billion, and $1.14 billion, respectively.

Markets
Our mission is to be the innovative leader in connecting the world to the internet. Our goal includes being the provider of industry-leading networking and smart connected products for consumers, businesses, and service providers. There are a number of factors that are driving today's demand for products within these markets. The ever-growing number of internet connected devices, such as smart phones, laptops, tablets and the advent of Smart Home and Internet-of-Things devices has increased the need for more robust networking solutions. The internet has enabled information and resource sharing via both local area networks, and more broadly via the internet. To take advantage of complex applications, advanced communication capabilities and rich multimedia content, internet connections are being upgraded by deploying high-speed broadband access technologies. Users also seek the convenience and flexibility of operating their laptops, smart phones, tablets and related computing devices while accessing their content in a more mobile, or wireless, manner. Increased market demand for Smart Home and internet-connected products, such as Smart TVs, game consoles, HD streaming players, security cameras, thermostats, smoke detectors, smart speakers and voice controlled assistants, etc., continue to drive new innovations in networking and related service offerings. As a result, the need and desire for more convenience, speed, coverage range, and reliability of an in-home Wi-Fi network as well as mobile cellular networks has become a greater priority among households as well as businesses.
Consumers, businesses and service providers demand a complete set of wired and wireless networking as well as broadband products that are tailored to their specific needs and budgets, while incorporating the latest networking technologies. Although these users desire the continual introduction of new advanced technologies, they often lack technical knowledge and resources. Therefore, a seamless 'plug-and-play' or easy-to-install experience with no need for customer service and support is the expected norm. We have also observed that this audience prefers the convenience of obtaining a networking solution from a single company and we have seen that they tend to be loyal purchasers of a brand with which they have had a good experience. Purchasing decisions in these markets are driven by the affordability and reliability of the products. To provide reliable, easy-to-use products at an attractive price, we believe a successful supplier must have a company-wide focus on the unique requirements of these markets, operational discipline and a cost-efficient infrastructure with processes that allow for efficient product development, manufacturing and distribution.
Sales Channels
We sell our products through multiple sales channels worldwide, including wholesale distributors, traditional and online retailers, direct market resellers ("DMRs"), value-added resellers ("VARs"), and broadband service providers.
Wholesale Distribution. Our distribution channel supplies our products to retailers, e-commerce resellers, DMRs, VARs and broadband service providers. We sell directly to our distributors, the largest of which are Ingram Micro, Inc., D&H Distributing Company and Tech Data Corporation. 
Retailers. Our retail channel primarily supplies products that are sold into the consumer market. However, increasingly we are seeing products designed for small and medium-sized businesses move through these channels. We sell directly to, or enter into consignment arrangements with, a number of our traditional and online retailers. The remaining traditional retailers, as well as our online retailers, are fulfilled through wholesale distributors. We work directly with our retail channels on market development activities, such as co-advertising, on-line promotions and video demonstrations, instant rebate programs, event sponsorship and sales associate training. Our largest retailers include Best Buy Co., Inc., Amazon.com, Inc. and their affiliates. 
DMRs and VARs. We sell into the business marketplace through an extensive network of DMRs and VARs. Our DMRs include companies such as CDW and Insight. VARs include our network of registered NETGEAR Solution Partners. DMRs and VARs may receive sales incentives, marketing support and other program benefits from us. Our DMRs and VARs generally purchase our products through our wholesale distributors.
Broadband Service Providers. We also supply our products directly to broadband service providers in the United States and internationally providing cable, DSL and 4G/5G mobile broadband. Service providers supply our products to their business and home subscribers. Our largest broadband service providers include AT&T and Telstra.
The largest portion of our net revenues was derived from Americas sales in the year ended December 31, 2018. Americas sales as a percentage of net revenue was 66.2% in the year ended December 31, 2018, up from 64.0% in the year ended December 31, 2017. We have continuously committed resources to our international operations and sales channels. Accordingly, we are subject to a number of risks related to international operations such as macroeconomic and microeconomic conditions, geopolitical instability, preference for locally branded products, exchange rate fluctuations, increased difficulty in managing 
2

inventory, challenges of staffing and managing foreign operations, the effect of international sales on our tax structure, and changes in local tax laws. For further information regarding these risks, refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Best Buy Co., Inc. and affiliates and Amazon and affiliates each accounted for 10% or more of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Product Offerings
Our products are built on a variety of proven technologies such as wireless (Wi-Fi and 4G/5G mobile), Ethernet and powerline, with a focus on reliability and ease-of-use. Our product line consists of devices that create and extend wired and wireless networks as well as devices that provide a special function and attach to the network, such as digital canvasses and smart mesh Wi-Fi speakers. These products are available in multiple configurations to address the changing needs of our customers in each geographic region in which our products are sold. Auxiliary to these hardware offerings, we have added services for our installed base of customers through applications available via subscription models that deliver more features that enhance the experience with our products.
Smart Home / Connected Home / Broadband access. Products that create and extend wired and wireless networks in homes and small businesses to connect devices to the internet, enable connection to broadband networks, as well as devices that connect to the internet in delivering functionality. These products are sold primarily via brick and mortar retail, e-commerce, and service provider channels and include:

• | Broadband modems, which are devices that convert the broadband signals into Ethernet data that feeds Internet into homes and offices. We provide modems that connect to DOCSIS 3.x, xDSL, FTTx, and 4G/5G mobile;


• | Wi-Fi Gateways, which are Wi-Fi routers with an integrated broadband modem, for broadband Internet access;


• | Wi-Fi Hotspots, which create mobile Wi-Fi Internet access that utilizes 4G/5G mobile and 5G data networks for use on the go, and at home in place of traditional wired broadband, Internet access;

• | Unified storage, which delivers file and block based data into a single shared storage system, meeting the demands of small enterprises, education, hospitality and health markets through an easy-to-use interface for managing multiple storage protocols; and


• | Internet security appliances, which provide internet access through capabilities such as firewalls and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

We design our products and services to meet the specific needs of the consumer, business and service provider markets, tailoring various elements of the software interface, the product design, including component specification, physical characteristics such as casing, design and coloration, and specific user interface features to meet the needs of these markets. We also leverage many of our technological developments, high volume manufacturing, technical support and engineering infrastructure across our markets to maximize business efficiencies.
Our products that target the business market are generally designed with an industrial appearance, including metal cases and, for some product categories, the ability to mount the product within standard data networking racks as well as unique mounting solutions for other uses. These products typically include higher port counts, higher data transfer rates and other performance characteristics designed to meet the needs of a business user. For example, we offer data transfer rates up to ten gigabits per second for our business products to meet the higher capacity requirements of business users. Some of these products are also designed to support transmission modes such as fiber optic cabling, which is common in more sophisticated business environments. Security requirements within our products for business broadband access include firewall and VPN capabilities that allow for secure interactions between remote offices and business headquarter locations over the internet. Our connectivity product offerings for the business market include enhanced security and remote configurability often required in a business setting. Our ReadyNAS® family of network attached storage products implements redundant arrays of independent disks (RAID) data protection, enabling businesses to store and protect critical data easily, efficiently and intelligently. 
Our vision for the home network is about intelligently controlling and monitoring all devices connected to the home network at all times, thus creating a Smart Environment. Our focus is to continue to introduce new products and services into growth areas that form the basis of Smart Homes, such as: the fastest Wi-Fi standards with broadest coverage via latest technology (802.11ax) Wi-Fi routers and home Wi-Fi systems; high speed DOCSIS 3.1, xDSL and fiber gateways with more integrated functions; 5G mobile gateways and mobile hotspots; Digital Canvasses; and other automation devices. We continue to announce and introduce new products in these key markets.
Our vision for the business network is to increase the effectiveness, efficiency and supportability of the hybrid cloud access network. We believe small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to move into cloud-based applications, such as: Salesforce.com, Ring Central, Zoom video conferencing, SuccessFactors, Workday, and others. In addition, we believe these enterprises will move into utility-like on demand computing power supplied by third party data centers. Also, increasingly more enterprises are enabling the BYOD (bring your own device) environment allowing smart phones, tablets, and netbooks to be the business computing devices of choice. We believe that the need for cost efficient and easy-to-use video surveillance by small businesses and corporate offices will continue to grow and fuel the growth of our POE(+) market, with its ability to power 4K cameras. These trends will place a greater demand on business networks. To meet this demand we are introducing next generation technology, such as: Enhanced Power over Ethernet (PoE) switches, Multi-gigabit Ethernet switches, Wi-Fi mesh systems, high capacity local and remote unified storage, small to medium capacity campus wireless LAN, and security appliances. In addition, our Insight line of cloud-connected networking devices can be managed remotely and securely via mobile Apps or Browser interfaces, providing continuous monitoring and instantaneous fault notification.

Competition
The consumer, business and service provider markets are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change. We expect competition to continue to intensify. Our principal competitors include:

• | within the consumer markets, companies such as ARRIS, ASUS, AVM, Linksys (owned by Foxconn), Devolo, D-Link, Eero (which recently agreed to be purchased by Amazon), Google, Samsung, Synology, Symantec, TP Link, and Western Digital;


• | within the business markets, companies such as Allied Telesys, Barracuda, Buffalo, Cisco Systems, Dell, D-Link, Fortinet, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, QNAP Systems, Seagate Technology, SonicWall, Synology, TP Link, Ubiquiti, WatchGuard and Western Digital; and

4


• | within the service provider markets, companies such as Actiontec, Airties, Arcadyan, ARRIS, ASUS, AVM, Compal Broadband, D-Link, Eero (which recently agreed to be purchased by Amazon), Franklin, Google, Hitron, Huawei, Novatel Wireless, Plume, Sagem, Sercomm, SMC Networks, TechniColor, TP-Link, Ubee, ZTE and ZyXEL.

Our potential competitors include other consumer electronics vendors, including Amazon, Apple, LG Electronics, Microsoft, Panasonic, Sony, Toshiba and Vizio, who could integrate networking and streaming capabilities into their line of products, such as televisions, set top boxes, voice assistants and gaming consoles, and our channel customers who may decide to offer self-branded networking products. We also face competition from service providers who may bundle a free networking device with their broadband service offering, which would reduce our sales if we were not the supplier of choice to those service providers. In the service provider space, we also face significant and increased competition from original design manufacturers ("ODMs") and contract manufacturers ("CMs") who are selling and attempting to sell their products directly to service providers around the world.
Many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources. As a result, they may have more advanced technology, larger distribution channels, stronger brand names, better customer service and access to more customers than we do. For example, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise has significant brand name recognition and has an advertising presence substantially greater than ours. Similarly, Cisco Systems is well recognized as a leader in providing networking products to businesses, while Google competes in the consumer Wi-Fi product market, and both have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Several of our competitors, such as TP-Link, offer a range of products that directly compete with most of our product offerings. Several of our other competitors primarily compete in a more limited manner. For example, Cisco and Dell sell networking products primarily targeted at larger businesses or enterprises. However, the competitive environment in which we operate changes rapidly. Other companies with significant resources could also become direct competitors, either through acquiring a competitor or through internal efforts.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the consumer, business and service provider markets for networking products include product breadth, size and scope of the sales channel, brand name, timeliness of new product introductions, product availability, performance, features, functionality and reliability, price, ease-of-installation, maintenance and use, and customer service and support. We believe our products are competitive in these markets based on these factors.
To remain competitive, we must invest significant resources in developing new products and enhancing our current products while continuing to expand our sales channels and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide.
Research and Development
Our success depends on our ability to develop products that meet changing user needs and to anticipate and proactively respond to evolving technology in a timely and cost-effective manner. Accordingly, we have made investments in our research and development department in order to effectively evaluate existing and new third-party technologies, develop existing and new in-house technologies, and develop and test new products and services. Our research and development employees work closely with our technology and manufacturing partners to bring our products to market in a timely, high quality and cost-efficient manner. 
We identify, qualify or self-develop new technologies to develop products using one or more of the methodologies described below.
ODM. Under the ODM methodology, we define the product concept and specification and recommend the technology selection. We then coordinate with our technology suppliers while they develop the product meeting our specification. On certain new products, one or more subsystems of the design can be done in-house and then integrated with the remaining design pieces from the ODM. Once prototypes are completed, we work with our partners to complete the debugging and systems integration and testing. After completion of the final tests, agency approvals and product documentation, the product is released for production.
In-House Development. Under the in-house development model, one or more subsystems of the product are designed and developed utilizing the NETGEAR engineering team. Under this model, some of the primary technology is developed in-house. We then work closely with either an ODM or a Joint Development Manufacturer ("JDM") to complete the development of the entire design, perform the necessary testing, and obtain regulatory approvals before the product is released for production.

Manufacturing
Our primary manufacturers are Cloud Network Technology (more commonly known as HonHai Precision or Foxconn Corporation), Delta Electronics Incorporated, Wistron NeWeb Corporation, and Pegatron Corporation, all of which are headquartered in Taiwan. Beginning in September 2018 and upon the introduction of Section 301 tariffs by the US government on a significant number of US bound products manufactured in China, we commenced a plan to migrate manufacturing locations substantially away from mainland China. We expect this migration to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2019 and upon completion substantially all of our manufacturing relating to US bound products will occur in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Taiwan. Products sourced for markets outside of the US will continue to be substantially manufactured in China and Vietnam. We distribute our manufacturing among our key suppliers to avoid excessive concentration with a single supplier. However, there has been an increase in supplier concentration since 2015 and we expect this concentration to continue over the course of 2019 to 2020. Any disruptions from natural disasters, health epidemics and political, social and economic instability would affect the ability of our manufacturers to manufacture our products. If our manufacturers or warehousing facilities are disrupted or destroyed, we would have no other readily available alternatives for manufacturing our products and our business would be significantly impacted. In addition to their responsibility for the manufacturing of our products, our manufacturers typically purchase all necessary parts and materials to produce complete, finished goods. To maintain quality standards for our suppliers, we have established our own product quality organization based in Hong Kong and mainland China. They are responsible for auditing and inspecting process and product quality on the premises of our ODMs and JDMs.
We obtain several key components from limited or sole sources. For example, many of the semiconductors used in our products are designed specifically for our products and are obtained from sole source suppliers on a purchase order basis. In addition, some components that are used in our products are obtained from limited sources. These components include connector jacks, plastic casings and physical layer transceivers. From a limited number of suppliers, we obtain switching fabric semiconductors, which are used in our Ethernet switches and internet gateway products; wireless local area network chipsets which are used in our wireless products and mobile network chipsets which are used in our wireless gateways and hotspots. Our third party manufacturers generally purchase these components on our behalf on a purchase order basis. If these sources fail to satisfy our supply requirements, our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries would be harmed and we may lose sales and experience increased component costs.
We currently outsource warehousing and distribution logistics to four main third-party providers who are responsible for warehousing, distribution logistics and order fulfillment. In addition, these parties are also responsible for some configuration and re-packaging of our products including bundling components to form kits, inserting appropriate documentation, disk drive configuration, and adding power adapters. APL Logistics Americas, Ltd. in City of Industry, California serves the Americas region, Kerry Logistics Ltd. in Hong Kong serves the Asia Pacific region, DSV Solutions B.V. Netherlands serves the EMEA region, and Brightstar Logistics Pty Ltd. in Melbourne, VIC, Australia serves Australia and New Zealand.
Sales and Marketing
We work directly with our customers on market development activities, such as co-advertising, online promotions and video demonstrations, event sponsorship and sales associate training. We also participate in major industry trade shows and marketing events. Our marketing department is comprised of our channel marketing, product marketing and corporate marketing groups.
Our channel marketing team focuses on working with the sales teams to maximize our participation in channel partner marketing activities and merchandise our products both online and in store.
Our product marketing group focuses on product strategy, product development roadmaps, the new product introduction process, product lifecycle management, demand assessment and competitive analysis. The group works closely with our sales and research and development groups to align our product development roadmap to meet customer technology demands from a strategic perspective. The group also ensures that product development activities, product launches, and ongoing demand and supply planning occur in a well-managed, timely basis in coordination with our development, manufacturing, and sales groups, as well as our ODM and sales channel partners.
Our corporate marketing group is responsible for defining and building our corporate brand and supporting the business units with creative and marketing strategies and tactics. The group focuses on defining our brand promise and marketing messages on a worldwide basis. This group is also responsible for driving the social media and online marketing strategy, public relations, 
6

install base marketing programs, community engagement programs, sponsorships and events, and corporate websites worldwide, as well as creative production for all product categories. 
We conduct most of our international sales and marketing operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries, which operate via sales and marketing subsidiaries and branch offices worldwide.
Customer Support
We design our products with ease-of-use top of mind. We respond globally to customer inquiries through a variety of channels including phone, chat, community, social, and email. Customers can also get self-help service through the comprehensive knowledgebase and the user forum from our website. Customer support is provided through a combination of a limited number of permanent employees and use of subcontracted, out-sourced resources. Our permanent employees design our technical support database and are responsible for training and managing our outsourced sub-contractors. They also handle escalations from the outsourced resources. We utilize the information gained from customers by our customer support organization to enhance our product offerings, including further simplifying the installation process. In 2018 we migrated to a unified platform to create efficiency and improve our customer experience.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our continued success will depend primarily on the technical expertise, speed of technology implementation, creative skills and management abilities of our officers and key employees, plus ownership of a limited but important set of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents. We primarily rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and patent laws, nondisclosure agreements with employees, consultants and suppliers and other contractual provisions to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. We hold approximately 197 issued United States patents that expire between years 2019 and 2037 and 93 foreign patents that expire between 2019 and 2035. In addition, we currently have approximately 109 pending United States and foreign patent applications related to technology and products offered by us. We also rely on third-party licensors for patented hardware and software license rights in technology that are incorporated into and are necessary for the operation and functionality of our products. Our success will depend in part on our continued ability to have access to these technologies.
We have trade secret rights for our products, consisting mainly of product design, technical product documentation and software. We also own, or have applied for registration of trademarks, in connection with our products in the United States and internationally, including NETGEAR, NETGEAR Armor, NPG, NPG logo, Everybody’s Connecting, AirCard, AirCard Enabled, Around Town, Orbi, Genie, Genie+, the Genie logo, ReadyShare, Neo TV, the Neo TV logo, ProSafe, RangeMax, ReadyNAS, ReadyDrop, ReadyData, ReadyCloud, ReadyDLNA, ReadyRecover, ProSecure, the ProSecure logo, Push2TV, Streampro, Centria, My Media, Nighthawk, Nighthawk x4, Nighthawk x6, Overdrive, Overdrive 3G/4G Mobile Hotspot logo, Zing Mobile Hotspot, Mingle, Ufast, NETGEAR Insight, NETGEAR UP, VIZN, FASTLANE, FASTLANE3, Meural, Trueart, Digital Canvas, and X-RAID.
We have registered a number of internet domain names that we use for electronic interaction with our customers including dissemination of product information, marketing programs, product registration, sales activities, and other commercial uses.
Seasonal Business
We have historically experienced increased net sales in our third and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the first and second quarters in our fiscal year due to seasonal demand from consumer markets primarily relating to the beginning of the school year and the holiday season. This pronounced seasonality has been previously offset by irregular and significant purchases from customers in other markets, such as the service provider market. As the proportion of our revenue derived from consumer focused products grows relative to our overall business, the impact of the seasonally high third and fourth fiscal quarters shall become more pronounced than experienced in prior years.
Backlog
Our backlog consists of products for which customer purchase orders have been received and that are scheduled or in the process of being scheduled for shipment. As we typically fulfill orders received within a relatively short period (e.g., within a few weeks for our top three customers) after receipt, our revenue in any fiscal year depends primarily upon orders booked and the availability of supply of our products in that year. In addition, most of our backlog is subject to rescheduling or cancellation 
7

with minimal penalties. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date may not be an indicator of revenue for any succeeding period. Similarly, there is a lack of meaningful correlation between year-over-year changes in backlog as compared with year-over-year changes in revenue. Accordingly, we do not believe that backlog information is material to an understanding of our overall business, and backlog as of any particular date should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
Environmental Laws
Our products and manufacturing process are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which cover both the use of various materials as well as environmental concerns. Environmental issues such as pollution and climate change have had significant legislative and regulatory efforts on a global basis, and there are expected to be additional changes to the regulations in these areas. These changes could directly increase the cost of energy, which may have an impact on the way we manufacture products or utilize energy to produce our products. In addition, any new regulations or laws in the environmental area might increase the cost of raw materials we use in our products and the cost of compliance. Other regulations in the environmental area may require us to continue to monitor and ensure proper disposal or recycling of our products. To the best of our knowledge, we maintain compliance with all current government regulations concerning our production processes for all locations in which we operate. Since we operate on a global basis, this is also a complex process that requires continual monitoring of regulations and an ongoing compliance process to ensure that we and our suppliers are in compliance with all existing regulations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 837 full-time employees, with 312 in sales, marketing and technical support, 274 in research and development, 108 in operations, and 143 in finance, information systems and administration. We also utilize a number of temporary staff to supplement our workforce. We have never had a work stoppage among our employees and no personnel are represented under collective bargaining agreements.
