Item 1. Business
 
Hunt Mining Corp. (the “Company” or “Hunt”), is a mineral exploration company incorporated on January 10, 2006 under the laws of Alberta, Canada and, together with its subsidiaries, is engaged in the exploration of mineral properties in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina.
 
Effective November 6, 2013, the Company continued from the Province of Alberta to the Province of British Columbia. The Company’s registered office is located at 25th Floor, 700 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, B.C. V7Y 1B3. The Company’s head office is located at 23800 E Appleway Avenue, Liberty Lake, Washington, 99019 USA.
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the following subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances:
 
 
Corporation | Incorporation | Percentage ownership | Business Purpose 
----------------------------+-----------------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------
Cerro Cazador S.A. (“CCSA”) | Argentina | 100% | Holder of Assets and Exploration Company
Ganadera Patagonia(1) | Argentina | 40% | Land Holding Company 
1494716 Alberta Ltd. | Alberta | 100% | Nominee Shareholder 
Hunt Gold USA LLC | Washington, USA | 100% | Management Company 



The Company’s activities include the exploration of mineral properties in Argentina. On the basis of information to date, the Company has not yet determined whether the exploration properties contain economically recoverable ore reserves. The underlying value of the mineral properties is entirely dependent upon the existence of economically recoverable reserves, the ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to complete development and upon future profitable production or a sale of these properties.
 
The Company has one reportable segment, consisting of evaluation, acquisition and exploration activities which are focused principally in Argentina. The Company evaluates, acquires, and explores for advanced silver and gold exploration and potential development projects, which may lead to silver and gold production or value adding strategic transactions. In 2018, the Company continued exploration activities at the Martha project and began metallurgical testing of minerals mined at the La Josefina property. These activities resulted in recoveries from sale of silver and gold concentrate and have been reported as “Silver and gold recovery, net of expenses” in the amount of $397,135 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Geographic location of mineral properties and plant and equipment is provided in Item 2 – Properties and Notes 8 and 10 – Mineral Properties and Property and Equipment to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the section heading “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.
 
Competitive Business Conditions
 
The mineral exploration business is an extremely competitive industry. The Company is competing with other exploration companies for the capital necessary to sustain exploration and development programs. There is competition for the limited number of silver and gold acquisition and exploration opportunities. As a result, the Company may have difficulty acquiring attractive silver and gold projects at reasonable prices. The Company also competes for skilled labor and consultants for man hours and consulting time.

The year ended, 2017, was the first year of milling production for the refurbished Martha mill. The mill began limited trial operations in January of 2017, with regular milling activities of minerals from exploration activities commencing in April 2017. In addition to continued milling activities from the Martha project in 2018, the Company also expanded its exploration and milling activities to include mill pilot tests for floatation of gold and silver mineralized material from its La Josefina project. The risks associated exploration, mining and milling operations include risks typical of the mining industry. For example, the Company’s operational effectiveness in the processing plan must be properly calibrated and managed to avoid lower recovery of the economic metals. Mechanical failure of equipment could increase costs, decrease efficacy or result in significant delays. The Company manages these risks with detailed mine planning and extraction processes, a maintenance program, and hiring experienced and technically proficient management.
 
Generally, the Company is subject to the risks inherent to the mining industry. The primary risk of mineral exploration is the low probability of finding a major deposit of minerals. The Company attempts to mitigate this risk by focusing its efforts in areas known to host significant mineral deposits, and by relying on its experienced management team to drive acquisitions of properties that have higher-than-average probabilities of success.
 
When considering acquisition of properties, not only are essentials such as cost, terms, timing, and market considerations evaluated but also careful screening based on geological, engineering, environmental, and metallurgical factors. In all its operations, the Company competes for skilled labor within the mining industry.
 
Another significant risk in the mining industry is the price of metals such as gold and silver. If the prices of these metals were to fall substantially, it could lead to a loss of investor interest in the mineral exploration sector, which would increase the difficulty to raise capital necessary to move exploration and development plans forward.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Government Regulation
 
The Company’s exploration and development activities and other property interests are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in the United States, Argentina, and other jurisdictions, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. The Company has obtained or has pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct exploration and other programs. The Company believes that it complies in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations in all the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company is not aware of any current orders or directions relating to us with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations.
Environmental Regulation
 
The Company’s projects are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. The Company’s policy is to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. The Company believes that its operations are conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Changes to current local, state or federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where it operates could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. The Company is unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, or what additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of its projects. During 2018, none of the project sites had any material non-compliance occurrences with any applicable environmental regulations.
 
The Company generally will be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts would be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.
 
Employees
 
As at December 31, 2018, the Company had 31 full and part time employees and 10 individuals working on a consulting basis. Its operations are managed by officers with input from directors.
