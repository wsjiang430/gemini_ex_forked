Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a publicly traded residential lot development company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "FOR." At September 30, 2019, we had operations in 51 markets in 20 states. In October 2017, we became a majority-owned subsidiary of D.R. Horton, Inc. (D.R. Horton) by virtue of a merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary of D.R. Horton (Merger). Immediately following the Merger, D.R. Horton owned 75% of our outstanding common stock. As a controlling shareholder, D.R. Horton has significant influence in guiding our strategic direction and operations. At September 30, 2019, D.R. Horton owned approximately 66% of our outstanding common stock. 
In connection with the Merger, we entered into certain agreements with D.R. Horton including a Stockholder’s Agreement, a Master Supply Agreement, and a Shared Services Agreement. The Merger provides us an opportunity to grow our lot development business by establishing a strategic relationship to supply finished lots to D.R. Horton at market terms under the Master Supply Agreement. Under the terms of the Master Supply Agreement with D.R. Horton, both companies are identifying land development opportunities to expand our portfolio of assets. Our strategy is focused on making significant investments in land acquisition and development to expand our residential lot development business across a geographically diversified national platform. We are primarily investing in short duration, phased development projects that generate returns similar to production-oriented homebuilders. This strategy is a unique, lower risk business model that we expect will produce more consistent returns than other public and private land developers. At September 30, 2019, we owned or controlled through option purchase contracts approximately 38,300 residential lots. Approximately 12,800 of these residential lots are under contract to sell to D.R. Horton. Additionally, D.R. Horton has the right of first offer on approximately 10,600 of these residential lots based on executed purchase and sale agreements. At September 30, 2019, lots owned included approximately 4,400 that are fully developed, of which approximately 2,100 are related to lot banking.
 We manage our operations through one real estate reporting segment. Our results of operations, including information regarding our real estate segment, are discussed in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We conduct our operations in the states and markets listed below.

Business Operations
The majority of our real estate projects are single-family residential communities. We develop lots for single-family homes on sites we typically purchase in the open market and sell residential lots primarily to local, regional and national homebuilders. In certain markets where we do not have local development infrastructure in place, D.R. Horton provides development services to us for a fee. Our managers are responsible for the following activities related to our lot and land acquisition and development activities.

• | Site selection, which involves:

- A feasibility study;
- Soil and environmental reviews;
- Review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements;
- Review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements and to complete necessary infrastructure; and
- Financial analysis of the potential project;

• | Negotiating lot purchase, land acquisition and related contracts;


• | Obtaining all necessary land development approvals;


• | Selecting land development subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes;


• | Planning and managing land development schedules;


• | Determining the sales pricing for each lot in a given project;


• | Developing and implementing local marketing and sales plans; and


• | Coordinating all interactions with customers throughout the lot sale process.

Our corporate executives and corporate office personnel provide control and oversight functions to many important risk elements in our operations, including:

• | Allocation of capital;


• | Cash management;


• | Review and approval of business plans and budgets;


• | Review, approval and funding of lot and land acquisitions (Board of Directors must approve acquisitions greater than $20 million in accordance with the Stockholders’ Agreement);


• | Environmental assessments of land and lot acquisitions;


• | Review of all business and financial analysis for potential land and lot inventory investments;


• | Oversight of lot and land inventory levels;


• | Monitoring and analysis of profitability, returns and costs; and


• | Review of major personnel decisions and incentive compensation plans.

Our corporate executives and corporate office personnel are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations. We have a Shared Services Agreement with D.R. Horton whereby D.R. Horton provides us with certain administrative, compliance, operational and procurement services. Our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for, and provide oversight and review for, the following shared services performed by D.R. Horton:

• | Accounting, finance and treasury;


• | Risk and litigation management;


• | Corporate governance;


• | Information technology;


• | Income tax;

• | Internal audit;


• | Investor and media relations; and


• | Human resources, payroll and employee benefits.

We have a Master Supply Agreement (MSA) with D.R. Horton which establishes our business relationship with D.R. Horton as both companies identify residential real estate opportunities. The MSA provides D.R. Horton the right of first offer (ROFO) to purchase, at market prices and terms, up to 100% of the lots from D.R. Horton sourced projects and up to 50% of the lots in the first phase of a Forestar sourced project and up to 50% of the lots in any subsequent phase in which D.R. Horton purchases at least 25% of the lots in the previous phase. D.R. Horton has no ROFO rights on third-party sourced development opportunities. The MSA continues until the earlier of (i) the date at which D.R. Horton owns less than 15% of our voting shares or (ii) June 29, 2037; however, we may terminate the MSA at anytime when D.R. Horton owns less than 25% of our voting shares.
We have a Stockholder's Agreement with D.R. Horton which defines D.R. Horton’s right to nominate members to our board, requires D.R. Horton’s consent for certain transactions and established an investment committee. D.R. Horton has the right to nominate our board members commensurate with its equity ownership. As long as D.R. Horton owns at least 20% of our voting securities, it retains the right to nominate individuals to our board based on its equity ownership as well as designate the Executive Chairman. D.R. Horton nominated four of our five current board members.
As long as D.R. Horton owns at least 35% of our voting securities, we must obtain D.R. Horton’s consent to (i) issue any new class of equity or shares of our common stock in excess of certain amounts, (ii) incur, assume, refinance or guarantee debt that would increase our total leverage to greater than 40%, (iii) select, terminate, remove or change compensation arrangements for the Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other key senior management, and (iv) make an acquisition or investment greater than $20 million. The Stockholder’s Agreement also established an investment committee to approve new investments up to $20 million.
Land/Lot Acquisition and Inventory Management
We acquire land for use in our development operations after we have completed due diligence and after we have obtained the rights (known as entitlements) to begin development work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots. Before we acquire lots or tracts of land, we complete a feasibility study, which includes soil tests, independent environmental studies, other engineering work and financial analysis. We also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop the property for home construction. Although we purchase and develop land primarily to sell finished lots to homebuilders, we may sell land where we have excess land positions or for other strategic reasons.
We also enter into land purchase contracts, in which we obtain the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy land at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with planned development. These contracts generally are non-recourse, which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any pre-acquisition due diligence costs we incur. This enables us to control land with limited capital investment.
We attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by:

• | Managing our supply of lots and land owned and controlled under purchase contracts in each market based on anticipated future demand;


• | Monitoring local market and demographic trends that affect housing demand;


• | Limiting the size of our land development projects and focusing on short duration projects;


• | Acquiring fully-entitled land and developing the land in phases;


• | Focusing on developing lots for entry level housing, the segment where housing demand has been the highest;


• | Developing the majority of our lots for a known buyer; and


• | Geographically diversifying our land portfolio.

Land Development
Substantially all of our land development work is performed by subcontractors. Subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreed-upon price and within a specified time frame. We monitor land development activities, participate in major decisions, coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with building codes or other regulations. 
We typically do not maintain inventories of land development materials, except for work in progress materials for active development projects. Generally, the materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources. 
We contract with D.R. Horton for land development services in projects owned by us in geographic markets where we do not have established development teams and capabilities. 
We are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development operations. We may experience delays in receiving the proper approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that delay our anticipated development activities in certain projects.
Lot/Land Banking
In addition to our residential lot development activities, we also make short term investments in finished lots (lot banking) and undeveloped land with the intent to sell these assets within a short time period, primarily to D.R. Horton, utilizing available capital prior to its deployment into longer term lot development projects. We manage our level of lot/land banking relative to short term liquidity and expected future cash requirements for lot development projects.
Cost Controls
We control development costs by obtaining competitive bids for materials and labor. We monitor our land development expenditures versus budgets for each project, and we review our inventory levels, margins, expenses, profitability and returns for each project compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations.
Competition
We face significant competition for the acquisition, development and sale of real estate in our markets. Our major competitors include landowners who market and sell undeveloped land and numerous national, regional and local developers, including homebuilders. In addition, our projects compete with other development projects offering similar amenities, products and/or locations. Competition also exists for investment opportunities, financing, available land, raw materials and labor. Some of our real estate competitors are well established and financially strong, may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, or may be larger than us and/or have lower cost of capital and operating costs than we have and expect to have. The presence of competition may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell. These competitive market pressures can sometimes make it difficult to acquire, develop or sell lots and land at prices that meet our return criteria. 
The lot and land acquisition and development business is highly fragmented, and we are unaware of any meaningful concentration of national market share by any one competitor. Enterprises of varying sizes, from individuals or small companies to large corporations, actively engage in the real estate development business. Many competitors are local, privately-owned companies. We have a few regional and national land developer competitors in addition to national homebuilders that may develop lots on which they construct and sell homes. During periods when access to capital is restricted, participants in a weaker financial condition tend to be less active.
Employees
At September 30, 2019, we had 78 employees. None of our employees participate in collective bargaining arrangements. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees.

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to extensive and complex regulations. We and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal, state and local laws and regulations. These include zoning, density and development requirements and building, environmental, advertising, labor and real estate sales rules and regulations. These regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets. Our properties are subject to inspection by local authorities where required and may be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets, utilities and other public improvements.
