Our Customers
 
We provide our products and services primarily to governmental agencies. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our sales to federal, state and local governments accounted for approximately 100% and 40.1% of our net sales, respectively. Since inception, we have worked with over 500 customers company-wide since inception. These customers include, among others, federal and international government agencies as well as enterprise customers in retail, manufacturing, life sciences, biotechnology, high-tech, agriculture, financial services, state and local government, utilities, media and entertainment and telecommunications. Although we have had many customers, three customers generated approximately 60.0% and 24.7% of our gross revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. One customer accounted for 38% of our gross revenue in 2018; however, this customer may or may not continue to be a significant contributor to revenue in 2019. We plan to continue to focus our efforts on existing and potential government customers.
Our Market
 
Information about the Government IT Services and Solutions Market
 
In 2019, the U.S. government is projected to spend approximately $45.8 billion on information technology, which is slightly higher than the 2018 spending of approximately $45.6 billion for civilian agencies. According to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, this spending is expected to continue at a 3% growth rate as compared to 6% historically because of the government’s budget challenges. In addition, with respect to defense-related spending, the U.S. Department of Deference (“DoD”) is expected to spend over $45 billion on its information technology programs. Sysorex, through its wholly owned subsidiary, SGS, services U.S. government customers in both civilian and defense agencies with a variety of IT solutions and services (custom application development, project management, systems integration, etc.) through its various government contract vehicles including our GSA Schedule, SPAWAR, TEIS-III, SEWP, CIO-CS, and others. SGS may serve as the prime contractor or as the subcontractor, depending on the contract.

Sysorex believes it has an advantage in the government marketplace by holding three Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts (“GWACs”). A GWAC is a pre-competed, multiple-award, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract that agencies can use to buy total IT solutions, including both products and services. These types of contracts can sell into all government agencies and directly to contractors (typically large integrators) who have existing services contracts that require IT products or additional professional services.


Our GWACs include:
 

● | NASA SEWP V 
--+-------------------
● | NIH CIO-CS 
● | GSA IT 70 Schedule

 
The NASA SEWP V is a GWAC for commercial IT products and services, including, desktops and servers, IT peripherals, network equipment, storage systems, security tools, software products, cloud based services, telecommunication, Health IT, video conferencing systems and other IT and Audio-Visual products along with product based services such as installation, maintenance and other services related to in-scope products to all Federal agencies (including DOD) and their approved support service contractors. During 2018, NASA SEWP V spent over $6 billion on IT with the following agencies making up the majority of spending:
 

● | Department of Defense
--+----------------------
● | Army 
● | Air Force 
● | Navy 
● | Department of Justice

 
The NIH-CIO-CS is a GWAC for IT commodities/solutions that can be used by any Federal civilian or DoD agency focused on IT products and services, both on-site and in the cloud.
 
The GSA IT 70 Schedule is a GWAC that offers federal, state and local governments solutions to their IT needs. These solutions include cloud IT services, cyber security, data centers and storage, satellite services, telecommunications, wireless and mobility, and telepresence. Our GSA IT 70 Schedule is critical to the broadly used Blanket Purchase Agreement (“BPA”) and is available to all branches of government, including State, Local, and Education (“SLED”) customers. Here are some factors that we believe make a BPA attractive:



● | when there is a wide variety of items in a broad class of supplies or services that are generally purchased; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | when there is a need to provide commercial sources of supply for one or two more offices or projects that do not have or need authority to purchase otherwise; 
● | use would avoid writing multiple purchase orders; 
● | both agencies and vendors like BPAs because they help cut the red tape associated with repetitive purchasing; and 
● | once set up, repeat purchases are easy for both sides.

Through SGS, Sysorex enters into various types of contracts with our government customers, such as Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Completion, Cost-Reimbursement (CR), Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Fixed-Price Incentive (FPI) and Time-and-materials (T&M).
 
IDIQ contracts provide for an indefinite quantity of services or stated limits of supplies for a fixed period. They are used when the customer cannot determine, above a specified minimum, the precise quantities of supplies or services that the government will require during the contract period. IDIQs help streamline the contract process and speed service delivery. IDIQ contracts are most often used for service contracts and architect-engineering services. Awards are usually for base years and option years. The customer places delivery orders (for supplies) or task orders (for services) against a basic contract for individual requirements. Minimum and maximum quantity limits are specified in the basic contract as either a number of units (for supplies) or as dollar values (for services).
 
CPFF LOE contracts will be issued when the scope of work is defined in general terms requiring only that the contractor devote a specified level of effort, or LOE, for a stated time period. A CPFF completion contract will be issued when the scope of work defines a definite goal or target, which leads to an end product deliverable (e.g., a final report of research accomplishing the goal or target).


CR contracts provide for payment of allowable incurred costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract. These contracts establish an estimate of total cost for the purpose of obligating funds and establishing a ceiling that the contractor may not exceed (except at its own risk) without the approval of the contracting officer and are suitable for use only when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.
 
FFP contracts are issued when acquiring supplies or services on the basis of definite or detailed specifications and fair and reasonable prices can be established at the outset.
 
FPI target delivery contracts will be issued when acquiring supplies or services on the basis of reasonably definite or detailed specifications and cost can be reasonably predicted at the outset wherein the cost risk will be shared. A firm target cost, target profit, and profit adjustment formula will be negotiated to provide a fair and reasonable incentive and a ceiling that provides for the contractor to assume an appropriate share of the risk.
 
T&M contracts provide for acquiring supplies or services on the basis of (1) direct labor hours at specified fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit; and (2) actual cost for materials. A customer may use this contract when it is not possible at the time of placing the contract to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.
 
Our OEM and Vendor Arrangements
 
We work with a number of manufacturers (“OEMs”) and vendors in our industry with a focus on commercial and federal enterprise markets, including, but not limited to Avnet (now combined with TechData), Synnex, Arrow. Carasoft, Idera, Dell, Panasonic, and Fujitsu. Avnet has historically been our most significant supplier by revenue; however, we intend to seek out additional quotes from other suppliers to obtain more competitive pricing.
 
Our vendor agreements vary, but typically, they permit us to purchase products for combining with integration and professional services for transactions with our customers. Very few of our agreements require us to purchase any specified quantity of product. We usually require our partners to provide us with supply and price protection for the duration of specifically signed contracts. Other than supply agreements under certain government contracts, our vendor agreements typically permit us or the vendor to terminate the agreement on short notice, at will or immediately upon default by either party, and may contain limitations on vendor liability. These vendor agreements also generally permit us to return previous product purchases within certain time limits for a restocking fee or in exchange for the vendor’s other products. Certain of our partners may also provide us with various forms of marketing and sales financial assistance, including sales incentives, market development funds, cooperative advertising and sales events. Partners may also provide sell-through and other sales incentives in connection with certain product promotions.


We depend on our vendors to provide us with financing on our purchases of inventory and services. Many of our suppliers have offered us net-30 or net-45 payment terms with credit limits ranging from $200,000 to up to $7 million, however, other vendors require that we prepay for our products and services. In 2016 and 2017, we did experience credit limitations imposed by vendors, which resulted in a significant disruption to our operation and access to merchandise. As a result of contributions by Inpixon provided following the completion of certain equity financings during the first quarter of 2018, we have been able to begin to improve our credit limitations through negotiated settlements plans with our vendors. Our vendors, however, could seek to limit the availability of vendor credit to us or modify the other terms under which they sell to us, or both, at any time, which could negatively affect our liquidity. We have ongoing discussions concerning our liquidity and financial position with the vendor community and third parties that offer various credit protection services to our vendors. The topics discussed have included such areas as pricing, payment terms and ongoing business arrangements. We also used a revolving credit facility to finance invoices in an amount equal to 80% of the face value of customer invoices, with the remaining 20%, net of fees paid upon collection of the customer receivable. We also used our revolving credit facility to finance 50% of the face value of purchase orders received to pre-pay vendors/suppliers to ensure shipment on our behalf to the end customer. Upon collection of the associated receivable from the customer, we then pay the remaining balance to our vendor/supplier and retain our profit.

Our Sales
 
In 2018, approximately 53%, or $2.1 million, of our total revenues were derived from product solutions sales and 47% or $1.8 million of our total revenues were derived from professional services sales. In 2017, approximately 81%, or $33.3 million, of our total revenues were derived from product solutions sales and 19%, or $7.8 million, of our total revenues were derived from professional services sales. Now with all industry trends showing an increase in spending and our supplier credit issues improving, we believe we will be able to regain previous clients and obtain new clients as spending increases and companies want to work closely with trusted providers.
Our Sales and Marketing Strategy
 
We currently market our products and services through direct marketing via sales representatives, tradeshows, government events and websites, vendor provided market development funds and other direct and indirect marketing activities to generate demand for our products and services. We also have extensive relationships with vendor/supplier partners to directly engage with customers.
 
In addition, we believe we have built a core competency in bidding on government requests for proposals in our infrastructure segment, comprising of the integration of hardware/software and professional services, by utilizing our internal bid and proposal team as well as consultants to prepare the proposal responses for government clients.
 
As part of our end-to-end IT solutions, we are authorized resellers of the products and services of leading IT manufacturers and distributors. In many cases, we have achieved the highest level of relationship the manufacturer or distributor offers. In addition, our employees hold certifications issued by these manufacturers and by industry associations relating to the configuration, installation and servicing of these products. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by the range of manufacturers and distributors we represent, the relationship level we have achieved with these manufacturers and distributors and the scope of the manufacturer and industry certifications our employees hold.
 
We have a variety of contracts that vary from cost plus to time and material in our storage and computing and professional services segments. These apply to both commercial and government customers.
 
Competition
 
We face substantial competition from other national, multi-regional, regional and local value-added resellers and IT service providers, some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do or that may have more fully developed business relationships with clients or prospective clients than we do. Many of our competitors compete principally on the basis of price and may have lower costs or accept lower selling prices than we do and, therefore, we may need to reduce our prices. In addition, manufacturers may choose to market their products directly to end-users, rather than through IT solutions providers such as us, and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
The U.S. government systems integration business is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete with a large number of systems integrators, hardware and software manufacturers, and other large and diverse companies attempting to enter or expand their presence in the U.S. government market. Many of the existing and potential competitors have greater financial, operating and technological resources than we have. The competitive environment may require us to make changes in our pricing, services or marketing. The competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks, including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us, or that may be awarded, but for which we do not receive meaningful revenues. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to develop services and products that address changing needs and to provide people and technology needed to deliver these services and products. In the government services sector our competition includes large systems integrators and defense contractors as well as small businesses such as 8a, women-owned, veteran disabled, Alaskan native, etc. Some of these competitors include global defense and IT service companies including IBM Global Services, LogicaCMG, CSC, ATOS Origins, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon IT Services and SAIC.

This complex landscape of domestic and multi-national services companies creates a challenging environment. To remain competitive, we must consistently provide superior service, technology and performance on a cost-effective basis to our customers. While we believe that, due to the functionality of our products, we can successfully compete in all of these markets, at this time we do not represent a significant presence in any of these markets.
 
Government Regulation
 
In general, we are subject to numerous federal, state and foreign legal requirements on matters as diverse as data privacy and protection, employment and labor relations, immigration, taxation, anticorruption, import/export controls, trade restrictions, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation and anti-competition.
 
Furthermore, U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government, department-specific regulations that implement or supplement DFAR, such as the Department of Defense’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (“DFARS”) and other applicable laws and regulations. We are also subject to the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations; the Procurement Integrity Act, which regulates access to competitor bid and proposal information and government source selection information, and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government officials; the Civil False Claims Act, which provides for substantial civil penalties for violations, including for submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government for payment or approval; and the U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. government contracts.
 
Violations of one or more of these diverse legal requirements in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines and other damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of customer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to compete for certain work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations. To date, compliance with these regulations has not been financially burdensome.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We currently do not have any registered patents, copyrights or trademarks. On August 31, 2018, we entered into a Trademark License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Sysorex Consulting, Inc. for use of the mark “Sysorex.” A. Salam Qureishi, Mr. Nadir Ali’s father-in-law and a member of his household, is the majority owner and the chief executive officer of Sysorex Consulting, Inc. The term of the License Agreement is perpetual. As consideration for the license, we issued 1,000,000 shares of our common stock to Sysorex Consulting, Inc. and have agreed to issue to Sysorex Consulting, Inc. 250,000 shares of our common stock on each anniversary of the agreement date until the License Agreement is terminated. The number of shares of common stock that will be issued in the future is subject to adjustment for changes in the outstanding shares of our common stock as a result of stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations, combinations or exchanges of shares, separations, reorganizations or liquidations. The License Agreement may be terminated as a result of a breach of the License Agreement by us that remains uncured; our bankruptcy; the discontinuance of our business or a change in our name so that the word “Sysorex” is no longer used in the name or on our products or services; the license is attached, assigned or transferred; or we experience a Change of Control, as defined in the License Agreement.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 21 employees, including two part-time employees. This includes two officers, six sales people, eight technical and engineering people and five finance and administration persons. Our employees are not subject to collective bargaining agreements.
Corporate Information
 
We were originally incorporated in California on January 3, 1994 under the name Lilien Systems. In connection with a reorganization of Inpixon effective as of January 1, 2016, Lilien Systems acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SGS and changed its name to Sysorex USA. On February 27, 2017, our name was changed to Inpixon USA. On July 26, 2018, solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Company into the State of Nevada, Inpixon formed a wholly owned subsidiary in the State of Nevada named “Sysorex, Inc.” which was merged with the Company and resulted in the Company being reincorporated in the state of Nevada under the name “Sysorex, Inc.” On August 31, 2018, Sysorex and Inpixon engaged in a spin-off transaction (the “Spin-off”), whereby Sysorex, and its wholly owned subsidiary SGS, was separated from Inpixon and became a separate entity with a separate management team and separate boards of directors, except that Nadir Ali, Chief Executive Officer and director of Inpixon also serves as a director of Sysorex. The address of our principal executive offices is 13880 Dulles Corner Lane, Suite 175, Herndon, Virginia 20171 and our telephone number at that location is (800) 929-3871.
