Item 1. Business
 When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “BRCC,” “Black Rifle Coffee,” “Black Rifle Coffee Company,” and the “Company” mean BRC Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively, unless the context requires otherwise. 
Company Overview
Black Rifle Coffee Company is a veteran-controlled company that through its subsidiaries serves premium coffee, content and merchandise to active military, veterans, first responders, and those who love America. Our mission-driven brand is devoted to cause-related content that informs, inspires, entertains, and builds our community. We are committed to producing great coffee that consumers love, and high-quality merchandise that enables our community to showcase our brand. By consistently delivering exceptional products and content, we have built and retained a strong following of loyal customers throughout the United States. 
We utilize a three-pronged approach to craft a unique brand that resonates with our customer base and enhances brand loyalty: Inform, Inspire, and Entertain. We want our audience to love coffee as much as we do, so we strive to inform them on all the awesome facets to coffee. Every day we work to inspire our customers; we take pride in the coffee we roast, the veterans we employ and the causes we support. We give back to the community and are committed to support those who serve. Our “Entertain” marketing strategy drives brand excitement, along with valuable customer insights and data. 
We own two roasting facilities, one focused on large batch roasting and the other on small batch roasting. The coffee beans are primarily roasted in-house in the United States to ensure consistency and quality of product. Our coffee beans have an 83-point grade or higher and are sourced only from high quality suppliers. Our owned roasting facilities offer significant capacity for expansion and allow us to provide our customers with a fresh product. 
We have experienced strong revenue growth since inception. Revenue increased to $301.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $233.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and from $163.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing growth of 29.3% and 42.2% respectively. Growth in 2022 was primarily driven by expansion of our customer base, increasing Wholesale doors, and new Outpost openings. Our Ready-To-Drink line continues to be the fastest growing single serve RTD coffee across all channels of trade. Our entry into the Food, Drug and Mass (“FDM”) market in collaboration with Walmart unlocks significant incremental opportunity to build brand awareness and ensures customers can purchase our products in more places where they shop. We expect our entry into the FDM market will contribute significant incremental growth, revenue and brand awareness.
We are a digitally native brand that operates as one reportable segment. Our omnichannel distribution strategy has three key components: Direct to Consumer, Wholesale, and Outposts. Our DTC channel includes our e-commerce business, through which consumers order our products online and products are shipped to them. Our Wholesale channel includes products sold to an intermediary such as convenience, grocery, drug, and mass merchandise stores, who in turn sell those products to consumers. Wholesale channel sales comprise a broad array of our products, including our roasted bagged coffees and k-cups, our merchandise, and our RTD products. Our Wholesale customers include the FDM customer set, such as Walmart; specialty retail, such as Bass Pro; and convenience stores which primarily sell our RTD products, such as 7-Eleven. Our Outpost channel includes revenue from our Company-operated and franchised Black Rifle Coffee retail coffee shop locations. Revenue is driven primarily by our DTC channel which contributed to approximately 52.8%, 70.9% and 84.0% of our total revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 To meet the increasing popularity of our RTD, rounds, and bagged coffee, we rely on co-manufacturers to provide us with a portion of our production capacity. Maintaining these relationships enable us to quickly scale the production of our products to meet consumer demands. 
We have also expanded our Wholesale channel by adding a number of partnership programs, including partnerships with social media influencers and sports teams. Select influencers who partner with us to promote our products are awarded equity in our Company. In July, 2022, we announced a partnership with the Dallas Cowboys that includes product placement at AT&T Stadium.
Our Mission and Community
Our mission at BRCC is to serve premium coffee and content to active military, veterans, first responders, and those who love America. Our company began with a simple premise — to provide a quality product while giving back to the

veteran, active military, and first responder communities through direct hiring, inspiring stories told through our media channels and charitable donations. As a business founded and led by combat veterans of the Global War on Terror, we are mission-driven: everything we do, every decision we make, is in service of our mission. 
It begins with our people. At Black Rifle Coffee, our goal is to hire veterans and be the employer of choice for individuals seeking a post-military career. We aim to not just hire veterans, but also inspire veterans to become entrepreneurs and highlight for other businesses the benefits of hiring veterans. Today, veterans and veteran spouses comprise approximately half of our total employee base of over 900 people, including part-time and seasonal workers. 
Black Rifle Coffee donated over $1.6 million of coffee to military and first responder units and through our affiliated 501(c)(3) non profit corporation, (“BRCC Fund”), we donated over $1.8 million in other donations to charitable organizations in 2022. Additionally, certain legacy holders of SilverBox Engaged Merger Corp I, a Delaware corporation ("SilverBox") and Authentic Brands, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company through which the Company conducts its business donated over 530,000 shares of Class A Common Stock to the BRCC Fund in 2022. The BRCC Fund focuses on veteran-related causes important to the Company, including education and job training for veterans and scholarships for family members of veterans killed or wounded in action. 
Our mission-driven approach and brand values resonate with our consumers and allowed us to build a growing Black Rifle Coffee community. According to a Company survey, the top three reasons that customers purchase from Black Rifle Coffee are due to our support for the military and veterans, our great tasting coffee, and our brand’s alignment with their values. Our community is broad and reaches a diverse audience across geographies and demographics. 
Our Business
BRCC is a rapidly growing, veteran-controlled and led coffee and media company with a loyal and quickly expanding community of more than 2 million consumers through our DTC channel since inception, more than 270,000 active Coffee Club subscribers, and 13.1 million social media followers across Black Rifle Coffee’s, co-founders’, and key media personalities’ accounts as of December 31, 2022. Evan Hafer founded the Company in 2014 with a one-pound roaster in his garage, roasting, packaging, and shipping bagged coffee direct to consumers. 
Today, Black Rifle Coffee operates out of facilities and offices in Salt Lake City, Utah; Manchester, Tennessee; and San Antonio, Texas, and offers over 20 varieties of roasted whole bean and ground coffee, plus our RTD, single-serve, and instant coffee. Our historical performance reflects the scale and growth of our Company. 
At Black Rifle Coffee, we develop our roast profiles with the same mission focus we learned as military members serving our country. We produce creative and engaging, cause-related media content, in-house produced podcasts, and digital and print journalism in-house to inform, inspire, entertain, and build our community. We also sell Black Rifle Coffee-brand apparel, coffee brewing equipment, and outdoor and lifestyle gear that our consumers proudly wear and use to showcase our brand. Merchandise and equipment sales as a percentage of revenue accounted for approximately 9.0% of DTC revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Our DTC platform has been the core of our business from day one starting with www.blackriflecoffee.com. It has enabled us to quickly become a large, recognizable, and fast-growing beverage brand in the United States, while also allowing us to better understand our consumers and their preferences. 
We offer a subscription service, our Coffee Club, through which DTC consumers can receive ground, whole bean, single serve, instant, or RTD coffee shipped to their home or office as frequently as every fourteen days. As of December 31, 2022, our Coffee Club subscribers have grown to 270,000 over the past five years. We also sell coffee, apparel, and gear online for individual purchase on a non-subscription basis. Our DTC channel generated $159.0 million of sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $165.3 million over the corresponding period in 2021, representing a decrease of 3.8%. More than 72% of our 2022 DTC channel revenue came from recurring subscriptions. 
Our Wholesale channel complements our DTC sales. In our Wholesale channel, we sell coffee, apparel, and gear through leading outdoor, DIY, and lifestyle retailers, including Bass Pro Shops, Scheels, and Ace Hardware, as well as specialty retailers. We also sell RTD coffee in leading convenience, grocery, FDM merchandise retailers, including Casey’s General Store, Circle K, Kum & Go, Speedway, 7-Eleven, Publix, HEB, Walmart, and Sam’s Club. Our Wholesale channel generated $119.4 million of sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $55.8 million over the corresponding period in 2021, representing an increase of 114.1%. 
We also operate and franchise Outposts. We believe our Outposts redefine the typical coffee shop experience, offering consumers an immersive environment in which to enjoy a freshly brewed cup of high-quality coffee, stock up on Black Rifle Coffee merchandise and bagged coffee, and connect with members of the local community. We opened our first

Company-operated Outpost in 2020 in San Antonio, Texas. We are in the early stages of our nationwide growth, with twenty-six Outposts, of which fifteen were company-operated and eleven were franchised open across eight states, including Texas, Utah, Arizona, Tennessee, Georgia, Oklahoma, Florida and Virginia as of December 31, 2022. Our Outpost channel generated $22.9 million of sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $12.0 million over the corresponding period in 2021 representing an increase of 90.5%. 
Product Supply
The majority of our green coffee beans come from Colombia, Nicaragua, and Brazil, but since 2020, we have also sourced green coffee beans from over ten countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia to diversify our supply chain and offer our customers specialty and limited-time-only roasts. Quality control is also a critically important part of our manufacturing and supply chain operations. 68% of our bagged roasted coffee is roasted in-house and 100% is roasted in the United States. A licensed, Coffee Quality Institute-certified grader and former Green Beret leads cupping, grading, scoring, and sourcing of our coffees.
Competition
We are uniquely positioned to compete in the $45.0 billion coffee market across our at-home, RTD, and out-of-home coffee products and channels and against other high-growth consumer businesses. Competition in our markets is based on factors such as product quality, roasting methods, brand recognition, and technology. We believe that we have been able to compete successfully on the basis of our superior product, powerful media platform, emphasis on a mission-led lifestyle, a loyal customer base, and scalable omnichannel strategy with a strong subscriber base. We roast the majority of our coffee beans in-house, and we consider our roasting methods essential to the quality of our products. We believe that we serve a more attractive customer base than the broader coffee market, as our customers are more engaged with our brand. Our customers consistently buy our branded merchandise in addition to coffee, proudly wear Black Rifle Coffee apparel, display Black Rifle Coffee banners and decals and proactively recommend us to their friends, family, and others through social media and by word-of-mouth. We believe the emotional connection and brand advocacy of our consumers helps fuel our growth and grants us the opportunity to expand our product offering. 
In the RTD category we compete against established, well-known brands like Monster, private-label brands like Orinoco, and high-growth food and beverage companies such as Celsius. The RTD and retort dairy businesses are highly competitive, with high barriers to entry, such as production and distribution.
In the out-of-home coffee category we compete against both well-known brands and also small local coffee shops. Longer-established out-of-home coffee competitors may have greater brand recognition, and have substantially greater financial, technological, roasting, sale, distribution, and other resources. However, our entry into the FDM market unlocks significant incremental opportunity to build brand awareness and ensures customers can purchase our products in more places where they shop. Our customers spend more than the typical coffee buyer on a per-purchase basis due to merchandise and bagged coffee sales. This drives an attractive average order value of approximately $12 to $13 at our Outposts.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations. The first quarter typically will experience lower revenues. In our DTC and Outpost revenue channels, we tend to have higher revenues and cash flow during the holiday season in the fourth quarter. Results for any quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results for a full fiscal year. 
Human Capital
We have built a strong and cohesive culture centered around our mission of serving coffee and content to active military, veterans, first responders, and those who love America. We are veteran-controlled, and approximately 50% of our employees are veterans or veteran spouses. Our goal is to maintain our current level of veteran hires as we expand our operations and further develop our Outpost model.
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 918 employees across locations in the United States. Of the 918 employees, 68 are focused on production, 479 are in marketing, operations or other administrative roles, and 371 are in roles at Outposts. In addition, we employ part-time and seasonal workers. We will continue to focus on hiring veterans and training our employees to provide the authentic Black Rifle Coffee Company experience in our Outpost locations.
Employee Wellness
Table of Contents

We promote health, wellness, and safety through a variety of means which include, but are not limited to, onsite employee training modules, external support such as employee assistance programs and crisis counseling, and universal escalation procedures as it pertains to safety protocols.
Employee Development and Training
We believe that employee development and training is a shared relationship between the employee, their leadership team, and their HR business partner. As this is typically not a one-size fits all approach, training and development plans are unique to the employee and their overall business unit. 
Total Rewards Package
Our Total Rewards Package is comprehensive in the fact that it addresses each milestone of the employee life cycle. Those rewards include but are not limited to medical, dental, vision, and voluntary coverages, as well as a variety of compensation rewards. 
Intellectual Property
We own many registered trademarks and service marks in the United States, including the trademark for “Black Rifle Coffee Company,” and our word marks have been registered in multiple classes of goods and services. We own a more limited subset of registered trademarks in jurisdictions outside the United States. Our most important trademark might be our “BRCC” logo, which immediately identifies the brand. We believe that the Black Rifle Coffee Company name and all of its associated marks are of significant value and importance to our business. As a general policy, we pursue registration and monitor the use of our marks in the United States and challenge any unauthorized use.
We license the use of our marks to franchise partners, third-party vendors, and others through franchise agreements, vendor agreements, and licensing agreements. These agreements typically restrict third parties’ activities with respect to use of the marks and impose brand standards requirements. We require licensees to inform us of any potential infringement of the marks.
We register some of our copyrighted material and otherwise rely on common law protection of our copyrighted works. Such copyrighted materials are not material to our business.
Government Regulations
We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local government regulation, including those relating to, among others, public health and safety, nutritional content labeling and disclosure requirements, food safety regulations, zoning and fire codes, and franchising. Failure to obtain or retain licenses and registrations or exemptions would adversely affect the operation of our Outposts and other properties. Although we have not experienced and do not anticipate experiencing any significant problems obtaining required licenses, permits, or approvals, any difficulties, delays, or failures in obtaining such licenses, permits, registrations, exemptions, or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, an Outpost shop in a particular area. The development and construction of additional Outposts will be subject to compliance with the applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations.
Our franchising activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC’s franchise rules and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document (“FDD”) containing certain financial information to prospective franchise partners in a number of states. Additionally, certain states require registration of the FDD with state authorities. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchise or franchise relationship exist in a substantial number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise, and the ability of a franchise partner to designate sources of supply. We believe our FDD complies in all material aspects with both the FTC franchise rules and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have franchises.
We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and various federal and state laws governing such matters such as minimum wage, overtime, employment tax rates, workers compensation rates, citizenship requirements, and other working conditions. A significant number of our personnel are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage. We are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of a disability and public accommodations in employment, which may require us to design or modify our facilities to make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons.

See Item 1A. Risk Factors. Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation for further information.
Environmental
We believe federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on operations, but more stringent and varied requirements of local government bodies with respect to zoning land use and environmental factors could delay construction and increase development costs for new facilities.
Business Combination and Organizational Structure
On February 9, 2022, we consummated a business combination (the “Business Combination”) by which BRC Inc. became the parent company of Authentic Brands, pursuant to a business combination agreement dated November 21, 2021 and amended January 4, 2022 (the “Business Combination Agreement”). Authentic Brands is the direct parent of Black Rifle Coffee Company, a Delaware limited liability company (“BRCC LLC”).
Following the completion of the Business Combination, our organizational structure is what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership C corporation (or Up-C) structure. This organizational structure allows certain owners of Authentic Brands to retain their equity ownership in Authentic Brands, an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the form of Common Units and Restricted Units of Authentic Brands. Each continuing owner of Authentic Brands also holds a number of shares of Class B Common Stock in the Company equal to the number of Common Units held by such owner, which have no economic value, but which entitles the holder thereof to one vote per share at any meeting of our shareholders.
