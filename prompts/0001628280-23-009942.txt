ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
Overview
Sonida Senior Living, Inc., (formerly known as Capital Senior Living Corporation), a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries, "we," "us," "our," or "the Company"), is one of the leading owner-operators of senior housing communities in the United States in terms of resident capacity. The Company and its predecessors have provided senior housing since 1990. As of December 31, 2022, the Company operated 72 senior housing communities in 18 states with an aggregate capacity of approximately 8,000 residents, including 62 senior housing communities that the Company owned and 10 communities that the Company third-party managed. 
We generally provide residential housing and services to people aged 75 years and older, including independent living, assisted living, and memory care services. Many of our communities offer a continuum of care to meet our residents’ needs as they change over time by integrating independent living, assisted living, and memory care, which may be bridged by home care through independent home care agencies. Our integrated approach sustains residents’ autonomy and independence based on their physical and cognitive abilities.
Strategy
Our mission is to bring quality senior living to life. We provide comfortable, safe, affordable communities where residents can form friendships, enjoy new experiences, and receive personalized care from team members who treat them like family, while also striving to (i) achieve and sustain a strong, competitive position within our geographically concentrated regions, and (ii) continue to enhance the performance of our operations. Our strategic priorities are designed to enhance our performance and position our portfolio for near- and long-term growth.  
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we introduced a new management plan focused on a number of strategic priorities that are core to the Company's refreshed mission. By executing on these priorities, we aim to continue our growth and margin expansion and to enhance our market position as a leading owner-operator of senior housing communities in the United States. The following strategic priorities are intended to complement and enhance our core operational efforts while addressing the Company's financial position and increasing margin penetration against the backdrop of rapidly evolving demographic, economic and regulatory environments.
Operational Excellence. We strive to remove inefficiencies and improve quality in our operations to reinvest in the Company by focusing on:
•Rate optimization 
•Marketing initiatives to maintain post-COVID occupancy recovery
•Group Purchasing Program ("GPO") enhancements and compliance
•Improving liquidity through better collections and cash management
Value. Our living environment and team members deliver value to our residents and strive to exceed their expectations by improving:
•Resident satisfaction
•Reputation score
•Services and programming
•Health and safety
Team. Strong local leadership teams develop engaged, loyal and caring team members by focusing on:
•Employee engagement
•Community leadership team retention
•Labor management and cost control
•Contract labor reduction
As discussed below, in November 2021, we raised approximately $154.8 million from investors, which allowed us to make strategic investments in our portfolio and to position us for further growth. Over the past year we also made significant capital expenditures in our communities, including overall refreshes and technological improvements, to enhance our residents' experience and to drive future growth. 
We strive to create commercial distinction where our brand presence is synonymous with excellence.  Our sales team is focused on customer engagement and performance-based media strategies. Our marketing activities focus on increasing the volume of leading indicators, including new resident inquiries and tours, so that potential residents and their families can effectively evaluate our portfolio of services.  
Our overall strategy is focused on organic growth through existing community advancement as well as growth through acquisitions. We continue to be positioned to provide competitive residential rates and flexible product offerings.  Our portfolio is situated in markets where positive demographic trends exist with respect to population growth, income growth, and increased chronic medical conditions relative to the 75+ age group.  
Recent Developments
2022 Mortgage Refinance
In March 2022, the Company completed the refinancing of certain existing mortgage debt with Ally Bank (the “Refinance Facility”) for ten of its communities. The Refinance Facility includes an initial term loan of $80 million. In addition, $10 million is available as delayed loans that can be borrowed upon achieving and maintaining certain financial covenant requirements, and up to an additional uncommitted $40 million may be available in the lender's discretion to fund future growth initiatives. On December 13, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Ally Bank to amend the Refinance Facility by adding two additional subsidiaries of the Company (which own the two Indiana properties acquired during the first quarter of 2022) as borrowers. The amendment increased the principal by $8.1 million to $88.1 million, with an additional $10 million still available as delayed loans that can be borrowed upon achieving and maintaining certain financial covenant requirements. See "Note 8 - Notes Payable" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Management Transition
As previously announced in the Form 8-K filed by the Company on August 5, 2022, Kimberly S. Lody notified the Company on August 2, 2022 that she was resigning as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board of Directors (the “Board”), effective September 2, 2022. In accordance with the Company’s succession plan, on August 2, 2022, the Board appointed Brandon M. Ribar, the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and as a member of the Board, effective September 2, 2022.
Indiana Acquisition
On February 1, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of two senior living communities located in Indiana for a combined purchase price of $12.3 million. The communities consist of a total of 157 independent living units. The purchase price for these communities was funded at the time of acquisition with cash on hand and subsequently financed in December 2022, as described in the "2022 Mortgage Refinance" paragraph above.
Corporate Name Change
On November 9, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, with the Delaware Secretary of State to effect the change of the Company’s name from "Capital Senior Living Corporation" to “Sonida Senior Living, Inc.” effective as of November 15, 2021 (the “Name Change”). In addition, the Company’s board of directors adopted an amendment to the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Bylaws to reflect the Company’s new legal name, effective as of November 15, 2021. 
In conjunction with the Name Change, the ticker symbol of the Company’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange changed from "CSU" to “SNDA.” The CUSIP number for the Company’s common stock following the effectiveness of the Name Change remained unchanged.
Investment Agreement
On October 1, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Investment Agreement (the "A&R Investment Agreement") with Conversant Dallas Parkway (A) LP (“Conversant Fund A”) and Conversant Dallas Parkway (B) LP ("Conversant Fund B" and, together with Conversant Fund A, the “Conversant Investors”), affiliates of Conversant Capital LLC, which amended and restated in its entirety the Investment Agreement that the Company entered into with the Conversant Investors on July 22, 2021 (the “Original Investment Agreement”). Pursuant to the A&R Investment Agreement, (i) the Conversant Investors purchased from the Company, and the Company sold to the Conversant Investors, in a private placement (the “Private Placement”) pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), 41,250 shares of newly designated Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), at a 
price per share equal to $1,000; and 1,650,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a price per share equal to $25; (ii) the Conversant Investors received 1,031,250 warrants, each evidencing the right to purchase one share of common stock at a price per share of $40 and with an exercise expiration date of five years after the Closing Date; (iii) the Company amended the terms of its previously announced rights offering under the Original Investment Agreement to allow the holders of record of its outstanding shares of common stock at the close of business on September 10, 2021 the right to purchase at $30 per share, 1.1 shares of common stock for each share of common stock held (the “Rights Offering”), in each case as more fully described in the A&R Investment Agreement. On or after the closing date under the A&R Investment Agreement, the Company may from time to time request additional investments from the Conversant Investors in shares of Series A Preferred Stock for investment in accretive capital expenditures and acquisitions post-closing up to an aggregate amount equal to $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions. 
In addition, pursuant to the A&R Investment Agreement, the Conversant Investors agreed to partially backstop the Amended Rights Offering up to $50.5 million through the purchase of additional shares of the Company's common stock at $30 per share. In consideration for the backstop commitments of the Conversant Investors, the Company paid the Conversant Investors, as a premium, 174,675 shares of common stock.
Simultaneously with the entry into the Original Investment Agreement, the Company and the Conversant Investors entered into a $17.3 million secured promissory note (the “Promissory Note”) to provide interim debt financing which was scheduled to mature in July 2022. The Promissory Note was amended to reduce the aggregate indebtedness outstanding by $1.3 million, resulting in an amended secured promissory note in the amount of $16.0 million. The Promissory Note was fully repaid upon closing of the transactions contemplated by the A&R Investment Agreement and the Company recognized a $1.0 million loss on extinguishment of the Promissory Note. See "Note 8- Notes Payable" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The transactions contemplated by the A&R Investment Agreement were subject to stockholder approval, which was received on October 22, 2021. The Rights Offering expired on October 27, 2021 with subscription rights to purchase 1,133,941 shares exercised. The transactions contemplated by the A&R Investment Agreement closed (the “Closing”) on November 3, 2021 and resulted in net proceeds to the Company of $141.4 million after paying customary transaction and closing costs of approximately $13.4 million. The Conversant Investors and Arbiter Partners QP, LP (“Arbiter”) backstopped the Rights Offering, pursuant to which they purchased an additional 1,160,806 shares of common stock and 114,911 shares of common stock, respectively, and received a backstop fee of 174,675 shares of common stock and 17,292 shares of common stock, respectively.
At the Closing, the Company, the Conversant Investors and Silk Partners LP (“Silk”) entered into an Investor Rights Agreement (the "Investor Rights Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, the Company's board of directors was reconstituted to consist of four new directors designated by the Conversant Investors, two new directors designated by Silk and three continuing directors.
At the Closing, all outstanding performance-based stock based compensation held by the Company's officers and other key employees, including restricted shares, were converted at target award levels to time-based restricted stock awards that are scheduled vest on the applicable scheduled vesting dates or the relevant award termination date applicable to such performance shares. See “Note 10- Stock-Based Compensation” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
COVID-19 Pandemic Update
The United States broadly continues to recover from the pandemic caused by COVID-19, which significantly disrupted the nation’s economy, the senior living industry and the Company’s business. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a decline in the occupancy levels at the Company’s communities, which has negatively impacted the Company’s revenues and operating results, which depend significantly on such occupancy levels.  In an effort to protect its residents and employees and slow the spread of COVID-19 and in response to quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and other limitations imposed by federal, state and local governments, the Company had previously restricted or limited access to its communities, including limitations on in-person prospective resident tours and, in certain cases, new resident admissions. As of December 31, 2022, all of the Company's senior living communities were open for new resident move-ins. Although vaccines are now widely available, we cannot predict the severity of ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business. If the situation surrounding the spread of COVID-19 worsens, including the risk of transmission of highly contagious variants of the COVID-19 virus, the Company may have to impose or revert to restricted or limited access to its communities.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we were also successful in the early procurement of personal protective equipment (“PPE”) and sterilization supplies, which enabled us to set up quick-access supply hubs to support our geographical regions.  We responded with real-time operational adjustments to support a consistent resident service model, despite the rapidly changing and challenging senior living environment.
During 2022 and 2021, we incurred significant additional operating costs and expenses in order to implement enhanced infection control protocols and enhanced care for our residents. For example, we incurred substantial costs for procurement of additional PPE, cleaning and disposable food service supplies, enhanced cleaning, infection control, environmental sanitation costs, and increased labor expenses for hazard pay and contract labor at certain communities with COVID-19 positive residents. We also incurred costs related to COVID-19 testing of our residents and our employees. In total, we incurred approximately $0.4 million and $1.9 million in incremental COVID-19 costs in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect to continue to incur such incremental costs until the COVID-19 pandemic significantly subsides.
In April 2022 and January 2021, the Company accepted $9.1 million and $8.7 million of cash, respectively, through grants from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund’s (the “Provider Relief Fund”) Phases 4 and 3 General Distribution, respectively, which was expanded by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the “CARES Act”) to provide grants or other funding mechanisms to eligible healthcare providers for healthcare-related expenses or lost revenues attributable to COVID-19. Both the Phase 4 and Phase 3 Provider Relief Funds were recorded as other income in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The CARES Act Provider Relief Funds are grants that do not have to be repaid provided we satisfy the terms and conditions of the CARES Act. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company received approximately $1.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in relief from various state agencies.
CARES Act Provider Relief Funds are subject to the terms and conditions of the program, including stringent restrictions that funds may only be used to reimburse COVID-19 related expenses or lost revenue that are attributable to COVID-19 and have not been reimbursed from other sources or that other sources are not obligated to reimburse. While we intend to pursue additional funding that may become available, there can be no assurances that we will qualify for, or receive, any additional relief funds in the future.
The Company elected to utilize the CARES Act payroll tax deferral program to delay payment of a portion of its payroll taxes incurred from April 2020 through December 2020. The Company repaid one-half of the deferral amount in December 2021 and the other half became due on December 31, 2022. The Company has submitted applications to enter into payment plans for the remaining amounts due. In conjunction with the deferral and payment plan applications, the Company accrued penalties and interest of $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, which were included in accrued expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had $4.8 million and $3.7 million, respectively, in deferred payroll taxes, which is included in accrued expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Going Concern Uncertainty and Related Strategic and Cash-Preservation Initiatives
As noted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, due to the current inflationary environment, elevated interest rates, and continued impact of COVID-19 on our financial position, as well as our upcoming debt maturities, our management concluded as of December 31, 2022 that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have implemented plans, which include strategic and cash-preservation initiatives designed to provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our obligations for at least the 12-month period following the date our fiscal year 2022 financial statements are issued. See “Note 2–Going Concern Uncertainty and Related Strategic and Cash-Preservation Initiatives” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We have taken, and continue to take, actions to improve our liquidity position and to address the uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern, but these actions are subject to a number of assumptions, projections, and analyses. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, we may be unsuccessful in executing our business plans or achieving the projected results, which could adversely impact our financial results and liquidity. Those plans include various cost-cutting, efficiency and profitability initiatives. There are no assurances such initiatives will prove to be successful or the cost savings, profitability or other results we achieve through those plans will be consistent with our expectations. As a result, our results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively impacted. In particular, if we are unable to extend or refinance our indebtedness prior to scheduled maturity dates, our liquidity and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Even if we are able to extend or refinance such indebtedness, the terms of the new financing may not be as favorable to us as the terms of the existing financing. If we become insolvent or fail to continue as a going concern, our common stock may become worthless.
Industry Background
The senior living industry encompasses a broad and diverse range of living accommodations and supportive services that are provided primarily to persons 75 years of age or older.
For seniors who require limited services, independent living residences, supplemented at times by home health care, offers a viable option. Most independent living communities typically offer community living packaged with basic services consisting of meals, housekeeping, laundry, 24-hour staffing, transportation, social and recreational activities and health care monitoring. Independent living residents typically are not reliant on assistance with activities of daily living (“ADLs”), although some residents may utilize outside vendors for those services.
As a senior’s need for assistance increases, care in an assisted living residence is often preferable and more cost-effective than home-based care or nursing home care. Typically, assisted living represents a combination of housing and support services designed to aid residents with ADLs such as ambulation, bathing, dressing, eating, grooming, personal hygiene and monitoring or assistance with medications. Certain assisted living communities may also provide assistance to residents with low acuity medical needs.  Others may offer higher levels of personal assistance for residents with chronic diseases and conditions or memory care services for residents with Alzheimer’s disease or other cognitive frailties. Generally, assisted living residents require higher levels of care than residents of independent living residences but require lower levels of care than residents in skilled nursing facilities. For seniors who need the constant attention of a skilled nurse or medical practitioner, a skilled nursing facility may be required.
The senior living industry is highly fragmented and characterized by numerous small operators. Moreover, the scope of senior living services varies substantially from one operator to another. Many smaller senior living providers do not operate purpose-built residences, do not have extensive professional training for staff and provide only limited assistance with ADLs. We believe that, as one of the nation’s leading owner-operators, we have the scale and resources needed to provide the required comprehensive range of senior living services designed to permit our residents to “age in place” within our communities as residents develop further physical or cognitive frailties, whereas smaller providers do not.
We believe that a number of demographic, regulatory and other trends will contribute to the continued growth in the senior living market, including the following:
Consumer Preference
We believe that senior housing communities are the setting preferred by many prospective residents and their families for the care of the senior population. Senior living offers residents greater independence and allows them to “age in place” in a residential setting, which we believe results in a higher quality of life than that experienced in more institutional or clinical settings.
The likelihood of living alone increases with age. Most of this increase is due to an aging population in which women outlive men. Societal changes, such as high divorce rates and the growing numbers of persons choosing not to marry, have further increased the number of Americans living alone. This growth in the number of seniors living alone has resulted in an increased demand for services that historically have been provided by a spouse, other family members or live-in caregivers.
Demographics
Our portfolio is strategically positioned in (i) attractive, high-growth middle income demographic geographies and (ii) regions where the number of new senior living units needed will continue to grow as a result of the projected increase in the number of chronic conditions in the senior population.
Senior Affluence
The average net worth of senior citizens is typically higher than non-senior citizens, partially as a result of accumulated equity through home ownership. We believe that a substantial portion of the senior population has historically accumulated significant resources available for their retirement and long-term care needs. Our target population is comprised of middle market seniors who have, either directly or indirectly through familial support, the financial resources to afford and pay for senior housing communities, including an assisted living alternative to traditional long-term care.
Reduced Reliance on Family Care
Historically, the family has been the primary provider of care for seniors. We believe that a reduction in the availability of family caregivers, the reduction of average family size, and overall increased mobility in society is reducing the role of the family as the traditional and primary caregiver for aging parents. We believe that these factors will make it necessary for many seniors to look outside the family for assistance as they age.
Restricted Supply of Nursing Beds
Several states in the United States have adopted Certificate of Need or similar statutes generally requiring that, prior to the addition of new skilled nursing beds, the addition of new services, or the making of certain capital expenditures, a state agency must determine that a need exists for the new beds or the proposed activities. We believe that this process tends to restrict the supply and availability of licensed nursing facility beds. High construction costs, limitations on government reimbursement and start-up expenses also act to constrain growth in the supply of such facilities. At the same time, nursing facility operators are continuing to focus on improving occupancy and expanding services to sub-acute patients generally of a 
younger age and requiring significantly higher levels of nursing care. As a result, we believe that there has been a decrease in the number of skilled nursing beds available to patients with lower acuity levels and that this trend should increase the demand for our senior housing communities, including our assisted living and memory care communities.
Cost-Containment Pressures
In response to rapidly rising health care costs, governmental and private pay sources have adopted cost containment measures that have reduced admissions and encouraged reduced lengths of stays in hospitals and other acute care settings. Private insurers have begun to limit reimbursement for medical services in general to predetermined charges, and managed care organizations (such as health maintenance organizations) are attempting to limit hospitalization costs by negotiating for discounted rates for hospital and acute care services and by monitoring and reducing hospital use. In response, hospitals are discharging patients earlier and referring aging patients, who may be too sick or frail to manage their lives without assistance, to nursing homes and assisted living residences where the cost of providing care is typically lower than hospital care. In addition, third-party payors are increasingly becoming involved in determining the appropriate health care settings for their insureds or clients, based primarily on cost and quality of care. 
Senior Living Services
We provide senior living services to residents aged 75 and greater, including independent living, assisted living, and memory care services. By offering a variety of services and encouraging the active participation of each resident and such resident’s family and medical professionals, we are able to customize our service plan to meet the specific needs and desires of each resident. As a result, we believe that we are able to maximize customer satisfaction and avoid the cost of delivering unnecessary services to residents.
Our operating philosophy is to provide quality senior housing communities and services to senior citizens and deliver a continuum of care for our residents as their needs change over time in coordination with third party post-acute care providers. This continuum of care, which integrates independent living, assisted living, and memory care services sustains our residents' autonomy and independence based on their physical and mental abilities. In many of our communities, as residents age, they are able to obtain the additional services they need within the same community, avoiding the disruptive and often traumatic move to a different facility.
Our lease agreements with our residents are generally for a term of one year and, under certain circumstances, are typically terminable by us or the resident upon providing 30 days’ notice, unless state law stipulates otherwise.
Independent Living Services
We provide independent living services to seniors who typically do not yet need assistance or support with ADLs, but who prefer the physical and psychological comfort of a residential community that offers health care and other services. Independent living services provided by us include daily meals, transportation, social and recreational activities, laundry, housekeeping and 24-hour staffing. We also foster the wellness of our residents by offering access to health screenings (such as blood pressure checks), periodic special services (such as COVID-19 and influenza inoculations), dietary and similar programs, and ongoing exercise and fitness classes. Classes are given by health care professionals to keep residents informed about health and disease management. Subject to applicable governmental regulations, personal care and medical services are available to independent living residents through either the community staff or through independent home care agencies. 
Assisted Living Services
We offer a wide range of assisted living care and services, including personal care services, 24-hour staffing, support services, and other supplemental services, including memory care services at some communities (as described below). The residents at our assisted living residences generally need help with some or all ADLs, but do not require the more acute medical care traditionally provided in nursing homes. Upon admission to our assisted living communities, and in consultation with the resident, the resident’s family and medical consultants, each resident is assessed to determine his or her health status, including functional abilities and need for personal care services. The resident also completes a lifestyle assessment to determine the resident’s preferences. From these assessments, a care plan is developed for each resident so that all staff members who render care can meet the specific needs and preferences of each resident, where possible. Each resident’s individual care plan is reviewed periodically to determine whether a change in the level of care is needed.
We have adopted a philosophy of assisted living care that allows a resident to maintain a dignified independent lifestyle. Residents and their families are encouraged to be partners in the residents’ care and to take as much responsibility for their well-being as possible. The basic types of assisted living services offered by us include:
Personal Care Services.     These services include assistance with ADLs such as ambulation, bathing, dressing, eating, grooming, personal hygiene, and monitoring or assistance with medications.
Support Services.     These services include meals, assistance with social and recreational activities, laundry services, general housekeeping, maintenance services and transportation services.
Supplemental Services.     These services include extra transportation services, personal maintenance, extra laundry services and special care services, such as services for residents with certain forms of dementia. Certain of these services require extra charges.
Memory Care Services
We maintain programs and special living accommodations at some of our communities for residents with certain forms of dementia, which provide the attention, care and services needed to help these residents maintain a higher quality of life. Specialized services include assistance with ADLs, behavior management, and life skills-based activities programs, the goal of which is to provide a normalized environment that supports the resident’s remaining functional abilities. Special living accommodations for residents with certain forms of dementia are located in a separate area of the community with its own dining facilities, resident lounge areas, and specially trained staff. The special care areas are designed to allow residents the freedom to ambulate as they wish, while keeping them within a secure area with a minimum amount of disruption from other residents. Resident fees for these programs and special living accommodations are dependent on the level of services provided.
In January 2021, we announced our new memory care program, Magnolia Trails, which was developed to meet the growing need for individualized programming for residents receiving memory care services. The program is designed to engage the five senses to create calming yet stimulating spaces and tailored care plans that seek to address our residents’ changing and evolving needs. Each resident’s preferences and current cognitive state influences his or her experience, including, the physical layout and design of the space, dining options, programs, and activities. Aspects of the program include playing light background music that aligns with the generation living in the community, caregivers wearing business casual shirts and khakis rather than uniforms or scrubs, and our team members sharing items with residents in order to spark positive memories of family members or past experiences. The same responsive, sensory-focused approach is taken with dining. A dynamic menu of options is served throughout the day in a flexible but consistent manner. Our staff members provide warm, scented washcloths before each meal and incorporate inviting, calming aromas, and soft music to enhance the ambiance.
Because Magnolia Trails is focused on the best way to engage each individual resident, employees learn about and incorporate each resident’s personal history and interests into his or her ongoing daily interactions. Comforting, hands-on activities are available, such as flower arranging, puzzles, and matching games. Interactive experience stations, such as pet care, gardening, and tool benches are also available.  Another hallmark of the program is an emphasis on family connections, including ongoing educational opportunities specifically designed to help family members understand dementia and aspects of the disease and its progression. All communities with the Magnolia Trails program use a resident engagement mobile application where family members can receive real-time photos, videos and updates about their loved ones electronically.  
Respite Care and Temporary Care Programs
Our respite care and temporary care program provides a transitional apartment for seniors who are not entirely ready to return home after a hospital or rehabilitation stay. In addition to a fully furnished apartment, seniors enrolled in this program also have full access to our community’s amenities and services, including 24-hour staffing, delicious and nutritious dining, and scheduled transportation. Our flexible agreement includes a minimum two-week stay that also allows the community's guests to remain for any extended period of time if they so choose.
Home Care Services
Home care services are available through third-party providers to residents living at the majority of our senior housing communities. We believe that the provision of private pay, home care services is an attractive adjunct to our independent living services because it enables us to make available more services to our residents as they age in place and increases the length of stay in our communities. In addition, we make certain customized physician, dentistry, podiatry and other health-related rehabilitation and therapy services available to our residents through third-party providers.

(1)Indicates the date on which we acquired or commenced operating the community. We operated certain of our communities pursuant to management agreements prior to acquiring interests in or leasing the communities.
Operations Overview
We believe that the fragmented nature of the senior living industry, the lack of new supply entering the market, and the limited capital resources available to many small, private operators provides us with an attractive opportunity for competitive differentiation. We believe that our current operations with geographic concentrations throughout the United States and centralized support infrastructure serve as the foundation upon which we can build senior living networks in targeted geographic markets and thereby provide a broad range of high-quality care in a cost-efficient manner. Our operating strategy includes the following core principles:
Provide a Broad Range of Quality Personalized Care
Central to our operating strategy is our focus on providing quality care and services that are personalized and tailored to meet the individual needs of each community resident. Our residences and services are designed to provide a broad range of care that permits residents to thrive and “age in place” as their needs change and as they develop further physical or cognitive frailties. By creating an environment that maximizes resident autonomy and provides individualized service programs, we seek to attract seniors at an earlier stage before they need the higher level of care provided in a skilled nursing facility.
Portfolio Optimization
We continue to focus on the occupancy, rents, and operating margins of our communities. We continually seek to improve occupancy rates and increase average rents by: (i) retaining residents as they “age in place” by extending optional care and service programs, and converting existing units to higher levels of care; (ii) attracting new residents through the use of technology, including enhanced digital marketing through social media and other electronic means, and on-site marketing programs focused on residents and family members; (iii) seeking referrals from senior care referral services and professional community outreach sources, including local religious organizations, senior social service programs, civic and business networks as well as the medical community; (iv) disposing of properties or exiting management agreements of properties that do not meet our long-term goals; and (v) continually refurbishing and renovating our communities.
Offer Services Across a Range of Pricing Options
Our range of products and services is continually expanding to meet the evolving needs of our residents. We have developed a menu of products and service programs that may be further customized to serve the middle-income market of a particular targeted geographic area. By offering a range of pricing options that are customized for each target market, we believe that it can develop synergies, economies of scale and operating efficiencies in our efforts to serve a larger percentage of the senior population within a particular geographic market.
Management Services
As of December 31, 2022, we managed 10 communities on behalf of a third party. Under our existing management arrangements, we receive management fees that are determined by an agreed-upon percentage of gross revenues, incentive management fees (as provided for in the management arrangement), and reimbursement of certain expenses we incur on behalf of the third-party.
Improve Operating Efficiencies
We seek to improve operating efficiencies at our communities by actively monitoring and managing operating costs and by moving to a more centralized operating platform. By having an established portfolio of communities in geographically concentrated regions throughout the United States with regional management teams in place, we believe we have established a platform to achieve operating efficiencies through economies of scale in the purchase of bulk items, such as food and supplies, and in the spreading of fixed costs, such as corporate overhead, over a larger revenue base, and to provide more effective management supervision and financial controls.
Centralized Management
We aim to centralize our corporate and other administrative functions so that the community-based management and staff can focus their efforts on resident care. We maintain centralized accounting, finance, legal, human resources, information technology, operational and capital procurement, training and other operational functions at our support center located in Addison, Texas (the "Dallas Support Center”). Our Dallas Support Center is generally responsible for: (i) establishing Company-wide policies and procedures relating to, among other things, resident care and operations; (ii) performing accounting and legal related functions; (iii) developing employee training programs and materials; (iv) coordinating human resources; (v) coordinating marketing functions; and (vi) providing strategic direction.
We seek to control operational expenses for each of our communities through proprietary expense management systems, standardized management reporting and centralized controls of capital expenditures, asset replacement tracking and purchasing larger and more frequently used supplies and food inventories through group purchasing programs. Community expenditures are monitored by territory directors and vice presidents who are accountable for the resident satisfaction and financial performance of the communities in their territory.
Territory Management
We provide oversight and support to each of our senior housing communities through experienced regional directors and vice presidents. A regional director will generally cover a geographic area consisting of three to twelve communities, while a vice president generally oversees approximately 24 communities.
The executive director at each community reports to a regional director, who in turn reports to a vice president who reports to our Chief Executive Officer.  Regional directors and vice presidents make regular site visits to each of their assigned communities. Site visits involve a physical plant inspection, quality assurance review, focused resident rate review, staff training, financial and systems audits, regulatory compliance, and team building activities.
Community-Based Management and Retention
We devote special attention to the hiring, screening, training, supervising, and retention of our employees and caregivers to ensure that quality standards are achieved. In addition to normal on-site training, we conduct national management meetings and encourage sharing of expertise among managers. We have also implemented a comprehensive online training program that addresses the specific challenges of working within the senior living environment. Our commitment to the total quality management concept is emphasized throughout our training programs. This commitment to the total quality management concept emphasizes the identification of the “best practices” in the senior living market and communication of those “best practices” to our executive directors and their staff. The identification of best practices is realized by a number of means, including: (i) emphasis on territory and executive directors keeping up with professional trade publications; (ii) interaction with other professionals and consultants in the senior living industry through seminars, conferences, and consultations; (iii) visits to other properties; (iv) leadership and participation at national and local trade organization events; and (v) information derived from marketing studies and resident satisfaction surveys. This information is continually processed by territory directors and the executive directors and subsequently communicated to our employees as part of their training.
An executive director manages the day-to-day operations at each senior housing community, which includes maintaining oversight of the quality of care, delivery of resident services, sales and marketing, and monitoring of the community’s financial performance. Depending on the size of the community, the executive director is typically supported by a community-based leadership team consisting of a sales director, wellness director, and business director. However, the executive director is ultimately responsible for all personnel, including food service, maintenance, activities, security, housekeeping and, where applicable, assisted living nursing or care services. In most cases, each community also has department managers who direct the environmental services, nursing or care services, business management functions, dining services, activities, transportation, housekeeping, and marketing functions.
The assisted living component of our senior housing communities is managed by licensed professionals, such as a nurse and/or a licensed administrator. These licensed professionals have many of the same operational responsibilities as our executive directors, but their primary responsibility is to oversee resident care. Many of our senior housing communities are part of a campus setting, which may include independent living, assisted living and/or memory care. This campus arrangement allows for cross-utilization of certain support personnel and services, including administrative functions that result in greater operational efficiencies and lower costs than freestanding facilities.
We actively recruit qualified personnel to maintain adequate staffing levels at our communities. We have adopted comprehensive recruiting and screening programs for management positions that utilize corporate office team interviews and thorough background and reference checks. We offer system-wide training and orientation for all of our employees at the community level through a combination of Company-sponsored seminars and conferences.
Quality Assurance
Quality assurance programs are coordinated and implemented by our corporate and regional staff. Our quality assurance is targeted to achieve maximum resident and resident's family member satisfaction with the care and services that we deliver. Our primary focus in quality control monitoring is to create and maintain a safe and supportive environment for our residents and families, which includes routine in-service training and performance evaluations of caregivers and other support employees. We have established a Corporate Quality Assurance Committee, which consists of the Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer, Vice Presidents of Operations, Vice President and Chief People Officer, Quality and Clinical Directors, and Senior Vice President- General Counsel. The purpose of the committee is to monitor and evaluate the processes by which care is delivered to our residents and the appropriateness and quality of care provided within each of our communities. Additional quality assurance measures include:
Resident and Residents' Family Input.     On a routine basis, residents and their family members provide us with valuable input regarding the day-to-day delivery of services. On-site management at each community has fostered and encouraged active resident councils and resident committees who meet independently. These resident bodies meet with on-site management on a monthly basis to offer input and suggestions as to the quality and delivery of services.
In 2022, we implemented a resident and family satisfaction survey in each of our communities. Working with an outside firm specializing in satisfaction surveys, the survey is designed to focus on high priority areas of senior living, such as resident care, activities, physical fitness, and dining. The survey also includes comparisons to competitors’ results and industry averages. In addition to numeric ratings and industry comparisons, there are also several opportunities for general feedback to ensure residents and families could provide input on any topic. 
Regular Community Inspections.     Each community is inspected in person, on at least a quarterly basis, by a member of the regional and/or operational leadership team, which is also supplemented by virtual site visits. Included as part of this inspection is the monitoring of the overall appearance and maintenance of the community interiors and grounds. The inspection also includes monitoring staff professionalism and departmental reviews of maintenance, housekeeping, activities, transportation, marketing, administration, dining, and health care services, if applicable. The inspections also include observing residents in their daily activities and the community’s compliance with governmental regulations.
Independent Service Evaluations.     We engage the services of outside professional independent consulting firms to evaluate various components of our communities’ operations. These services include mystery shops, competing community analysis and product positioning. These services provide management with valuable and unbiased product and service information. A plan of action regarding any areas requiring improvement or change is implemented based on the information received. At communities where health care is delivered, these consulting service reviews include the on-site handling of medications, recordkeeping and general compliance with all applicable governmental regulations.
Quality Assurance and Regional Support Team.      The Company deploys a support team including senior level community-based resources to provide onboarding, training, and communication of best practices across each of our territories. Each territory designates senior Executive Directors, Wellness Directors, Sales leadership, and Senior Culinary Directors to visit communities across their territory on an ongoing basis. These individuals partner with our Regional Clinical Managers, Regional Operations, and Sales leadership to provide ongoing training and development, complete Quality Assurance reviews on-site, and review the implementation of clinical or resident service programming. In addition, our Director of Program Development and Operations Program Manager work directly with regional leadership on the design and implementation of training programs for our key leadership positions and training materials for ongoing rollout of resident services programming in wellness, memory care, culinary, etc. 
Sales and Marketing
Most communities are staffed with on-site Sales Directors, depending on size and occupancy status. The primary focus of the Sales Director is to perpetuate occupancy and revenue growth by creating awareness about the community and its services among prospective residents and their family members, professional referral sources, and other key decision makers. These efforts are outlined in a strategic plan that includes monthly, quarterly, and annual goals for leasing, new lead generation, prospect follow up, community outreach, resident and family referrals, and promotional events including a market-specific media program.  The Sales Director performs a competing community assessment on a quarterly basis. 
Each Sales Director’s effectiveness and productivity are monitored on a weekly basis. Their compensation is comprised of a variable component tied into both occupancy and rate benchmarks.  A centralized team of sales and marketing resources support communities by developing marketing strategies and campaigns to address the continuously changing resident profile, build brand awareness, increase digital traffic and leads. The marketing strategies focus on driving traffic to our website, national referral partners, and use of social media platforms. To support this, the corporate marketing team develops content, marketing collateral and messaging, manages digital ad buys, and provides ongoing sales and marketing training, support, and best practices.  
Governmental Regulation
Changes in existing laws and regulations, adoption of new laws and regulations, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could have a material effect on our operations. Failure by us to comply with any applicable regulatory requirement could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Accordingly, we regularly monitor legal and regulatory developments on local, state and national levels.
The health care industry is subject to extensive regulation and frequent regulatory changes. At this time, no federal laws or regulations specifically regulate assisted or independent living residences. While some states have not yet enacted specific assisted living regulations, many of our assisted living communities are subject to regulation, licensing and permitting requirements by state and local health care and social service agencies and other governmental regulatory authorities. While such requirements vary from state to state, they typically relate to staffing, training, physical design, patient privacy, required services and the quality thereof, and resident characteristics. We believe that such regulation will increase in the future. In addition, health care providers are experiencing heightened scrutiny under anti-trust laws in the United States as integration and consolidation of health care delivery increases and affects competition. Moreover, robust state and federal enforcement of fraud 
and abuse laws continues. Some of our communities receive a portion of their funds from Medicaid. Such communities are also subject to state and federal Medicaid standards in which noncompliance could result in the imposition of, among other things, penalties, sanctions, suspension, and exclusion from participation in the Medicaid program. Our communities are also subject to various zoning restrictions, local building codes and other ordinances, such as fire safety codes. Failure by us to comply with any applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulation of the assisted living industry is also continually evolving, and we are unable to predict the scope, content or stringency of new regulations and their ultimate effect on our business. There can be no assurance that our operations will not be materially and adversely affected by regulatory developments in the future.
While we believe that our communities are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, unannounced surveys or inspections may occur annually or following a regulator’s receipt of a complaint about a community, any of which could result in a citation of deficiency. In the ordinary course of business, one or more of our communities could be cited for deficiencies resulting from such inspections or surveys from time to time. Although most inspection deficiencies are typically resolved through an agreed-upon plan of corrective action relating to the community’s operations, the reviewing agency typically has the authority to take further action against a licensed or certified community, which could result in the imposition of fines, repayment of amounts previously paid, imposition of a provisional or conditional license, suspension or revocation of a license, suspension or denial of admissions, loss of certification as a provider under federal health care programs or imposition of other sanctions, including criminal penalties. Loss, suspension or modification of a license may also cause us to default under our existing loan agreements and/or trigger cross-defaults. Sanctions may be taken against providers or facilities without regard to the particular provider’s or facility’s history of compliance. We may also expend considerable resources to respond to federal and state investigations or other enforcement actions under applicable laws or regulations. To date, none of the deficiency reports received by us has resulted in a suspension, fine or other disposition that has had a material adverse effect on our revenues. However, any future substantial failure to comply with any applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as a whole. In addition, states’ Attorneys General vigorously enforce consumer protection laws as those laws relate to the senior living industry. State Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Units may also investigate assisted living communities even if the community or any of our residents do not receive federal or state funds.
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. A number of additional federal, state and local laws exist that also may require modifications to existing and planned properties to permit access to the properties by disabled persons. While we believe that our communities are substantially in compliance with present requirements or are exempt therefrom, if required changes involve a greater expenditure than anticipated or must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, additional costs would be incurred by us. Further legislation may impose additional burdens or restrictions with respect to access by disabled persons and the costs of compliance could be substantial.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), in conjunction with the federal regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has established, among other requirements, standards governing the privacy and security of certain protected and individually identifiable health information that is created, received or maintained by a range of covered entities. HIPAA has also established standards governing uniform health care transactions, the codes and identifiers to be used by the covered entities and standards governing the security of certain electronic transactions conducted by covered entities. Penalties for violations can range from civil money penalties for errors and negligent acts to criminal fines and imprisonment for knowing and intentional misconduct. In addition, we may from time to time be subject to a corrective action plan, and the cost associated with complying with any such corrective action plan could be significant.
In addition, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which could require an owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances present at or migrating from properties they own or operate. Such laws and regulations often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was actually responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of any required remediation or removal of these substances could be substantial and the liability of an owner or operator as to any property is generally not limited under such laws and regulations.  Liabilities could exceed the property’s value and the aggregate assets of the owner or operator. The presence of these substances or the failure to remediate such contamination properly may also adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent the property, or to borrow using the property as collateral. Under these laws and regulations, an owner, operator or an entity that arranges for the disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, such as asbestos-containing materials, at a disposal site may also be liable for the costs of any required remediation or removal of the hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal site. In connection with the ownership or operation of our properties, we could be liable for these costs, as well as certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons or properties. We have completed Phase I environmental audits of substantially all of the communities in which we own interests, typically at the time of acquisition or refinancing, and such audits have not revealed as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K any material environmental liabilities that exist with respect to these communities.
Under various U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at or migrating from such property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs. We are not aware, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, of any environmental liability with respect to any of our owned or managed communities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We believe that our communities are in compliance in all material respects with all federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products. We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise aware of any material non-compliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of the communities we currently operate.
We are subject to U.S. federal and state laws, regulations, and executive orders relating to healthcare providers’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which vary based on provider type and jurisdiction, but generally include mandatory requirements for testing of residents and staff, implementation of infection control standards and procedures, restrictions on new admissions or readmissions of residents, required screening of all persons entering a community, restrictions and/or limitations on who may visit residents and how residents may be visited and mandatory notification requirements to residents, families, staff and regulatory bodies related to positive COVID-19 cases. Enhanced or additional penalties may apply for violation of such requirements.
We believe that the structure and composition of government and, specifically, health care regulations will continue to change and, as a result, we regularly monitor material developments and changes in the law that impact our business. We expect to modify our agreements and operations from time to time as the business and regulatory environments change. While we believe we will be able to structure all our agreements and operations in accordance with applicable law, there can be no assurances that our arrangements will not be successfully challenged. These requirements include additional penalties that may apply for violation of such requirements.
Competition
The senior living industry is highly competitive.  Due to the relatively low barriers of entry into the senior living space, we expect that all segments of the industry will become increasingly competitive in the future. Although there are a number of substantial companies fairly active in the senior living industry and in the markets in which we operate, the industry continues to be very fragmented and characterized by numerous small operators. We primarily compete with national operators and other regional and local independent operators. We believe that the primary competitive factors in the senior living industry are: (i) quality of on-site staff; (ii) location; (iii) reputation of, and commitment to, a high quality of service; (iv) support service offerings (such as food services); (v) fair pricing for services provided; and (vi) physical appearance and amenities associated with the communities. We compete with other companies providing independent living, assisted living, skilled nursing, home health care and other similar service and care alternatives, some of which may have greater financial resources than us. Because prospective residents tend to choose senior housing communities in close proximity to their homes, our principal competitors are other senior living and long-term care communities in the same geographic areas as our communities. We also compete with other health care businesses with respect to attracting and retaining nurses, technicians, aides and other high quality professional and non-professional employees and managers that are critical to our business.
Human Capital Resources
We know that our people are at the center of everything we do.  They work individually and collectively each day to provide safety, wellness, care and service to our residents.  As of December 31, 2022, we employed 3,497 persons (88 of whom are employed at our Dallas Support Center), of which 2,420 were full-time employees and 1,077 were part-time employees. Additionally, we had 17 unfilled community leadership positions as of December 31, 2022.
Our Culture
Our culture is the most important connection between all people at Sonida and is rooted in inclusion, respect, accountability, service and deep care for each other and for those we serve.  To create this environment, we focus on attracting, engaging, developing, and retaining the best talent available in each of our markets by maintaining a compelling value proposition for each employee that includes a great work environment, excellent leadership, aligned pay and benefits, career development, and meaningful work. We have built a team with a deep sense of purpose for serving seniors and we believe that our engaged group enhances the resident experience each day.
Inclusion and Diversity
As we serve a diverse group of residents across several states and communities, we also strive to reflect the same diversity in our Company.  We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer.  Our diversity is exhibited by the composition of our workforce with 83% female and 47% non-white employees.  We will continue to strive each day to maintain our inclusive culture through our efforts in recruiting, education, development, and talent progression.
Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention
In our efforts to attract new members to our team, we believe that a local focus, supported by our central talent team, provides the best results.  We continue to add new spaces to our recruiting landscape to ensure we are connecting with the best and brightest individuals.  For example, we utilize local social media pages to identify individuals for the specific communities and geographic regions we serve. We also utilize employee referral programs to bring great new people into our organization who already know our mission through current employees. With our robust focus on talent acquisition, we continued to see our average time to fill an open role shorten significantly in 2022.
We are proud of our development programs that sponsor our current employees in achieving new levels of education, licensure, and credentials.  Through this approach, we support our employees’ growth while they continue to work with us in new roles, enhancing our service and care and providing these employees with additional earning potential.
Total Rewards
We provide fair, competitive, and aligned compensation to all of our people that is reviewed at least annually for both merit and market-based adjustments.  We also offer benefits that are designed to fit a wide variety of needs.  For example, our health plans allow participants to enter the plan at an affordable premium and participants automatically receive unlimited free telehealth and local retail clinic visits, along with all other benefits of the plans.  This benefit provides our people quick and easy access to care at no cost to them when they need to access it. We provide paid time off to both full-time and part-time employees to ensure they have paid time away from work.  We also offer a 401(k) plan that all eligible employees can participate in as they plan for their futures. Our total rewards design includes many other benefits that can be included at the choice of each employee based on his or her needs, which is our overall strategy to providing engaging and flexible rewards for our people.
