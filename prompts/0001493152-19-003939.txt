Overview
 
We were formed in August 2015 to expand upon the successful implementation of a hydrogen energy system used to completely power a residence or commercial property with clean energy so that it can run independent of the utility grid and also provide energy to the utility grid for monetary credits. This system uses renewal energy as its source for hydrogen production. We believe that it is a revolutionary green-energy concept that is safe, renewable, self-sustaining and cost effective.
Market Potential
 
According to the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 2017, renewable energy will represent the largest source of electrical generation through 2040. During that time, the share of renewable energy in global power generation is expected to rise from its current 25% to 40%. This rapid growth in the use of renewable energy is led by continued expansion in renewable energy technology, the need to lessen dependency on fossil fuel energy, grid-based vulnerabilities and the battle against global warming.
 
As we are one of the first providers of a hydrogen energy system for residential housing, we are creating this new market within the renewable energy sector. As a result, there is no expectation or basis for any projections of the future of this market. Since the market did not exist previously, there can only be growth, not a decline, and we are, through the use of these statistics, showing that there is a significant market opportunity for hydrogen energy in the renewable energy sector. While the statistics show that there is expected to be a significant growth in renewable energy market, we cannot provide any assurances as to how much, if any, of this market, we will be able to capture.
 
Technology Overview
 
There are great benefits to hydrogen energy. The use of hydrogen as a fuel produces no carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. Unlike fossil fuels, the sole emission from hydrogen fuel is chemically pure water. Hydrogen can be extracted from water using renewable energy from the sun and unlike batteries, hydrogen energy can be stored indefinitely. There is no drilling, fracking or mining required to produce hydrogen energy. We believe it is safe and efficient, and the cleanest energy source on the planet. In addition to offering this self-sustaining clean energy system using hydrogen and fuel cell technology, we offer a number of renewable energy services, such as audits of energy consumption, review of energy/tax credits available, feasibility studies, solar/battery system installation, zoning/permitting analysis, site design/preparation and restoration, system startup, testing, commissioning, maintenance and interconnection applications.

The HC-1 System
 
We have succeeded in developing a hydrogen energy system designed to create electricity. We call the hydrogen energy system the HC-1. The HC-1 system functions as a self-sustaining renewable energy system. It can be configured as an off grid solution for all your electricity needs or it can be connected to the grid to generate energy credits. Its production of hydrogen is truly eco-friendly, as it is not produced by the use of fossil fuels. It is a system comprised of solar, batteries, a hydrogen generator, a fuel cell and a hydrogen storage tank.
 
When there is sunlight, the solar produce renewable energy that charges a bank of batteries. After the batteries are fully charged, the excess electricity is then combined with water through a hydrogen generator that extracts the hydrogen from the water in a gasified state, which is safely transferred to a tank and stored for later use. If the tank is full, excess electricity is sent from the batteries to the utility grid, which results in energy credits for the system owner.
 
The HC-1 system is connected to the residential or commercial property. The electricity is always provided by the charged batteries. If there is no solar to charge the batteries, the system keeps the batteries fully charged by using hydrogen stored in the tank, which processed through a fuel cell, creates the electricity. As the system is able to produce hydrogen, that keeps the hydrogen tank full, it provides a continuous supply of clean energy and sustainability that is independent from the grid.
 
Each HC-1 system is custom designed to accommodate the electrical loads for an end user. The system is completely scalable. Typically, one HC-1 standard system configuration can provide 40 kWh per day, which is a sufficient amount of electricity to satisfy the daily demand of a majority of homes in the United States. If the customer is connected to the utility grid, excess energy production is transferred to the utility company, creating energy credits.

We are an integrator of technology, so we do not manufacture any of the components of our HC-1 system. All components are purchased from various suppliers. We do not have any formal relationships with any suppliers as all of the components are readily available off-the-shelf from a number of various suppliers. As such, when we need to obtain components, we are able to source such components at that time and at the best available price.
 
Each project is customized to meet the particular needs of the client. Various factors, including the size of the residence or commercial property, the amount of electricity needed to be generated and the amount of solar availability, all impact the price charged on a project.
 
All project work is performed to specifications that meet local utility requirements as well as domestic and international building codes. Once the system is operational, we remotely receive data to monitor its performance and energy efficiency to confirm the system is functioning as expected. We will also provide any additional maintenance required at standard labor rates. Each of the components has a manufacturer’s warranty that is at least one year in duration. If components need to be replaced after the one year workmanship warranty, we will secure replacement components, under warranty if possible, and we will install at our standard labor rates.
 
Growth Strategy
 
We intend to aggressively grow our business, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. We intend to continue to acquire companies with licensed contractors in various states and regions, which will allow us to expand the territories in which we can build our systems. These acquired companies will also provide us with a consistent revenue stream, a customer base for marketing our HC-1 systems and technicians that can be trained to design and install our systems.
Pride Subsidiary
 
On January 31, 2017, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with The Pride Group (QLD) Pty Ltd., an Australian corporation (“Pride”), Turquino Equity LLC (“Turquino”) and Stephen Paul Mullane and Marie Louise Mullane as Trustees of the Mullane Family Trust (together with Turquino, the “Pride Shareholders”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Pride from the Pride Shareholders in exchange for an aggregate of 3,800,000 shares of our common stock. Andrew Hidalgo and Matthew Hidalgo, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, are each a managing partner of Turquino.
 
Pride sells, designs, installs and maintains a variety of technology products in the security systems market, including commercial alarm systems, access control and video surveillance. Pride also provides annual maintenance contracts. The division generates approximately half of its revenue from government contracts and the other half from the commercial sector. Pride has recurring annual maintenance revenue of close to AUD $2 million. Pride is a certified security systems integrator for the Queensland Government and has various government contracts in place for installation, maintenance and project services. Pride also works with a number of general contractors as a subcontractor for security systems integration.
 
Pride has a renewable energy division that designs, installs and maintains a variety of technology services in the clean energy market, including audits of energy consumption, review of energy and tax credits available, feasibility studies, solar/battery energy system design, zoning and permitting analysis, site design/preparation and restoration, system startup, testing and commissioning and maintenance. The division has a significant bid list and has begun to generate limited revenue for renewable energy systems focusing on the residential, commercial and government sectors.

PVBJ Subsidiary
 
On February 1, 2018, we acquired PVBJ, Inc. (“PVBJ”) of Downingtown, Pennsylvania for $1 million of HCCC stock and $221,800 in cash. Established in 2008 and historically profitable, PVBJ is well recognized for the design, installation, maintenance and emergency service of environmental systems both in residential and commercial markets. PVBJ is now expanding into renewable energy systems. PVBJ has an extensive and notable customer base.
 
Competition
 
Given the increasing focus on renewable energy to offset the environmental problems caused by fossil fuels, the renewable energy industry is highly competitive, and rapidly evolving. Our major competitors include leading global companies, and other regional and local energy providers.
 
In the markets where we plan to conduct business, we will compete with many energy producers including electric utilities and large independent power producers. There is also competition from fossil fuel sources such as natural gas and coal, and other renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. The competition depends on the resources available within the specific markets. However, we believe that our system allows us to compete favorably with traditional utilities and other renewable energy systems in the regions we service.
 
Although the cost to produce clean, reliable, renewable energy is becoming more competitive with traditional fossil fuel sources, it generally remains more expensive to produce, and the reliability of its supply is less consistent than traditional fossil fuel. Deregulation and consumer preference are becoming important factors in increasing the development of renewable energy projects.
 
However, as a company with only a short operating history, substantially all of our competitors have advantages over us in terms of greater operational, financial, technical, management or other resources in particular markets or in general. While hydrogen energy has certain advantages when compared to other power generating technologies, it is one of the newer and less established methods of renewable energy and therefore currently has less market acceptance.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
We are subject to laws and regulations affecting our operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company’s activities which include, but are not limited to, the areas of zoning, permitting, labor, advertising, consumer protection, real estate, billing, quality of services, intellectual property and ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, and health and safety. In the U.S., our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety. We expend resources to maintain compliance with OSHA requirements and industry best practices.
Regulatory Matters
 
If a customer wishes to connect our system to the electrical grid in order to generate energy credits, the customer needs to obtain interconnection agreements from the applicable local primary electricity utility. Prior to an installation of the HC-1 system, on behalf of the customer, we will submit an interconnection application with the local public utility company to become a certified renewable energy generator. Approval of the application is based on a balance of historical consumption and the amount of renewable energy to be produced. In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over interconnection. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection agreements are signed. In our experience, there has not been any cost involved in obtaining an interconnection agreement, but as the requirements are determined on a local basis, it may be possible that some nominal costs are involved in connection with the process.
Government Incentives
 
We intend to focus on states or countries whose government supports a regulatory standard requiring its utility companies to increase their production of energy from renewable energy sources. These governments have established various incentives and financial mechanisms to accelerate and promote the use of renewable energy sources. If the customer obtains an interconnection agreement from the applicable local primary electricity utility, once the HC-1 system is operational, the HC-1 system end user can eliminate their electric bill and, if in a permissible state, can begin generating energy credits.

H/CELL ENERGY CORPORATION
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017
 

1. | ORGANIZATION AND LINE OF BUSINESS 
---+--------------------------------------

 
H/Cell Energy Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 17, 2015. The Company, based in Dallas, Texas, is a company whose principal operations consist of designing and installing clean energy systems with a focus on hydrogen energy. Effective January 31, 2017, the Company acquired The Pride Group (QLD) Pty Ltd, an Australian company (“Pride”) (see Note 11). Founded in 1997, Pride is a provider of security systems integration for a variety of customers in the government and commercial sector and has launched a new clean energy systems division to focus on the high growth renewable energy market in Asia-Pacific. The new clean energy division has generated some revenue and has begun to bid a number of projects. On February 1, 2018, the Company acquired PVBJ Inc. (“PVBJ”) for 444,445 shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value of $1,177,779 and $221,800 in earn-out liability (see Note 12). Established in 2008, PVBJ is well recognized for the design, installation, maintenance and emergency service of environmental systems both in residential and commercial markets. PVBJ is now expanding into clean energy systems.
 
The Company has developed a hydrogen energy system for residential and commercial use designed to create electricity. This system uses renewable energy as its source for hydrogen production. It functions as a self-sustaining clean energy system using hydrogen and fuel cell technology. It can be configured as an off grid solution for all electricity needs or it can be connected to the grid to generate energy credits. Its production of electricity is truly eco-friendly, as it is not produced by the use of fossil fuels. It is a revolutionary green-energy concept that is safe, renewable, self-sustaining and cost effective.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Reclassification
 
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
 
Accounts Receivable
 
Accounts receivable are recorded when invoices are issued and are presented in the balance sheet net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the Company’s historical losses, the existing economic conditions in the construction industry, and the financial stability of its customers. Accounts are written off as uncollectible after collection efforts have failed. In addition, the Company does not generally charge interest on past-due accounts or require collateral. At December 31, 2018 and December 31 2017, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts required.
 
Property and Equipment, and Depreciation
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is generally provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement.

Repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the lives of the property and equipment are charged to expense as incurred.
 
Goodwill and Finite Intangible Assets
 
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the following (1) consideration transferred, (2) the fair value of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and (3) if the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of our previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of customer lists and relationships, non-compete agreements and technology based intangibles and other contractual agreements. The Company amortizes finite lived identifiable intangible assets over 5 years, on a straight-line basis to their estimated residual values and periodically reviews them for impairment. Total identifiable intangible assets comprised 41% of our consolidated total assets at December 31, 2018. There were no intangible assets or goodwill at December 31, 2017.
 
The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for all business combinations and does not amortize goodwill. Goodwill is tested for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If the Company can support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would not need to perform the two-step impairment test for that reporting unit. If the Company cannot support such a conclusion or the Company does not elect to perform the qualitative assessment then the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, its goodwill is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment, if any. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
 
The Company performed its annual impairment test for PVBJ. Based on the results of the qualitative testing, the fair value did not exceed the carrying value. The PVBJ reporting unit exceeded acquisition projections in 2018 and expects to meet future projections.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had recorded goodwill in the amount of $1,373,621 related to the PVBJ acquisition. The performance of the Company’s fiscal 2018 impairment analysis did not result in an impairment of the Company’s goodwill.
 
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
 
Comprehensive income (loss) consists of two components, net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). The Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments.
Advertising Costs
 
Advertising costs are charged to expense during the period in which they are incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $4,426 and $3,166, respectively.
 
Foreign Currency Translation
 
The Company translates its foreign subsidiary’s assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at current rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date and income and expense items at the average exchange rate for the reporting period. Translation adjustments resulting from exchange rate fluctuations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company records gains and losses from changes in exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than each reporting location’s functional currency in net income (loss) for each period. Items included in the financial statements of each entity in the group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“functional currency”).

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded other comprehensive gain from a translation gain of $21,996 in the consolidated financial statements.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“Topic 606”) using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of December 31, 2017. Results for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period.
 
Under ASC Topic 606 requirements, the Company recognizes revenue from the installation or construction of projects and service or short term projects over time using the cost-based input method. The Company accounts for a contract when: (i) it has approval and commitment from both parties, (ii) the rights of the parties are identified, (iii) payment terms are identified, (iv) the contract has commercial substance, and (v) collectability of consideration is probable. The Company considers the start of a project to be when the above criteria have been met and the Company either has written authorization from the customer to proceed or an executed contract. A detailed breakdown of the five step process is as follows:
 
Identify the contract with a customer:
 
The Company receives almost all of its contracts from only two sources, referrals or government bids. In a referral, a client that the company has an ongoing business relationship refers the company to perform services. In a government bid, the Company applies to perform services for public projects. The contracts have a pattern of being stand-alone contracts.
 
Identify the performance obligations in the contract:
 
The performance obligation of the company is to perform a contractually agreed upon task for the customer. If the contract is stated to provide only contractual service, then the service is considered the only performance obligation. If the contractual service includes design and or engineering in addition to the contract, it is considered a single performance obligation.
 
Determine the transaction price:
 
The nature of the industry involves a number of uncertainties that can affect the current state of the contract. Variable consideration are the estimates made due to a contract modification in the contractual service. Change orders, claims, extras, or back charges are common in contractual services activity as a form of variable consideration. If there is going to be a contract modification, judgment by management will need to be made to determine if the variable consideration is enforceable. The following factors are considered in determining if the variable consideration is enforceable:
 

1. | The customer’s written approval of the scope of the change order; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Current contract language that indicates clear and enforceable entitlement relating to the change order; 
3. | Separate documentation for the change order costs that are identifiable and reasonable; or 
4. | The Company’s favorable experience in negotiating change orders, especially as it relates to the specific type of contract and change order being evaluated 

 
Once the Company receives a contract, a budget of projected costs are generated for the contract based on the contract price. The Company has a trend of overestimating costs to the project in order to reduce the frequency of change orders required for a project. If the scope of the contract during the contractual period needs to be modified the company typically files a change order. The company does not continue to perform services until the change modification is agreed upon with documentation by both the company and the client. There are few times that claims, extras, or back charges are included in the contract.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017
 
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract:
 
If there are multiple performance obligations to the contract, the costs must be allocated appropriately and consistently to each performance obligation. In the company’s experience, usually only one performance obligation is stated per contract. If there are multiple services provided for one client, the company has a policy of splitting out the services over multiple contracts.
 
Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligations:
 
The Company uses the total costs incurred on the project relative to the total expected costs to satisfy the performance obligation. The input method involves measuring the resources consumed, labor hours expended, costs incurred, time lapsed, or machine hours used relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of the performance obligation. Costs incurred prior to actual contract (i.e. design, engineering, procurement of material, etc.) should not be recognized as the client does not have control of the good/service provided. When the estimate on a contract indicates a loss, or claims against costs incurred reduce the likelihood of recoverability of such costs, the Company records the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known. Project contracts typically provide for a schedule of billings or invoices to the customer based on the Company’s job to date percentage of completion of specific tasks inherent in the fulfillment of its performance obligation(s). The schedules for such billings usually do not precisely match the schedule on which costs are incurred. As a result, contract revenue recognized in the statement of operations can and usually does differ from amounts that can be billed or invoiced to the customer at any point during the contract. Amounts by which cumulative contract revenue recognized on a contract as of a given date exceed cumulative billings and unbilled receivables to the customer under the contract are reflected as a current asset in the Company’s balance sheet under the captions “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings” and “Unbilled accounts receivable.” Amounts by which cumulative billings to the customer under a contract as of a given date exceed cumulative contract revenue recognized on the contract are reflected as a current liability in the Company’s balance sheet under the caption “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings.”
 
Disaggregated Revenue:
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from contracts with customers summarized by Segment Geography and Revenue Stream were as follows:
 

 | 2018 | | 2017 | 
-------------------------+------+-----------+------+--
United States - Service | $ | 2,440,854 | | $ | - 
Australia - Service | | 1,941,078 | | | 1,877,755

Australia - Contract | | 3,123,957 | | | 4,389,212
Total | $ | 7,546,437 | | $ | 6,352,886

Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in bank and money market funds as well as other highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. The Company had no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. At times during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, balances exceeded the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
The Company recognizes expense for its stock-based compensation based on the fair value of the awards at the time they are granted. We estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, expected term, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends and expected forfeiture rates. The forfeiture rate is estimated using historical option cancellation information, adjusted for anticipated changes in expected exercise and employment termination behavior. Our outstanding awards do not contain market or performance conditions.

Sales and Use Tax
 
The Company collects sales tax in various jurisdictions. Upon collection from customers, it records the amount as a payable to the related jurisdiction. On a periodic basis, it files a sales tax return with the jurisdictions and remits the amount indicated on the return.
Income Taxes
 
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and credit carryforwards, and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 
The determination of the Company’s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company’s financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses these probabilities and records any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense.
 
The Company recognizes and measures its unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with ASC 740. Under that guidance, management assesses the likelihood that tax positions will be sustained upon examination based on the facts, circumstances and information, including the technical merits of those positions, available at the end of each period. The measurement of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted when new information is available, or when an event occurs that requires a change.
 
The Company did not identify any material uncertain tax positions. The Company did not recognize any interest or penalties for unrecognized tax benefits.
 
The federal income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the IRS, generally for the three years after they are filed. The Company’s 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 income tax returns are still open for examination by the taxing authorities.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
Except for the Company’s earn-out liability, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and short-term borrowings, as reflected in the balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. All other significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practicable the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed. The Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories:

● | Level 1—quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Level 2—observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; and 
● | Level 3—significant unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.

The table below presents a reconciliation of the fair value of the Company’s contingent earn-out obligations that use significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).
 

Balance at December 31, 2017 | $ | - 
-----------------------------------------------------+---+--------
Earn-out liability from acquisition of PVBJ Inc. | | 175,318
Payments | | - 
Adjustments to fair value | | 15,418 
Balance at December 31, 2018 | $ | 190,736

 
The Company values earn-out obligations using a probability weighted discounted cash flow method. This fair value measurement is based on significant unobservable inputs in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the purchase agreements (e.g., minimum and maximum payments, length of earn-out periods, manner of calculating any amounts due, etc.) and utilizes assumptions with regard to future cash flows, probabilities of achieving such future cash flows and a discount rate. The contingent earn-out obligations are measured at fair value each reporting period and changes in estimates of fair value are recognized in earnings.
 
Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share 
 
The Company computes basic net income (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) per share available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period and excludes the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share, if presented, would include the dilution that would occur upon the exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities into common stock using the “treasury stock” and/or “if converted” methods as applicable. The computation of diluted loss per share excludes dilutive securities for the year ended December 31, 2018 because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Dilutive securities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

 | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017 
-------------------------------------+-----------------------+-----------+----------------------
Options to purchase common stock | | 955,000 | | 1,050,000

Totals | | 1,755,000 | | 1,050,000


3. | RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
---+-------------------------------

 
The Company’s former office space during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 consisted of approximately 800 square feet, which was donated to it from one of its executive officers. There was no lease agreement and the Company paid no rent.
 
Effective February 4, 2016, the Company sold 526,316 shares of common stock to Reza Enterprises, Inc., an entity beneficially owned by Rezaul Karim. In connection with, and as a condition of closing, the Company agreed to appoint Rezaul Karim to its board of directors. Rezaul Karim resigned from the board of directors effective April 1, 2017. On April 1, 2017, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Rezaul Karim for a period of one year to promote our products and services. In April of 2017 and 2018, Rezaul Karim exercised 100,000 options.
 
In June 2016, the Company entered into a contract with Rezaul Karim, one of its former directors, for the installation of an HC-1 system. The system installation was complete pending any change orders as of December 31, 2018, and generated $31,789 and $85,919 of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company subcontracted the installation of the system to Renewable Energy Holdings LLC (“REH”), a company owned by Mike Strizki, one of the Company’s executive officers. James Strizki, one of the Company’s executive officers, is vice president of operations at REH. Costs incurred for REH were $31,617 and $87,649 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
In September 2018, the Company entered into a contract with Steve Mullane, the Executive General Manager of Pride, for a solar installation. The system installation was complete as of December 31, 2018 and generated $8,759 of revenue in 2018 along with costs of $8,759.

The Company has entered into agreements to indemnify its directors and executive officers, in addition to the indemnification provided for in the Company’s articles of incorporation and bylaws. These agreements, among other things, provide for indemnification of the Company’s directors and executive officers for certain expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any such person in any action or proceeding, including any action by or in the right of the Company, arising out of such person’s services as a director or executive officer of the Company, any subsidiary of the Company or any other company or enterprise to which the person provided services at the Company’s request. The Company believes that these provisions and agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and executive officers.
 
At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the balances due to Turquino Equity LLC (Turquino”), a significant shareholder, amounted to $0 and $31,257, respectively. These balances represent expenses for management services. There was $78,000 of management fees expensed for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $184,004 for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
On January 2, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with two of its directors, pursuant to which the Company sold an aggregate principal amount of $400,000 in 12% Convertible Debentures (“Debentures”), convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.75 per share. The Debentures, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, become due and payable on January 2, 2020 (the “Maturity Date”). Interest on the Debentures accrues at the rate of 12% per annum, payable monthly in cash, beginning on February 1, 2018 and through the Maturity Date. The Debentures are convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $0.75 per share at the discretion of the holder, with special provisions applying to any holder whose conversion would result in the holder beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the Company’s common stock. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the Debentures were amended to reduce the interest rate to 10% and reduce the conversion price to $0.50 (see Note 20). In connection with this convertible note payable, the Company recorded a $395,000 discount on debt, related to the beneficial conversion feature of the note to be amortized over the life of the note using the effective interest method, or until the note is converted or repaid.
 
On August 21, 2018, PVBJ entered into a loan and security agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Thermo Communications Funding, LLC (“Thermo”). The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving line of credit in an amount not to exceed $350,000, which is evidenced by a promissory note issued by PVBJ to Thermo (the “Note”). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, PVBJ granted a security interest to Thermo in all of its assets. In addition, pursuant to a limited recourse guaranty, Andrew Hidalgo, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer personally guaranteed the repayment of the Credit Agreement under certain conditions.
 

4. | SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK 
---+----------------------------------------------

 
Cash is maintained at an authorized deposit-taking institution (bank) incorporated in both the United States and Australia and is insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Australian Securities & Investments Commission up to $250,000 and approximately $186,000 USD in total, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 the balance was fully covered under the $250,000 threshold in the United States. In Australia the balance exceeded the threshold by $133,578 at December 31, 2018 and $265,273 at December 31, 2017.
 
Credit risk for trade accounts is concentrated as well because substantially all of the balances are receivable from entities located within certain geographic regions. To reduce credit risk, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial conditions, but does not generally require collateral. In addition, at December 31, 2018, approximately 20% of the Company’s accounts receivable was due from two unrelated customers, each at 10%. At December 31, 2017, approximately 36% of the Company’s accounts receivable was due from three unrelated customers, 14%, 12% and 10%, respectively.
 

5. | MAJOR CUSTOMERS 
---+--------------------

 
There were three customers with a concentration of 10% or higher of the Company’s revenue, two at 13% and one at 12% for the year ended December 31, 2018, and three customers, at 24% and two at 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Convertible Note Payable
 
On January 2, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with two related parties, who are directors of the Company and issued a 12.0% interest bearing convertible debenture for $400,000 due on January 2, 2020, with conversion features commencing immediately following the date of the note. Payments of interest only were due monthly beginning January 2018. The Debentures are convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $0.75 per share at the discretion of the holder, with special provisions applying to any holder whose conversion would result in the holder beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the Company’s common stock. In connection with this convertible note payable, the Company recorded a $395,000 discount on debt, related to the beneficial conversion feature of the note to be amortized over the life of the note using the effective interest method, or until the note is converted or repaid. The Company incurred $5,000 of legal fees for preparation of the financing documents, which has been reflected as an additional debt discount.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred interest expense of $106,206, of which $29,122 related to the amortization of the discount.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred no interest expense.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding table represents the total pretax intrinsic value, based on options with an exercise price less than the Company’s weighted average grant date stock price of $0.3958 per share, which would have been received by the option holders had those option holders exercised their options as of that date. It also includes options granted at exercise prices of $2.00, $1.50, and $1.00, which were equal to the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock on the dates of grant.
 
Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions. The fair value of stock-based payment awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option model with a volatility figure derived from an index of historical stock prices of comparable entities until sufficient data exists to estimate the volatility using the Company’s own historical stock prices. Management determined this assumption to be a more accurate indicator of value.
 
The Company accounts for the expected life of options based on the contractual life of options for non-employees. For incentive options granted to employees, the Company accounts for the expected life in accordance with the “simplified” method, which is used for “plain-vanilla” options, as defined in the accounting standards codification. The risk-free interest rate was determined from the implied yields of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a remaining life consistent with the expected term of the options. The fair value of stock-based payment awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
 
As of December 31, 2018, there was $56,745 of unrecognized compensation expense. At December 31, 2017, there was $110,366 of unrecognized compensation expense.

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had deferred tax assets of $430,000 and $235,000, respectively, against which a valuation allowance of $380,000 and $191,000, respectively, had been recorded. The change in the valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2018 was an increase of $189,000. The increase in the valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2018 was mainly attributable to increases in U.S. net operating losses and share-based compensation, which resulted in an increase in the Company’s deferred tax assets. The Company established valuation allowances equal to the full amount of its U.S. deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty of the realization of these deferred tax assets in future periods. The Company periodically assesses the likelihood that it will be able to recover the deferred tax assets. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income.

U.S. federal statutory tax rate | | 21.0 | % | | 34.0 | %

The Company had approximately $749,000 and $235,000 of gross net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards (U.S. federal and state) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which begin to expire after 2036 through 2038. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, and similar state regulations, contain provisions that may limit the NOL carryforwards available to be used to offset income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events, including changes in the ownership interests of significant stockholders. In the event of a cumulative change in ownership in excess of 50% over a three-year period, the amount of the NOL carryforwards that the Company may utilize in any one year may be limited.
 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was enacted in December 2017. Among other things, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, eliminates the alternative minimum tax for corporations, and creates a one-time deemed repatriation of profits earned outside of the U.S. The reduction of the corporate tax rate resulted in a write-down of the Company’s gross deferred tax assets of approximately $88,000, and a corresponding write-down of the valuation allowance. The one-time deemed repatriation of profits by the Company’s Australian subsidiary in 2017 resulted in a decrease in its NOL of approximately $64,000.
 

18. | RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
----+-------------------------------------

 
In May 2014, the FASB issued accounting standard update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU 2014-09”). The standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under previous guidance. This may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB approved the proposal to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 standard by one year. Early adoption was permitted after December 15, 2016, and the standard became effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. In 2016, the FASB issued final amendments to clarify the implementation guidance for principal versus agent considerations (ASU No. 2016-08), accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations (ASU No. 2016-10), narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients (ASU No. 2016-12) and technical corrections and improvements to ASU 2014-09 (ASU No. 2016-20) in its new revenue standard. The Company has performed a review of the requirements of the new revenue standard and is monitoring the activity of the FASB and the transition resource group as it relates to specific interpretive guidance. The Company reviewed customer contracts, applied the five-step model of the new standard to its contracts, and compared the results to its current accounting practices. The Company has included disclosures required by the new standard and the adoption has not had a material impact on the financial statements.
 
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments — Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted with the exception of certain provisions related to the presentation of other comprehensive income. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

H/CELL ENERGY CORPORATION
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), (“ASU 2016-02”) and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance. This ASU requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than 12 months. Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. Similar modifications have been made to lessor accounting in-line with revenue recognition guidance. The amendments also require certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Entities are required to adopt ASC 842 using a modified retrospective transition method. Full retrospective transition is prohibited. The guidance permits an entity to apply the standard’s transition provisions at either the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements or the beginning of the period of adoption (i.e., on the effective date). We expect to adopt the new standard on its effective date. While the Company continues to assess all of the effects of adoption, it currently believes the most significant effects relate to: the recognition of new ROU assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet for real estate and equipment operating leases; and providing significant new disclosures about its leasing activities. The Company does not expect a significant change in its leasing activities between now and adoption. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. The Company expects to elect the ‘package of practical expedients’, which permits it to not reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company does not expect to elect the use-of hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter not being applicable to it.
 
On adoption, the Company currently expects to recognize additional operating lease liabilities with corresponding ROU assets of the same amount based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments for existing operating leases on its consolidated balance sheets. The new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. The Company currently expects to elect the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. This means, for those leases that qualify, the Company will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition. The Company also currently expects to elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of its leases, which will mean all consideration that is fixed, or in-substance fixed, relating to the non-lease components will be captured as part of its lease components for balance sheet purposes.
 
In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” (“ASU 2016-15”). ASU 2016-15 clarifies the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted ASU 2016-15 effective January 1, 2018 and it did not have a material impact on its financial statements.
 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU 2017-04”). ASU 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 as part of the goodwill impairment test. The amount of the impairment charge to be recognized would now be the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The loss to be recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments in ASU 2017-04 are effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company has elected to early adopt ASU 2017-04 as of January 1, 2018. The Company has applied the guidance related to ASU 2017-04 during its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2018. An entity should apply the amendments in this update on a prospective basis. An entity is required to disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle upon transition. That disclosure should be provided in the first annual period and in the interim period within the entity initially adopts the amendments in this update. The Company has elected to early adopt this standard in performing their 2018 impairment test.
 
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting (“ASU 2017-09”) to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under this new guidance, modification accounting is required if the fair value, vesting conditions, or classification of the award changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. ASU 2017-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within each annual reporting period. The Company adopted ASU 2017-09 effective January 1, 2018 and it did not have a material impact on its financial statements.

In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (ASC 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2018-07”). ASU 2018-07 simplifies the accounting for nonemployee share-based payment transactions. Consequently, the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees and employees will be substantially aligned. The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
 
In August 2018, the FASB issue ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding certain disclosures. The new standard will become effective for the Company January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
 
Management does not believe there would have been a material effect on the accompanying financial statements had any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards been adopted in the current period.
 

19. | EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE 
----+------------------------------

 
The following table sets forth the information needed to compute basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share:
 

 | Year Ended December 31, 2018 | | | Year Ended December 31, 2017 | 
-------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------+---+-----------------------------------+--
Net income (loss) | $ | (554,010 | ) | | $ | 8,897 
Weighted average common shares outstanding | | 7,586,024 | | | | 6,703,223
Dilutive securities Convertible debt | | 601,704 | | | | - 
Options | | 951,034 | | | | 996,520 
Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding | | 7,586,024 | | | | 7,699,743
Basic net income (loss) per share | $ | (0.07 | ) | | | 0.00 
Diluted net income (loss) per share | $ | (0.07 | ) | | | 0.00 

 
For the year ended December 31, 2018 certain potential shares of common stock have been excluded from the calculation of diluted income per share because of a net loss, and therefore, the effect on diluted income per share would have been anti-dilutive. 
 

20. | NOTE PAYABLE 
----+-----------------

 
On August 21, 2018, PVBJ entered into a loan and security agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Thermo Communications Funding, LLC (“Thermo”). The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving line of credit in an amount not to exceed $350,000, which is evidenced by a promissory note issued by PVBJ to Thermo (the “Note”). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, PVBJ granted a security interest to Thermo in all of its assets. In addition, pursuant to a limited recourse guaranty, Andrew Hidalgo, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer personally guaranteed the repayment of the Credit Agreement under certain conditions. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is permitted to borrow up to $350,000 under the revolving credit line, under a borrowing base equal to the lesser of (i) or 85% of Eligible Accounts (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and to refinance certain existing debt of PVBJ. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default. Principal covenants include a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.15 to 1.0, a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.15 to 1.0, and maintaining a tangible net worth of at least $150,000, excluding intercompany loans to H/Cell. The loan commitment shall expire on August 21, 2020. As of December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. The interest rate applicable to revolving loans under the Credit Agreement is prime plus 5.0%, subject to a minimum interest rate of 9.5%. The Company paid a loan commitment fee of $7,000, of which $3,500 was paid on closing, and $3,500 will be paid on the first anniversary. The Company will also pay a monthly monitoring fee during the term of the Credit Agreement of 0.33% of the average outstanding balance, payable monthly in arrears. The Company may prepay the Note at any time and terminate the Credit Agreement. In the event that the Company terminates the Credit Agreement, the Company will pay Thermo an early termination fee equal to 4% of the pro rata portion, which pro rata portion is determined by multiplying $350,000 by the number of months prior to the second anniversary of the effective date of the Credit Agreement and then dividing that by 24. The obligations of PVBJ under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement, which includes customary events of default including, without limitation, payment defaults, defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, cross-defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, an ERISA reportable event occurs, a change of control and a change in the Company’s financial condition that could have a material adverse effect on the Company. As of December 31, 2018, funds totaling $38,296 were available for borrowing under the Thermo Credit Agreement.

In accordance with FASB ASC 855, Subsequent Events, the Company has evaluated subsequent events through March _ 2019, the date on which these financial statements were available to be issued.
 
On January 21, 2019, an aggregate of 15,000 non-statutory options were granted to one employee with such options vesting 25% on each of the first through fourth anniversary of issuance, expiring five years from the date of issuance and having an exercise price of $1.15, which is equal to the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.
 
On February 8, 2019, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with two of its directors that are accredited investors, pursuant to which it sold an aggregate principal amount of $150,000 in 10% Convertible Debentures (the “2019 Debentures”), convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.50 per share. The 2019 Debentures, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, become due and payable on February 8, 2021 (the “2021 Maturity Date”). Interest on the 2019 Debentures will accrue at the rate of 10% per annum, payable monthly in cash, beginning on March 1, 2019 and on the 2021 Maturity Date. The 2019 Debentures will be convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $0.50 per share at the discretion of the holder, with special provisions applying to any holder whose conversion would result in the holder beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the Company’s common stock.
 
On February 8, 2019, the Company and the holders of the Debentures issued in January 2018 entered into amendments (the “Amendments”) to the Debentures. Pursuant to the Amendments, the conversion price of the Debentures was reduced from $0.75 to $0.50, and the interest rate on the Debentures was reduced from 12% to 10%.
 
Equity Purchase Agreement
 
On March 12, 2019, the Company entered into an equity purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) and a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with an accredited investor (the “Investor”), pursuant to which the Investor has agreed to purchase from the Company up to $450,000 in shares (the “Shares”) of its common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement.
 
Under the Purchase Agreement, the Investor has the right, at any time, to purchase Shares by delivering the Company a purchase notice, specifying the number of Shares to be purchased. The purchase price for the Shares under the Purchase Agreement will be 60% of the lowest closing price of the Company’s common stock in the five consecutive trading days preceding the Investor’s receipt of the Shares subject to such equity purchase.
 
In addition, the Investor has an obligation, to the extent it has not already made voluntary purchases, to purchase up to (i) $200,000 of the $450,000 in Shares within 15 Trading Days (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined below) and (ii) $450,000 in Shares within 70 Trading Days after the effective date of the Registration Statement.
 
The Company has the right to reject any purchase notice from the Investor by delivering written notice of such rejection within one trading day after receipt. If the Company rejects any purchase notice, the Investor has no further obligations to purchase Shares under the Purchase Agreement. The Company may terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time by written notice to the Investor in the event of a material breach of the Purchase Agreement by the Investor. In addition, the Purchase Agreement will automatically terminate on the earliest of: (i) the date that the Investor has purchased $450,000 of Shares; (ii) 70 Trading Days after the effective date of the Registration Statement; or (iii) the date the Registration Statement is no longer effective.
 
The obligation of the Investor to purchase the Shares is subject to several conditions, including, among other thing, (i) that the Company has an effective registration statement with the SEC registering the Shares for resale, and (ii) that the purchase of the Shares shall not cause the Investor to own more than 9.99% of the outstanding shares of common stock. In connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to pay $15,000 of fees to the Investor, of which $10,000 was paid on execution of the Purchase Agreement, and the remaining $5,000 will be paid on the first sale of Shares.
 
Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company is required to register the Shares on a registration statement (the “Registration Statement”) to be filed with the SEC within 15 calendar days after it files the Annual Report on Form 10-K that these financial statements are part of.
 
Additionally, on March 12, 2019, the Company agreed to donate 35,000 shares of common stock to the manager of the Investor.
