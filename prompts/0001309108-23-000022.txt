ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
WEX’s mission is focused on simplifying the business of running a business. WEX owns and operates a B2B ecosystem that helps our customers overcome highly manual processes and reconciliations, navigate the complexity of consumer driven healthcare benefits and solve their administrative challenges. We believe that WEX offers the marketplace a unique combination of capabilities to simplify complexity, thereby setting WEX’s offerings apart from those of our competition, including:
•Global commerce platform. Our technology is engineered and operated with global scale and reliability. We have invested heavily, and expect to continue to invest, in technology. Using our technology, our customers have trusted us to conduct hundreds of billions in money movements in more than 20 currencies. We believe that our products and services play integral roles in the infrastructure of businesses. 
•Personalized solutions, seamlessly embedded. We believe WEX is a leader in our end markets with solutions shaped by customer focused innovation and deep industry expertise. Both in our direct-to-corporate and partner channels, our solutions focus on simplifying the business of running a business by deeply embedding our solutions within our end customer workflows.
•Insights that power success. Customers look to WEX for a powerful combination of specialized expertise and rich data to assist them in driving better decisions, moving more quickly, and in dealing with risk. We put control in the hands of our customers.
Leveraging these unique capabilities, WEX offers solutions that organizations use to drive efficiencies and manage risk. As of December 31, 2022, these solutions, which share and benefit from our underlying capabilities such as payment processing, data analytics, and WEX Bank, are provided across three business segments:
•Fleet Solutions. WEX reimagines mobility across fleets of all sizes. WEX has more than 600,000 fleet customers worldwide and partners with 9 of the top 10 U.S. fuel retailers.
•Health and Employee Benefit Solutions. WEX simplifies administration of benefits for employers, including consumer directed health accounts in the United States both directly and through partners. We serve more than half of the Fortune 1000 companies in the United States.
Table of Contents

•Travel and Corporate Solutions. WEX is both one of the largest commercial payment companies in the world as well as a trusted technology partner for some of the largest organizations in the world. WEX is unique in our space as we couple wholly owned market leading technology with a global issuing and funding capability.
Our wholly owned subsidiary, WEX Bank, currently funds the majority of our Fleet and Travel and Corporate Solutions operations, provides us with credit adjudication services, and is a depository institution for certain custodial HSA cash assets. We believe that our ownership of WEX Bank provides us with a competitive advantage through access to low cost sources of capital and liquidity and enables us to design funding solutions for customers that complement our technology solutions.
The combination of our capabilities across segments forms a diverse B2B ecosystem for us to provide products and services to our customers, as depicted in the following graphic:
We believe our ecosystem of solutions provides the Company with multiple and diverse levers and opportunities to help WEX achieve its financial and business goals. Current goals include winning new customers, growing our share of wallet, expanding and diversifying our offering, deepening our global presence, and executing strategic mergers and acquisitions. Our existing and evolving technology, talented workforce, and robust customer and partner footprint all continue to drive our business forward and we expect will help us achieve our goals. We have established a growth engine in large end markets and we believe we are leaders in the markets in which we participate. 
Seasonality
Certain parts of our business are affected by seasonal variations. For example, in a typical year, fuel prices are typically higher during the summer and online travel sales are typically higher during the third quarter. In addition, we experience seasonality in our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment as consumer spend is correlated with insurance deductibles, typically resulting in higher spend in the early part of the year until employees meet their deductibles.
Our Business Segments
FLEET SOLUTIONS SEGMENT 
Overview
Within our Fleet Solutions segment, WEX is a leader in fleet vehicle payment solutions, transaction processing, and information management services. We address the marketplace through three different business units.
Table of Contents

•North American Fleet. Addresses the needs of businesses that utilize primarily light and medium duty vehicles central to the operation of the service economy in North America.
•Over-the-Road. Addresses the needs of businesses that utilize primarily medium and heavy duty vehicles central to the operation of the freight economy in North America.
•International Fleet. Addresses the needs of businesses that utilize primarily light and medium duty vehicles central to the operation of the service economy outside of North America inclusive of our Fleet portfolios in Europe and Asia-Pacific. 
As of December 31, 2022, more than 18 million vehicles used our solutions for fleet management. 
Solution 
We believe our key source of differentiation in the Fleet Solutions segment is the enhanced data and controls we provide fleet operators based on our proprietary closed loop payments network. This proprietary closed-loop network enables us to capture rich data, deploy custom controls, and establish the economics between buyers and merchants. Our data and tools allow fleet owners and managers to control spend and limit fraud while optimizing their fleet operations. At the point-of-sale, we capture an array of information. Examples of information captured, which varies by type of customer, include the amount of the purchase, the driver, the vehicle, the odometer reading, the fuel or vehicle maintenance provider, and the items purchased. We provide standard and personalized information to customers through vehicle analysis reports, custom reports, and our websites. We also alert customers of unusual transactions or transactions that fall outside of pre-established parameters. Customers can access their account information through our website including account history and recent transactions and download the related details. In addition, fleet managers can elect to be notified when limits are exceeded in specified purchase categories, including limits on transactions within a time range and gallons per day. In the over-the-road space, we additionally offer fleets customizable payment solutions including real-time interactive and seamless interfaces delivering data integrity, alternative payment and money transfer options, comprehensive settlement solutions, real-time reports and analytics for compliance and cost-optimization and fuel reconciliation and mobile optimization tools.
In conjunction with the above, we offer our fleet customers the following additional products and services:
•Account activation and account retention: We provide activation and retention services that promote the adoption and use of our products.
•Authorization and billing inquiries and account maintenance: We handle authorization and billing questions, account changes, and other issues through our dedicated contact centers, which are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Self-service options are also provided through our online tools.
•Account management: We assign account managers to customers who operate large fleets. Our account managers have in-depth knowledge of both our programs and the objectives of the fleets they service.
•Credit and collections services: We extend short term credit in the majority of Fleet transactions. Related to this service we have developed proprietary account approval, underwriting, credit management, and collections programs.
•Merchant services: Our representatives work with fuel and vehicle maintenance providers to enroll these providers in our network, test all network technology, and provide training on our processes.
•Analytics solutions: We provide customers with access to analytics platforms and custom reporting tools targeted toward identifying cost savings opportunities and managing their fleet.
•Ancillary services and offerings: We provide a variety of ancillary services and tools to fleets to help them better manage expenses and capital requirements.
Building upon our historical ICE related fleet solutions, we are working on solutions we believe will ease the integration of EVs into mixed fleets. We believe we are uniquely positioned to help our customers transition to an expected mixed-fleet future. As fleet owners look to add vehicles powered by alternative energy sources, such as electric vehicles (EV), we are building on our deep experience in fleet and mobility in an attempt to develop and provide solutions to address specific customer needs, including charging, EV transition planning, and tools to successfully manage a mix of vehicle types ranging from connectivity to advanced route planning and carbon emissions reporting. 
Payment processing transactions are the primary revenue source in the Fleet Solutions segment. Revenue is earned based on a percentage of the aggregate dollar amount of the customer’s purchase, a fixed amount per transaction, or a 
Table of Contents

combination of both. In a typical domestic payment processing transaction for which we extend short-term credit to the fleet cardholder, we pay the merchant for the purchase price, less the fees we retain and record as revenue according to their specific merchant agreement, which generally occurs within ten days. Revenue from our WEX Europe Services and Go Fuel Card operations is primarily derived from the difference between the negotiated price of the fuel from the supplier and the price charged to the fleet customer. We collect the total purchase price from our North America and international fleet customers, typically within 30 days from the billing date. In our over-the-road fleet business, the amount of time between when we pay the merchants and collect from our customers is significantly reduced relative to a typical North America or International Fleet transaction. There are instances, primarily within our over-the-road business, in which WEX processes a fleet customer transaction with the merchant bearing the credit risk and collecting the receivable from the fleet.
In addition to revenue derived from payment processing transactions, we recognize account servicing revenue on fees charged to the cardholders, finance fee revenue on overdue accounts and other revenue on transaction processing revenue and miscellaneous other products and services.
Distribution
We market our fleet products and services both directly and indirectly to businesses and government agencies with fleets of commercial vehicles, including fleets of all sizes, and over-the-road, long haul fleets. Our direct product suite includes payment processing and transaction processing services, WEX branded fleet cards in North America, and Motorpass/Motorcharge branded fleet cards in Australia. Additionally, the WEX products and services are marketed under the EFS, EFS Transportation Services, T-Chek, and Fleet One network brands.
We also market our products and services using the WEX network indirectly through co-branded and private label relationships. With a co-branded relationship product, we market our products and services for, and in collaboration with, fuel providers and fleet management companies using their brand names and our logo on a co-branded fleet card. These companies seek to offer our payment processing and information management services as a component of their total offering to their fleet customers.
Our private label programs market our products and services for, and in collaboration with, fuel retailers, using only their brand names. The fuel retailers with which we have formed strategic relationships offer our payment processing and information management products and services to their fleet customers in order to establish and enhance customer loyalty. These fleets use these products and services to purchase fuel at locations of the fuel retailer with whom we have the private label relationship.
Competition
In general, our fleet solutions business competes with financial institutions that provide general payment services without the enhanced capabilities of our solution set. We also compete against similar more specialized offerings from Fleetcor, U.S. Bank Voyager, Radius Payment Solutions, DKV, and Edenred. We believe we compete favorably against these competitors through the combination of the breadth of our solution, the reach of our payments network, and our advantaged funding model through WEX Bank.
HEALTH AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT 
Overview
Our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment simplifies the business of administering and managing employee benefit plans. We provide SaaS software with embedded payment solutions and plan administration services for consumer-directed health benefits, COBRA accounts, and benefit enrollment and administration. In addition, we provide custodial and depository services for Health Savings Accounts. 
Solution
Our products simplify the process of navigating and managing employee benefits for plan administrators, employers, and plan participants and their families. Our solutions power a variety of benefit plans, including Health Savings Accounts, Flexible Spending Accounts, Health Reimbursement Arrangements, Lifestyle Spending Accounts, COBRA accounts, Wellness Incentives, Medicare Advantage supplemental benefits, commuter benefits, and other account-based benefit plans. We also provide the software that enables employees to choose and enroll in their benefits and manage those benefits throughout the plan year. In addition, we are an IRS-designated non-bank custodian of Health Savings Account assets. As of December 31, 2022, we were custodian to $4.5 billion in HSA assets, $1.1 billion of which were in investment funds at a third-party brokerage firm, and $3.45 billion of which were in cash. Of the $3.45 billion in cash, $1.4 billion is deposited with and managed by certain third-party depository partners and not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. The remaining balance 
Table of Contents

of $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 was deposited with and managed by WEX Bank and reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.
•Consumer-Directed Benefits. We provide a software platform for record-keeping and administration of account-based benefit plans, which reimburse eligible expenses incurred by plan participants and their eligible dependents. We also provide debit card processing services to enable immediate electronic reimbursement. 
•Non-bank Custodial Services. We provide non-bank custodial services for Health Savings Accounts, with consumer balances placed at a variety of bank depositories including WEX Bank. 
•COBRA Administration. We provide a software platform for the administration of COBRA plans. In addition, we collect and process consumer premium payments.
•Enrollment and benefits administration. We provide a software platform that guides employees through their benefits options and enables them to enroll in the plans and access and manage their benefits information throughout the year. 
•Administrative services. We provide a wide range of benefit plan administration services, including employer and participant service, claims administration, and reporting.
We simplify plan administration and management by providing a feature-rich software platform that automates and streamlines processes for stakeholders. In addition, through robust data analytics, we help administrators and employers understand consumer usage and engagement and benchmark against firms of similar size, geography, and industry. These same capabilities enable us to help consumers navigate their choices and make informed decisions about how to use their benefits. Our ability to gain rich insights from our expansive database enables us to provide personalized, relevant messages to consumers that connect with them where they are. We also enable administrators to compare their performance against their peers on dozens of metrics related to growth, operating efficiency, and consumer experience. Our products are designed to reduce friction, lower administrative costs, and provide a more elegant user experience. Participants can use our web portal and mobile app to access and manage their benefits at anytime from anywhere.
Our platform supports a multitude of benefit plan types, enables customization of plan design, and is extendable to power new benefit offerings in a dynamic market, consistent with the increasing importance of choice in employer benefit strategy. Our solutions are deployed flexibly, from software-only to full benefit administration, with a wide range of options in between. 
Our revenues derive primarily from three sources:
•Per participant per month fees charged for our software and administrative services.
•Interchange on debit cards used by plan participants and their dependents to pay for eligible expenses from their benefit plan.
•Interest on deposits and fees related to cash balances in Health Savings Accounts under custody at WEX.
Distribution
We distribute our software and payment solutions through a variety of partners, such as third-party administrators, financial institutions, payroll providers, and health plans. These partners use our software and payment solutions in their administration of employee benefit plans for their employer clients. Our team works with these partners to help them deploy go-to-market strategies and tactics to grow their business. In addition, we provide business process outsourcing of administrative services on behalf of certain partners.
We distribute full administrative services to the employer market directly and through brokers and consultants. Our solutions can be fully white-labeled, co-branded, or WEX-branded.
Our flexible distribution capabilities enhance our ability to penetrate our addressable markets through hundreds of partners as well as direct to employer. As of December 31, 2022 we had approximately 18.7 million SaaS accounts on our platform.
Competition
In our partner channel, we compete with other specialized providers of similar benefit solutions, such as Alegeus Technologies and DataPath, providers of core banking platforms, such as FIS, Fiserv, and Jack Henry, as well as proprietary technology solutions developed and maintained in-house by plan administrators. 
Table of Contents

In our direct channel, we compete with providers of consumer-directed benefit and COBRA administration as well as providers of benefit enrollment and administration software and services. Competitors in this segment include companies such as HealthEquity, Alight Technologies, Businessolver, and PayFlex. We believe we compete favorably against these competitors through the combination of the breadth of our solution, the feature-richness of our platform and the fact that our offerings can be deployed flexibly, from software-only to full benefit administration, with a wide range of options in between.
TRAVEL AND CORPORATE SOLUTIONS SEGMENT 
Overview 
Our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment focuses on the complex payment environment of global B2B payments. Our capabilities and solutions broadly fall into two categories:
•Embedded Payments. Our primary service offering is to enable customers to utilize our highly scalable and vertically integrated payments solutions to integrate into their own workflows. Customers access our capabilities primarily via our proprietary set of application programming interfaces (APIs). We combine wholly-owned and developed cloud-based technology along with our wholly-owned and operated global financial services capabilities, inclusive of WEX Bank and our various electronic money institutions around the world, to satisfy the commercial payments needs of our customer base. Our end customers are primarily using our services to create and use virtual credit cards to satisfy payment obligations in their business models. Customers for this solution include online travel agencies (OTAs), tour operators, and airlines, as well as non-travel customers such as financial technology firms that focus on spend management, accounts payable automation, insurance payments, and media payments. 
•Accounts Payable (AP) Automation and Spend Management. Built on top of our embedded payment capabilities, our AP Automation and Spend Management capabilities provide an enhanced user interface and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software integration points for organizations to manage their AP Automation and Spend Management functions. Our solutions in this space address corporations of all sizes and are sold direct to customers and also white-labeled by leading financial institutions who license our technology.
Solution
The Travel and Corporate Solutions segment allows businesses to centralize purchasing, simplify complex supply chain processes, and eliminate the paper check writing associated with traditional purchase order programs. It also enables technology companies and innovators across the globe to streamline their payment needs with a single, integrated technology and issuing partner.
At the core of our Travel and Corporate Solutions product set is a virtual card. Our virtual payments capability is used for transactions where no physical card is presented, including transactions that are increasingly completed online in a digitally connected world, but can also be used over the telephone, by mail, by email, or by fax. Each transaction is assigned a unique virtual card number (VCN) on either of the Mastercard or Visa networks, with a customized spend limit, expiration date, and various other purchase controls. These controls are in place to limit fraud and unauthorized spending. The unique VCN limits purchase amounts and tracks, settles, and reconciles purchases more easily, creating efficiencies and cost savings for our customers. Our virtual card solution combines (i) wholly-owned, end-to-end highly reliable technology, (ii) global currency capabilities with over 20 currencies active, and (iii) a wholly-owned global compliance and funding mechanism that allows WEX to be the issuer in addition to the payment processor. The use of a commercial virtual card is particularly appealing for its ability to easily reconcile, protect against fraud, provide chargeback protections, have global currency capabilities, and generate rebates through interchange economics.
We surround our core virtual card capabilities with a set of additional solution features to serve our customers. For our embedded payments solution, these capabilities include: (i) more than a dozen customized data fields that allow customers to tie together information such as invoice numbers, booking numbers, or purchase orders that enable industry-leading automated reporting and reconciliation benefits, (ii) a wide variety of different virtual card products with each of the card associations to optimize card acceptance and interchange yield, (iii) bank transfer and check issuance capabilities, (iv) modern, RESTful API, with associated, developer-focused explanation of use, and (v) the ability to optimize our systems and processes for bespoke solutions to large customer needs. For our AP automation and spend management solution, these capabilities include: (i) customizable integrations with different ERPs, (ii) enhanced AP data analysis and supplier enablement teams focused on increasing card acceptance, (iii) a wide variety of different virtual card products with each of the card associations to optimize card acceptance and interchange yield, (iv) bank transfer and check issuance capabilities allowing WEX to fulfill full AP file needs, and (v) different user interfaces oriented toward more simple small business needs as well as complex corporate needs.
Table of Contents

The vast majority of the segment’s revenue is derived from net interchange revenue, which is the gross interchange created by the issuance, authorization, settlement, and clearing of card network spend less rebates paid to customers. For our embedded payments offering used by leading technology companies across various industries, our net interchange rate is lower than that on our direct-to-corporate AP automation and spend management solution. Due to the largely fixed or semi-fixed cost nature of our solution, this segment benefits from a high variable margin contribution. A portion of revenue is derived from licensing fees we charge to partner financial institutions who white-label our AP automation and spend management solution. These financial institutions pay a technology fee as a percentage of the spend that the software enables them to issue.
Distribution
We market our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment products and services both directly and indirectly to new and existing customers in a variety of models.
Within our embedded payments solutions, we focus on direct sales to leading companies in the travel, fintech, insurance, consumer bill pay, and media verticals. Our customers’ product set is largely focused on aggregating and managing large amounts of payments where a commercial payment solution is required.
Within our AP Automation and Spend Management solutions, we focus on both direct sales to businesses as well as empowering financial institutions to serve their customers directly using our technology. Our direct sales team focuses on new sales directly to mid- and large- corporations where our custom ERP integration and supplier enablement functions help them turn their AP function from a highly manual and costly endeavor to a highly automated and revenue generating function. Our AP Automation and Spend Management solutions are also white labeled for financial institutions and we power some of the world’s leading financial institutions offering our white labeled technology to their corporate customers.
Competition
In general, WEX Travel and Corporate Solutions competes with financial institutions that provide general payment services without the enhanced capabilities of our solution set. Financial institutions, including but not limited to J.P. Morgan, Barclays, Capital One, and Citi, have access to technology solutions coupled with payment capabilities. We compete against specialized financial technology firms that are focused on delivering processing capabilities to the marketplace, such as I2C, Global Payments, and Marqeta, in partnership with partner banks who provide payments services, such as Cross River Bank, Celtic Bank, MVB Bank, Sutton Bank, or Silicon Valley Bank. We also compete with financial technology firms focused on accounts payable and spend management. We believe we compete favorably against these competitors through our wide geographic reach, deep payments expertise, enduring relationships, in-house technology and issuing capabilities, and our cloud-based proprietary technology stack. 
Our Strategy
As a continuing innovator in the payments and business technology industry, we believe WEX has significant experience in bringing and expanding our solutions to customers and markets. Our current strategy is a simplified articulation of our approach to growing our business and more specifically outlines how we expect to continue to meet the needs of an evolving landscape.
•Global Commerce Platform. A key foundation to the solutions we deliver to our customers is our platform, through which we deliver the solutions that serve our customers’ businesses. We continue to focus on differentiating ourselves through the global scale and reliability of our underlying infrastructure, and by anticipating our customers’ technology needs. We attempt to do this through integrating and continuously improving our payment and software technologies and by embedding intelligence, agility, and resiliency across the organization. 
•Personalized Solutions, Seamlessly Embedded. Through our platform, we deliver a suite of solutions specifically tailored to help our customers tackle some of their most complex pain points. With our deep industry expertise we try to differentiate ourselves from the market through customer-focused innovation, working alongside customers to ensure our solutions are relevant to their specific needs. We enhance the value we deliver by seamlessly embedding our solutions into our customers’ operations, which enables customers to access our capabilities through systems and interfaces they already use. 
•Insights that Power Success. The value of the solutions we provide is further amplified by the insights we deliver through the extensive data we maintain and the specialized expertise of our employees. Through these insights, we enable our customers to make better, more informed decisions, move more quickly and mitigate risk. We expect to continue to expand our use of AI, machine learning, and other innovative tools to ensure we can scale with our growth while managing risk both for ourselves and our customers. 
Table of Contents

While our strategy articulates the choices we are making to grow our business in the market and competitive landscape we play in, we expect those choices to deliver growth across five drivers:
•Win New Customers. We seek to drive organic growth across our segments by nurturing our customer relationships and ensuring we are a trusted strategic partner. Our support and service capabilities continue to enable us to grow with existing customers and win new customers.
•Grow Share of Wallet. We seek to expand our relevance and the value we deliver to our customers by growing the services we provide to them. Through our broad and diverse solution suite, we have a unique combination of solutions that can serve our customers in multiple areas. While we have proven cases of customers consuming our solutions across our product suite, there is continued opportunity to more deeply penetrate our customer base across all our solutions.
•Expand & Diversify Offerings. We continuously seek to identify, experiment and launch products in new solution spaces. As business models evolve, we seek to adapt our solution suite to stay relevant, and at the forefront of serving our customers’ needs.
•Deepen Global Presence. As a global business, we have an established footprint around the world. Through the scalability of our platform, we seek to leverage capabilities across geographies to continue growing our international business.
•Strategic M&A. Along with our organic growth, we expect to seek to achieve growth through strategic acquisitions, which brings further scale and diversification to our offerings.
Our Technology and Resources
We are driving a shift to platforms and data, enabling greater efficiency, faster innovation and better customer experiences. We believe that investment in technology is crucial to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position in the marketplace. Our technology infrastructure is supported by secure and redundant data centers and cloud services distributed globally, including locations in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Singapore. We continue to execute our Cloud First strategy, consolidating data centers and migrating computer workloads to public cloud service providers.
Our Information Security Program consists of a comprehensive set of policies, procedures, and guidelines across standard information security domains and all policies are reviewed and updated at least annually to meet applicable regulations. Our secure networks are designed to isolate our data from unauthorized access. We use secure protocols among all applications, and we restrict employee access to critical components. We are continually improving our technology to enhance customer experience and to increase efficiency and security. We also review technologies and services provided by others in order to maintain the high level of service expected by our customers and expect to continue to invest in our technology infrastructure.
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect the proprietary information and technology used in our business. We generally enter into agreements with clients, consultants, service providers and other partners, whether current or prospective, that contain provisions restricting use and disclosure of our proprietary information and technology. Operationally, we have implemented certain safeguards designed to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information and technology. We pursue registration and protection of certain trademarks in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate or plan to operate. We market our products and services using the WEX brand name globally, as well as other brand names such as FleetOne, EFS, and benefitexpress in the U.S. and eNett, Go Fuel Card and Motorpass internationally, in Europe, and in Australia, respectively. 
Regulation 
The Company is subject to a substantial number of laws and regulations, both in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, which apply to businesses offering financial technology services and payment cards to customers or processing or servicing for payment cards and related accounts. In addition, a substantial number of laws and regulations govern or affect WEX Bank, as an insured depository institution, and our operations related to the healthcare market. 
The laws and regulations that apply to the Company are often evolving and sometimes ambiguous or inconsistent, and the extent to which they apply to us is at times unclear. Failure to comply with regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services, and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines. The following, while not exhaustive, is a description of certain federal and state laws and 
Table of Contents

regulations in the United States, as well as foreign laws and regulations, that are applicable to our business, and therefore can materially affect our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position. In addition, the legal and regulatory framework governing our businesses is subject to ongoing revision, and changes in that framework could have a significant effect on us. 
Regulation - United States
General Regulation, Supervision and Examination of WEX Bank
As an industrial bank organized under the laws of the State of Utah that does not accept demand deposits that may be withdrawn by check or similar means, WEX Bank currently meets the criteria for exemption as an industrial bank from the definition of “bank” under the Bank Holding Company Act. As a result, WEX Inc. is generally not subject to the Bank Holding Company Act. WEX Bank is, however, subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI). Regular examinations are conducted and ratings are issued based on the FDIC’s examination policies and composite ratings framework. As regulatory bodies, the FDIC and the UDFI may issue informal or formal enforcement actions for violations of law, unsafe or unsound practices, and other actionable misconduct. Enforcement actions may include, but are not limited to, memoranda of understanding, consent orders, orders of restitution, and civil money penalties.
Restrictions on Intercompany Borrowings and Transactions 
Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (FRA) and the implementing regulations limit the extent to which the Company can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from or engage in other “covered transactions” with WEX Bank. These rules also require that the Company or any of its affiliates (as such term is defined in Section 23A of the FRA) engage in transactions with WEX Bank only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to WEX Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. “Covered transactions” include loans or extensions of credit, purchases of or investments in securities, purchases of assets, including assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, acceptance of securities as collateral for a loan or extension of credit, or the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit. Although the applicable rules do not serve as an outright ban on engaging in “covered transactions,” they do limit the amount of covered transactions WEX Bank may have with any one affiliate and with all affiliates in the aggregate. Furthermore, with certain exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by WEX Bank to the Company or its other affiliates must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from 100 percent to 130 percent of the amount of the loan or extension of credit, depending on the type of collateral. 
WEX Bank and WEX Inc. have entered into a master service agreement (the “Master Service Agreement”), which establishes the parameters of services between them with respect to the operation of the following: (i) a fleet card business for regional fleets; (ii) a fleet card business for the over-the-road freight carrier fleets; (iii) a corporate payments business; and (iv) a factoring business (collectively, the “Programs”). Certain of these Programs are funded by WEX Bank and others are funded by WEX Inc. 
WEX Bank performs certain services in support of these Programs, including funding, credit underwriting, credit expertise and compliance services. Whereas, WEX Inc. performs certain services in support of these programs, including sales and marketing, customer account, IT, merchant network establishment and maintenance, and administrative support services such as accounting, portfolio management, fraud, and suspicious activity management, human resources, compliance and legal, internal audit, vendor management, credit risk management, data analytics and model governance, and operations transformation. 
WEX Bank and WEX Inc. each receive monthly compensation for their respective services to the Programs funded by the other party. While the calculation fluctuates each month, the amount owed by WEX Bank to WEX Inc. is expected to always be significantly higher than the amount owed by WEX Inc. to WEX Bank. 
The Dodd-Frank Act, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission Act, and Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices and Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices Laws 
The Dodd-Frank Act granted the CFPB general authority to prevent covered persons or service providers from committing or engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices under federal law in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission Act, prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce for entities including WEX Inc. and its subsidiaries that are not directly regulated by CFPB. Additionally, all fifty states and the District of Columbia have their own laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts and practices, many of which also include a private right of action.
Table of Contents

The CFPB is also engaged in regulating the payments industry, including with respect to prepaid cards under Regulation E, which impose requirements on general-use prepaid cards, store gift cards and electronic gift cards. At this time, such regulation impacts only a very small number of products offered to WEX Inc. customers. Changes in offerings and/or expansion could lead to additional compliance obligations and expense for our business and our customers. From an enforcement perspective, the Dodd Frank Act also gives the state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws, expanding the sources of regulatory oversight. Relatedly, the Utah DFI is responsible for examining and supervising WEX Bank’s compliance with state consumer protection laws and regulations.
In addition, on July 1, 2022, WEX Bank became subject to provisions in the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, which provide that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will be regulated by the Federal Reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transaction. Payment network fees may not be used directly or indirectly to compensate card issuers in circumvention of the interchange transaction fee restrictions. Federal Reserve rules governing debit card interchange fees published in 2011 capped debit card interchange rates at $0.21 per transaction, subject to certain exemptions, plus an additional five basis points (0.0005) times the transaction’s value to reflect a portion of the issuer’s fraud losses plus, for qualifying issuing financial institutions, an additional $0.01 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs. As of the date of this filing, the applicability of the Durbin Amendment to any prepaid or debit card products we have is minimal.
The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. Compliance with derivatives regulations have added costs to our business, and any additional requirements, such as future registration requirements or increased regulation of derivative contracts, may add additional costs or may require us to change any fuel price, currency and interest rate hedging practices we may then use to comply with new regulatory requirements. Potential changes could also include clearing and execution methodology of our derivatives transactions. 
Brokered Deposits 
As of December 31, 2022, the most recent FDIC exam report categorized WEX Bank as “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. Section 29 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) restricts the acceptance of brokered deposits by an insured depository institution unless the institution is “well capitalized.” For insured depository institutions that are “less than well capitalized,” certain interest rate cap restrictions are imposed. 
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Regulations 
The applicable laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate impose significant anti-money laundering compliance and due diligence obligations on its local entities. We must verify the identity of customers, monitor and report unusual or suspicious account activity, as well as transactions involving amounts in excess of prescribed limits, and refrain from transacting with designated persons or in designated regions, in each case as required by the applicable laws and regulations (such as the Bank Secrecy Act and regulations of the United States Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service in the United States). Financial regulators have issued various implementing regulations and have made enforcement a high priority. We have implemented, and will continue to implement, measures designed to comply with these extensive and evolving requirements. For information regarding a consent order issued by the FDIC and UDFI relating to our Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering compliance program, see Item 1A - Risk Factors - “Compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations creates additional compliance costs and reputational risk.”
The U.S. government has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, foreign nationals and others. These sanctions, which are administered by OFAC, take many different forms but generally include one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (for example, property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. We have implemented, and will continue to implement, measures designed to comply with these sanctions. 
Healthcare Regulation
The federal and state governments in the U.S. continue to enact and consider many broad-based legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact various aspects of our health-related business. The plans that our partners and clients administer feature consumer accounts that pay for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by employees and qualified 
Table of Contents

dependents. These accounts include Consumer Directed Healthcare (CDH) accounts such as HSAs, FSAs and HRAs, as well as wellness incentives, commuter benefits, and other account-based arrangements. Most of these accounts are tax-advantaged under the appropriate law. 
Employers are continuing to use CDH approaches to manage the rate of increase in healthcare expenditures and to enable employees to make decisions about the use of their healthcare savings. CDH programs provide consumers with visibility into and control over payment for healthcare expenses.
The products that WEX Health’s software and payment solutions support are subject to various state and federal laws, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as “Health Care Reform”), and regulations promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and similar state laws and regulatory authorities. 
In addition to tax-related regulation, the Health Care Reform law imposes coverage standards affecting insured and self-insured health benefit plans that impact our current business model, including our relationships with current and future customers, producers and health care providers, products, services, processes and technology. Health Care Reform left many details to be established through regulations. Since the enactment of Health Care Reform, there has been persistent political pressure to significantly modify or repeal Health Care Reform and its associated implementing regulations. The 2017 Tax Act repealed certain provisions of Health Care Reform, including reducing to zero the tax penalty for individuals who decline to obtain Health Care Reform-compliant healthcare coverage. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of Health Care Reform, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Such challenges may lead to uncertainty and unpredictability in the U.S. health care market, which may materially affect the availability and cost of health coverage, the viability of health care providers and health benefit plans, and the proportion of persons in the U.S. who have health insurance; the distribution between privately funded and government funded health insurance; and the future demand for, and profitability of, the offerings of our health-related business under our current business model.
Privacy and Information Security Regulations
In connection with the processing of data, we frequently undertake or are subject to specific compliance obligations under privacy and data security-related laws.
Under the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, also referred to as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), and certain state laws, WEX Inc. and WEX Bank are required to maintain a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to consumer information. This requirement generally does not extend to information about companies or about individuals who obtain financial products or services for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes. In October 2021, the FTC updated the GLBA Safeguards Rule to specify new safeguards that financial institutions must include in their information security programs, including limits on who can access consumer data, requiring encryption to secure data, and requiring financial institutions to designate a single qualified individual to oversee their information security program and to report periodically to the entity’s board of directors or a senior officer in charge of information security. In addition, newly-proposed SEC cyber rules concerning public companies will, if adopted, impose additional disclosure and reporting obligations relating to cyber security management, risks and breach incidents. 
GLBA also requires us and WEX Bank to provide initial and annual privacy notices to customers that describe our information sharing practices. If WEX Inc. or WEX Bank intend to share nonpublic personal information about consumers with affiliates and/or nonaffiliated third parties, WEX Inc. and WEX Bank must provide customers with a notice and a reasonable period of time for each customer to “opt out” of any such disclosure. 
In addition to federal privacy laws with which we must comply, states also have adopted statutes, regulations and other measures, such as the California Consumer Protection Act, which as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) effective January 1, 2023 (together, the CCPA), and governs the collection, use and disclosure of personal information of California residents. Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah had each adopted their own comprehensive privacy laws. The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act took effect January 1, 2023, and the other three laws will each take effect during 2023. Several other states continue to consider privacy legislation. In some cases, data regulated by federal law (e.g., HIPAA and HITECH or the GLBA) is carved out of the scope of these state laws. But with respect to all other data, WEX Inc. and WEX Bank must monitor and seek to comply with individual state privacy laws in the conduct of our businesses.
In November 2021, U.S. federal banking regulators including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury, the Board of the Governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC issued a final rule effective April 1, 2022, that requires banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulators of any “computer-security incident” that rises to the level of a 
Table of Contents

“notification incident,” as soon as possible but no later than 36 hours after the banking organization determines that the incident has occurred.
WEX Inc. and WEX Bank are also subject to certain international privacy and data protection laws. For example, in Europe and the United Kingdom, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all companies processing data of EU residents, regardless of the company’s location. The GDPR imposes stringent privacy protections and provides EU and UK residents with extensive rights in their personal data (such as rights to delete, obtain access to, and correct their personal data) and requires the establishment of certain legitimate bases for collecting, using, and disclosing personal data. 
With respect to our healthcare services only, we have certain obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or “HIPAA” and its implementing regulations, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (together, HIPAA and HITECH), HIPAA and HITECH impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information, including breach notification and reporting requirements. An amendment to HITECH enacted in January 2021 requires consideration of a company’s implementation of recognized security standards in assessing administrative fines and penalties under the HIPAA security standards.
Email and Text Marketing Laws
We use direct email marketing and text-messaging to reach out to current or potential customers and therefore are subject to various statutes, regulations, and rulings, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM Act) and related Federal Communication Commission (FCC) orders. Several states have enacted additional, more restrictive and punitive laws regulating commercial email. Violations of these laws could result in enforcement actions, statutory fines and penalties, and class action litigation.
FACT Act
The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act and requires creditors to adopt identity theft prevention programs to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with covered accounts, which can include business accounts for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft.
Truth in Lending Act
The Truth in Lending Act, or TILA, was enacted as a consumer protection measure to increase consumer awareness of the cost of credit and to protect consumers from unauthorized charges or billing errors, and is implemented by the CFPB’s Regulation Z. Most provisions of TILA and Regulation Z apply only to the extension of consumer credit, but a limited number of provisions apply to commercial cards as well. For example, the limitation on liability for unauthorized use applies to business cards, although a business that acquires 10 or more credit cards for its personnel can agree by contract to more expansive liability.
Money Transmission and Payment Instrument Licensing Regulations
We are subject to various U.S. laws and regulations governing money transmission and the issuance and sale of payment instruments relating to certain aspects of our business. In the United States, most states license money transmitters and issuers of payment instruments. Through our subsidiaries, we are licensed in all states where required for business. Many states exercise authority over the operations of our services related to money transmission and payment instruments and, as part of this authority, subject us to periodic examinations, which may include a review of our compliance practices, policies and procedures, financial position and related records, privacy and data security policies and procedures, and other matters related to our business. Following these periodic examinations, state agencies can issue us findings and recommendations, prompting us to make changes to our operations and procedures.
As a licensee, we are subject to certain restrictions and requirements, including net worth and surety bond requirements, record keeping and reporting requirements, requirements for regulatory approval of controlling stockholders or direct and indirect changes of control of the licensee and certain other corporate events, and requirements to maintain certain levels of permissible investments in an amount equal to our outstanding payment obligations. Many states also require money transmitters and issuers of payment instruments to comply with federal and state anti-money laundering laws and regulations. 
In addition, non-banks that provide certain financial services are required to register with FinCEN as “money services businesses” (“MSBs”). The Company, through a subsidiary, is a registered MSB. As a result, we have established anti-money laundering compliance programs that include: (i) internal policies and controls; (ii) designation of a compliance officer; (iii) ongoing employee training; and (iv) an independent review function. We have developed and implemented compliance programs comprised of policies, procedures, systems and internal controls to monitor and address various legal requirements and developments.
Table of Contents

Government agencies may impose new or additional requirements on money transmission and sales of payment instruments, and we expect that compliance costs will increase in the future for our regulated subsidiaries.
Third Party Administration Licensing Regulations 
We are subject to various U.S. laws and regulations governing third party administration of employee benefit plans. In the U.S., most states license third party administrators. Many states exercise authority over the operations of our services related to third party administration of employee benefit plans and, as part of this authority, may subject us to periodic examinations, which may include a review of our policies and procedures, financial position and related records, and other matters related to our business. Following these periodic examinations, state agencies can issue us findings and recommendations, prompting us to make changes to our operations and procedures. 
As a licensee, we are subject to certain restrictions and requirements, which vary by state, including surety bond requirements and record keeping and reporting requirements. 
Escheatment Laws
We are subject to unclaimed or abandoned property state laws in the United States and in certain foreign countries that require us to transfer to certain government authorities the unclaimed property of others that we hold when that property has been unclaimed for a certain period of time. Moreover, we are subject to audit by state and foreign regulatory authorities with regard to our escheatment practices.
Restrictions on Dividends 
WEX Bank is subject to various regulatory requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums. Further, a banking regulator may determine that the payment of dividends would be inappropriate and could impose other conditions on the payment of dividends or even prohibit their payment. Further, WEX Bank may not pay a dividend if it is undercapitalized or would become undercapitalized as a result of paying the dividend. Utah law permits WEX Bank to pay dividends out of the net profits of the industrial bank after providing for all expenses, losses, interest, and taxes accrued or due, but if WEX Bank’s surplus account is less than 100 percent of its capital stock, WEX Bank must transfer up to 10 percent of its net profits to the surplus account prior to the payment of any dividends. 
Company Obligations to WEX Bank 
Any non-deposit obligation of WEX Bank to the Company is subordinate, in right of payment, to deposits and other indebtedness of WEX Bank. In the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of WEX Bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 
Restrictions on Ownership of WEX Inc. Common Stock 
WEX Bank, and therefore the Company, is subject to banking regulations that impose requirements on entities that might control WEX Bank through control of the Company. These requirements are discussed in Part I.Item 1A - Risk Factors, under the heading “Provisions in our charter documents, Delaware law, applicable banking laws and the Convertible Notes may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.” 
Anti-Bribery Regulations
WEX is a global business and is required to comply with anti-bribery and corruption laws in the jurisdictions it operates within, including but not limited to, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act, and the Brazil Clean Companies Act. The FCPA prohibits the payment of bribes to foreign government officials and political figures and includes anti-bribery provisions enforced by the Department of Justice and accounting provisions enforced by the SEC. The statute has a broad reach, covering all U.S. companies and citizens doing business abroad, among others, and defining a foreign official to include not only those holding public office but also local citizens affiliated with foreign government-run or -owned organizations. The statute also requires maintenance of appropriate books and records and maintenance of adequate internal controls to prevent and detect possible FCPA violations.
Non-Bank Custodian Regulations
As a U.S. Internal Revenue Service approved passive non-bank custodian for health savings accounts, we are subject to the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.408-2(e) (the “Treasury Regulations”), including the net worth, surety bond, recordkeeping, audit, and administration of fiduciary duties requirements, among other requirements. The Internal 
Table of Contents

Revenue Service exercises authority over our operations related to the non-bank custodian designation and, as part of this authority, subjects us to periodic examinations, which may include a review of our operational practices, policies and procedures, net worth and related records, and other matters related to our business. Following these periodic examinations, the Internal Revenue Service can issue us findings and recommendations, prompting us to make changes to our operations and procedures.

Human Capital
Talent Strategy
We believe that our employees, their well-being, and the culture in which they operate are core to our success as an organization and as an operating business. As of December 31, 2022, WEX Inc. and its subsidiaries had a substantial workforce of approximately 6,100 full time employees, of which approximately 4,900 were located in the United States. The remainder were located across fifteen countries. We believe that maintaining our anticipated growth and position as a leading global commerce platform that simplifies the business of running a business requires a strategy focused on attracting, developing, and retaining exceptional talent. The satisfaction, development, and well-being of our people has always been and will always be among our top priorities.
We promote employee career growth and development through comprehensive training programs, tools, and education, including online self-service learning platforms, professional development programs, leadership and mentoring programs, incentives to foster community and engagement, dedicated well-being campaigns, and personal financial counseling. Furthermore, we offer a sabbatical program that aims to rejuvenate and enrich curiosity and personal development. Through these programs, we strive to foster improved individual and business performance and employee engagement, satisfaction, and fulfillment. In 2022, WEX launched a global recognition program and digital platform, which allows employees to nominate each other for recognition. These acknowledgments are then incorporated into our annual performance management process, which factors into an employee’s annual total compensation package (or “Total Rewards”). WEX’s Total Rewards program includes salary, paid time off, 401(k) employer match, eligibility for cash bonuses and equity awards, as well as health and wellness, conception, career, social, community, and overall well-being benefits.
Our talent strategy includes a focus on retention and we regularly monitor employee turnover and engagement to identify opportunities to strengthen our approach to human capital management. During 2022, our overall voluntary turnover rate was approximately 17 percent, while our voluntary turnover among global employees who generally have managerial responsibilities (“leadership roles”) approximated 10 percent. We care deeply about employee engagement and satisfaction and capture employee feedback through an annual employee survey and pulse surveys throughout the year, which measure cultural and engagement indicators. We utilize the survey results to guide our decisions throughout the organization. During 2022, the results of our most recent annual survey indicated that approximately 82 percent of employees are engaged and intend to stay with WEX for at least the next 12 months following the survey. Approximately 88 percent of employees who responded to the survey reported that they feel supported by their manager, and employee well-being and safety was among our top scoring areas, consistently above benchmark and, we believe, a competitive advantage for WEX.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Another important part of our talent strategy, and a strategic priority central to our culture, embedded in our values, and integral to our business, is the cultivation of a diverse and inclusive culture. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 56 percent of our total global workforce were female and approximately 22 percent of our workforce in the U.S. were people of color. Females represented approximately 55 percent of our executive officers and 36 percent of our board of directors, while people of color represented approximately 10 percent of our U.S. executive officers and approximately 18 percent of our board of directors.
We embrace our employees’ unique experiences and backgrounds and their cultural influences and identities, which we believe enables a fully engaged and thriving workplace to drive our business forward. In 2022, we invested in a team fully-dedicated to creating and delivering a robust global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DE&I”) strategy. This team is focused on talent and culture but also partners with the business, our customers, and our suppliers. We appointed our first Chief Diversity 
Table of Contents

& Inclusion Officer, published our inaugural DE&I Report, and formalized supplier diversity with dedicated key hires within the procurement function with the intention of growing our program and maximizing our support to Tier 1 and Tier 2 diverse suppliers. In early 2022, the Company’s board of directors approved an aspirational set of DE&I goals with projected attainment by 2025. Specifically, these goals are intended to achieve gender parity in leadership roles and to increase employees of color in U.S. leadership roles by 50 percent, so that WEX is more representative of national demographics and the customers and partners we serve. In 2022, our global female representation in leadership roles was approximately 46 percent and U.S. employees of color representation in leadership roles was approximately 12 percent. WEX executive leadership annual goals and variable compensation are aligned to progress on these goals. In addition, to help move toward achievement of these goals and to advance our DE&I beliefs, we have taken steps including:
•Supporting our Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) as they aim to be a key element in creating belonging, celebrating cultural moments throughout the year, raising diversity awareness across the Company, and providing leadership development opportunities for under-represented groups. As of December 31, 2022, WEX had 9 ERGs with more than 1,600 employee members.
•Working to foster a culture of inclusion and provide our employees access to disrupting unconscious bias training, to focus on hiring diverse teams and foster an inclusive environment. 
•Committing to efforts focused on the retention of diverse and underrepresented talent, the tracking of training, and the measuring of diversity, equity, and inclusion program outcomes and our inclusive culture’s impact on business results and our corporate brand. In 2022, we piloted dedicated leadership development cohorts for our high-performing Black, Hispanic / LatinX, and Asian employees.
•Promoting inclusive hiring practices and conducting internal training for the talent acquisition team and hiring managers. WEX expanded its search for talent to include events such as the National Black MBA Conference, Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, Afrotech, and Women in Payments, to recruit diverse talent. WEX also forged new partnerships with organizations like YearUp / YuPro and on-boarded our first cohort of apprentices with non-traditional backgrounds. 
Health, Safety and Wellness
We are committed to a holistic wellbeing continuum of care for our employees, which goes beyond just physical, emotional, and behavioral safety, in order to ensure their wellbeing is at the forefront. WEX continues to model the learnings from the COVID-19 pandemic and remains mindful of the unique challenges it created for our workforce. As a result, we continue to champion flexible working for our workforce, as our employee surveys indicate an appreciation for the flexibility of being able to work remotely. Whether our employees are working in office or at home, our primary objective remains the same - to support a healthy and safe environment for our employees. We support their holistic health and overall safety by providing a wide range of resources and tools, including, but not be limited to, wealth management services, virtual ergonomic assessments, on demand fitness classes, access to a mindfulness app, telehealth services, time off options, and a family concierge along with mental, behavioral and emotional support for our employees and their immediate family members.
