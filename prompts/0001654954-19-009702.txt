  Description of the Business
  
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 24th, 2016. The Company was incorporated as Beliss Corp. however on June 26, 2019 the Company changed its name to Treasure & Shipwreck, Inc. by which we will refer as “TSR,” Our original general business plan was originally in the search engine optimization (“SEO”), Internet markeing and web development business. In January 2019, the Company entered into a series of transactions to gain control of a company named Southern Amusement Co. Inc. (“Southern Amusement”) a West Virginia based business. With that acquisition TSR was to acquire Southern Amusement as a wholly owned subsidiary company.
  
 Southern Amusement is an amusement machine provider located in Logan, West Virginia. The company had some 525 West Virginia Limited Video Lottery machines licensed under West Virginia law. The agreements called for delivery of all shares of Southern Amusement owned by John (J.D.) Brammer to be delivered in the transaction and be held by TSR A private agreement was entered by Ajay Rajendron for delivery of 2,700,000 shares of Beliss stock which he held of his 3,000,000 shares to JD. Brammer as part of the transaction became the CEO and sole director while Rajanedron resigned. Subsequently as set forth in the subsequent events, Brammer resigned and Craig A. Huffman was appointed when the Southern Amusement transaction did not occur.
  
 Importantly, under West Virginia law and regulation, control of any lottery related company, including ownership must be majority owned by a licensed and certified person by the Lottery Commission who must be a West Virginia resident. So in the transaction the control and majority control of Beliss as the owner of Southern, would have to be a West Virgina resident. Thus, the then Chief Operating Officer of Southern, John (J.D.) Brammer was appointed as CEO and director of Beliss, since he was licensed in Southern and was a West Virginia resident. After numerous legal consultations itwas decided that due to the West Virginia laws, J.D. Brammer would have to be the majority holder of Beliss. Thus after he was appointed as CEO and director, and Ajay Rajendran resigned as CEO and director, additional shares in the amount of 5,500,000 shares we issued to J.D. Brammer under restrictions, that included such shares would be surrendered if the transaction was not approved by the West Virginia Lotter Commission or if the shares of Southern could not be completely delivered. In such instance allinterest in such shares by J.D. Brammer would be surrendered, and such shares would go to an escrow agent for control until a future cancellation or other action occurred. One additional agreement was with Vicki Ferell, who was part owner of Sothern Amusement, so the agreement with Ferell was for her to deliver her shares of Southern Amusement to Beliss, in exchange for 571,429 shares of common stock. Such shares were issued to Vicki Ferrell.
  
 By April 2019, the shares of Southern Amusement were not delivered to Beliss after requests were made by counsel. It was then discovered that there was an undisclosed obligation on such shares which was not communicated to Beliss during the transaction. In exchange for a mutual release which Beliss believed such action was merely a mistake of fact, all such shares were abandoned by any interest by J.D. Brammer (the issued 5,500,000 shares), including the 2,700,000 private shares he had received from Ajay Rajendron which were also released to the control of the escrow agent and counsel for the Company. On April 28, 2019 Brammer resigned and the transaction was cancelled. At that point Craig A. Huffman (“Huffman”),counsel for the Company, became acting Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and sole Director of the Company. At the same time as the settlement agreement, Vicki Ferrell disclaimed any interest in the shares.
  
 While in the process of unwinding the transaction with the shareholders of Southern Amusement, the Company began to review various business opportunities. Subsequent to April 30, 2019 the Company elected to focus its business plan on entering the treasure recovery business by attempting to work with, partner with or hire experts in that industry (See Note 9 - Subsequent Events) under the experience of the new acting Chief Executive Officer and sole Director Craig A. Huffman (“Huffman”). Huffman possesses over 10 years of experience working with treasure companies, including their budgeting, due diligence, research issues, and gaining rights to suspected or known wreck sites using United States Admiralty law in United States Courts. As such, Huffman knew many of the experts and opportunities in the treasure industry and had a business plan for such operations to be implemented in the Company. In that realm, he pursued which is explained in Note 9, subsequent events.

      The Company
  
  Business Plan
  
 Although the Company has maintained its SEO, Internet marketing and web development business in order to satisfy any customers who made deposits for services related to this business, it is not currently focused on generating any new business in this sector.
  
 The Company is focusing its business plan on the treasure recovery business. We will be actively engaged in building out capital for first operations, which we expect shortly off Cape Romain South Carolina. We intend to support the recovery of treasure, which is an expansive term, by contracting outside parties to work on sites under the supervision of Dr. Spence. We may or may not choose to own vessels, versus using the contracted third parties vessels. We expect that we will have recovered items sold in different manners, as well as keeping some items as assets. There are also opportunities for both television and gaming development based on treasure salvage, pirates, etc. being pursued.
  
 In order to limit costs and expenses at the Company, we will primarily use subcontractors that are equipped with vessels, and other necessary search and recovery items, instead of buying such necessary equipment. We will then either make a split with them of the artifacts with such contractors, or pay for their services. In this way the Company will have a lower overhead and be able to select entities and persons with the right equipment and experience. The Company does have plans to have its own search and recovery vessels as well as necessary equipment, when feasible and in the best interest of certain projects.
  
 The term “treasure” as used here includes many things and is not just gold, silver, coins or jewels. “Wreckage,” “Artifacts,” and “Treasure” shall be used interchangeably to include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following types of items, regardless of their value or condition: passenger’s and crew’s possessions/effects, ship’s apparel, tackle, anchors, appurtenances, furnishings, fittings, portholes, bells, horns, hull, frames, engines, machinery, ballast, coal, ore, minerals, bottles, earthenware, china, hollowware, flatware, coins, medallions, bullion and cargo of any type whatsoever, as well as any other items that appear to have been manufactured, made, processed, altered, gathered, used, or lost by man. So it is an expansive list of what can encompass “treasure.”
  
  Revenue Sources
  
 TSR has numerous revenue routes. One is to keep many artifacts and treasure as assets, to be shown in a planned TSR location and museum. Second is sale of treasure and artifacts through certain auction houses and arranged product sales for coins, etc. Third is private collector sales. Fourth is road show and museum show fees. Finally, holding rights to television and future gaming development including an app development. The Company intends to keep a portion or substantial amounts of recovered items as assets of the Company in order to increase the value of the Company overall. The Company does not anticipate generating any revenues for the foreseeable future from the treasure recovery business.
 Industry
   
 The treasure search and recovery business is very specialized and requires special research and recovery abilities. The industry and opportunity is huge. For three hundred years, Spanish and others, pillaged the New World of treasure, shipping riches in thousands of ships over time back to Europe for the enjoyment and funding of those who never earned it. Along the way, an estimated one out of ten never made it home. Estimates of lost treasure from these ships in the Caribbean and the coast of Florida alone is conservatively placed at $ 60 Billion The number of wrecks that have been found is infinitesimal compared to those lost.
 Current Site- Cape Romain, South Carolina
  
 Cape Romain shipwrecks site is a five mile radius site under U.S. Admiralty Order off the coast of South Carolina, and outside State waters. Therefore, all that is found in the area is the property of TSR/Beliss and our partner, Sea Research Society. This is a very large cluster of shipwrecks. Most have yet to be identified. They seem to include Spanish, French, English, German, and American merchant ships, slavers, and even privateers, which were lost over several hundred years. Vessels were found around this shoal sometimes with less than six feet of water over it at low tide, even though it is located mere miles from the nearest shore. In fact, it was the un-expected shallowness of the shoal that repeatedly caused ships to be lost around it. One of the ships, a steamer wrecked in the late 1800s, had been heavily involved in the international smuggling of money and arms for a series of revolutions on the island of Hispaniola. All of this protected by United States Government Court Order making E. Lee Spence as the owner of all wrecks in the area. Under our work and agreement with Dr. Spence we are his partner on such site for an equal division of all artifacts found.
 Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
  
 We currently do not have any patents or trademarks; and we are not party to any license, franchise, concession, or royalty agreements or any labor contracts.

  Competition
   
 The treasure recovery business is not extremely competitive in traditional business sense. With over three million estimated shipwrecks around the world, and thousands of valuable wrecks, finding such wrecks outside the context of a competitor is not difficult. There are always other wreck sites to go after, explore and potentially recover artifacts and treasure. And when such wreck site is found, then an admiralty claim is filed in U.S. Federal Court to gain ownership of the wreck and site. There are other treasure companies, but their only critical effect may be attempts to gain funders from the same pool of persons and entities.
 Government Regulation
   
 We are not currently subject to direct federal, state or local regulation other than regulations applicable to businesses generally or directly applicable to electronic commerce. However, when we enter into recovery of shipwreck salvage, when inside statewaters, we may be subject to some regulations which require certain permitting. The same would apply for waters in foreign countries if we choose to do projects there. Our business plan is to stay out of state and other nations waters so that we are not subject to such wreck salvager permitting. Otherwise we may, when we have ships be subject to some regulations regarding ship operations.
 Research and Development Activities and Costs
  
 We have not incurred any expenses and have spent no time on specialized research and development activities and have no plans to undertake any research or development in the future. Any research done by the Company will be historical in nature based on shipwreck records in libraries and collections, and are not normal research and development costs incurred by the traditional product or technology company.
 Compliance with Environmental Laws
  
 There are no operable environmental laws for the areas of operations planned which are outside the three limit of state waters. If we were to operate within the three mile limit in state waters anywhere in the United States, then there could be environmental issues that could arise with certain state agencies.
 Employees
  
 Other than our sole officer and director, we have no full-time or part-time employees of our business or operations who are employed at will by the TSR. Mr. Huffman currently dedicates as much time as needed to our business affairs. We plan to hire experienced employees in the future when we have sufficient revenues. Our CEO and director’s current training allows him to provide the services we list in this report. Dr. Spence as Chief Operating Officer will be working as an independent consultant in such capacity as needed for the Company’s efforts.
 Description of Property
  
 Our offices are currently located at 1501 Lake Ave. S.E. Largo, Florida, which is the location of an office held by Craig A. Huffman, our Acting CEO. Mr. Huffman does not charge rent for such office use and there is no lease. The mailing address for the Company is 13046 Racetrack Road, #234, Tampa, Florida 33626. Management believes that new office space will be found nearer the center of operations in South Carolina or Florida.
