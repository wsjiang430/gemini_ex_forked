ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 Blackstone is a leading global alternative asset manager, with Total Assets Under Management of $472.2 billion as of December 31, 2018. As stewards of public funds, we look to drive outstanding results for our investors and clients by deploying capital and ideas to help businesses succeed and grow. Our alternative asset management businesses include investment vehicles focused on real estate, private equity, hedge fund solutions, credit, secondary funds of funds and multi-asset class strategies. We also provide capital markets services. 
 All of Blackstones businesses use a solutions oriented approach to drive better performance. We believe our scale, diversified business, long track record of investment performance, rigorous investment approach and strong client relationships, position us to continue to perform well in a variety of market conditions, expand our assets under management and add complementary businesses. 
 Two of our primary limited partner constituencies are public and corporate pension funds. As a result, to the extent our funds perform well, it supports a better retirement for millions of pensioners. 
 In addition, because we are a global firm with a footprint on nearly every continent, our investments can make a difference around the world. We are committed to making our portfolio companies stronger in ways that can have positive impacts on local economies. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 2,615 people, including our 147 senior managing directors, at our headquarters in New York and around the world. We believe hiring, training and retaining talented individuals coupled with our rigorous investment process has supported our excellent investment record over many years. This record in turn has allowed us to successfully and repeatedly raise additional assets from an increasingly wide variety of sophisticated investors. 
 Business Segments 
 Our four business segments are: (a) Real Estate, (b) Private Equity, (c) Hedge Fund Solutions and (d) Credit. 
 Information about our business segments should be read together with Part II. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the historical financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Real Estate 
 Our Real Estate group was founded in 1991 and is one of the largest real estate investment managers in the world, with $136.2 billion of Total Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2018. We operate as one globally integrated business with 545 employees and investments in North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America. Our Real Estate investment team seeks to establish a differentiated view and capitalizes on our scale and proprietary information advantages to invest with conviction and generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our investors over the long-term. 
 Our Blackstone Real Estate Partners funds are geographically diversified and target a broad range of opportunistic real estate and real estate related investments. The BREP funds include global funds as well as funds focused specifically on Europe or Asia investments. We seek to acquire high quality, well-located yet undermanaged assets at an attractive basis, address any property or business issues through active asset management and sell the assets once our business plan is accomplished. BREP has made significant investments in hotels, office buildings, industrial assets, residential and shopping centers, as well as a variety of real estate operating companies.

 We launched Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies, our real estate debt platform, in 2008. Our BREDS vehicles target debt investment opportunities collateralized by commercial real estate. BREDS invests in both public and private markets, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. BREDS scale and investment mandates enable it to provide a variety of lending options for our borrowers and investment options for our investors, including mezzanine loans, senior loans and liquid securities. The BREDS platform includes a number of high yield and high grade real estate debt funds, liquid real estate debt funds and Blackstone Mortgage Trust, Inc., a NYSE-listed REIT. 
 We launched our core+ real estate business, Blackstone Property Partners, in 2013 and have assembled a global portfolio of high quality core+ investments across the U.S., Europe and Asia. We manage several core+ real estate funds, which target substantially stabilized assets in prime markets with a focus on industrial, multifamily, office and retail assets. The funds generate returns through both current income and value appreciation over the long-term. 
 We launched Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, a non-exchange traded REIT, in 2017. BREIT is focused on investing primarily in stabilized income-oriented commercial real estate in the United States. 
 For more information concerning the revenues and fees we derive from our Real Estate segment, see  Incentive Arrangements / Fee Structure in this Item 1. 
 Private Equity 
 Our Private Equity segment, established in 1987, is a global business with approximately 445 employees managing $130.7 billion of Total Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2018. We are a world leader in private equity investing, having managed seven general private equity funds, three sector-focused funds and one geographically-focused fund since we established the business. We are focused on identifying, managing and creating lasting value for our investors. Our Private Equity segment includes our corporate private equity business, which consists of Blackstone Capital Partners, our flagship private equity funds, our sector-focused funds, including our energy-focused funds (Blackstone Energy Partners) and our Asia-focused fund. The principal component of our Private Equity segment is our corporate private equity business. Our corporate private equity business consists of: (a) our flagship private equity funds, Blackstone Capital Partners, (b) our sector-focused funds, including our energy-focused funds, Blackstone Energy Partners, (c) our Asia-focused fund and (d) our core private equity fund, Blackstone Core Equity Partners, which targets control-oriented investments in high quality companies with durable businesses and seeks to offer a lower level of risk and a longer hold period than traditional private equity. In addition, our Private Equity segment includes (a) our opportunistic investment platform that invests globally across asset classes, industries and geographies, Blackstone Tactical Opportunities, (b) our secondary fund of funds business, Strategic Partners Fund Solutions, (c) our infrastructure-focused funds, Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, (d) our life sciences private investment platform, Blackstone Life Sciences, (e) our multi-asset investment program for eligible high net worth investors offering exposure to certain of Blackstones key illiquid investment strategies through a single commitment, Blackstone Total Alternatives Solutions and (f) our capital markets services business, Blackstone Capital Markets. 
 Our corporate private equity business pursues transactions throughout the world across a variety of transaction types, including large buyouts, mid-cap buyouts, buy and build platforms (which involve multiple acquisitions behind a single management team and platform) and growth equity/development projects (which involve significant minority investments in operating companies and greenfield development projects in energy and power). Our private equity businesss investment strategies and core themes continually evolve, in anticipation of, or in response to, changes in the global economy, local markets, regulation, capital flows and geopolitical trends. We seek to construct a differentiated portfolio of investments with a well-defined, interventionist, post-acquisition value creation strategy. Similarly, we seek investments that can generate strong unlevered returns regardless of entry or exit cycle timing. Finally, when we can identify sectors or geographies in which the demand for capital greatly exceeds the readily available supply, our corporate private equity business seeks to make investments at or near book value where it can create goodwill or franchise value through post-acquisition actions. 
 
6 


 Tactical Opportunities is our opportunistic investment platform. The Tactical Opportunities mandate invests globally across asset classes, industries and geographies, seeking to identify and execute on attractive, differentiated investment opportunities. As part of the strategy, the team leverages the intellectual capital across Blackstones various businesses while continuously optimizing its approach in the face of ever-changing market conditions. Tactical Opportunities flexible mandate leads to a diversified portfolio of investments across a broad range of structures, including private and public securities and instruments and where the underlying exposure may be to equity or debt. 
 Strategic Partners, our secondary fund of funds business was established in 2000 and acquired by Blackstone in 2013. Strategic Partners is a total fund solutions provider. As a secondary investor it acquires interests in high quality private funds from original holders seeking liquidity. Strategic Partners focuses on a range of opportunities in underlying funds such as leveraged buyout, real estate, infrastructure, venture and growth capital, credit and other types of funds, as well as co-investments alongside financial sponsors. Strategic Partners also provides investment advisory services to separately managed account clients investing in primary and secondary investments in private funds and co-investments.
Blackstone Infrastructure Partners was established in 2017 and targets a diversified mix of core+, core and public-private partnership investments across the energy infrastructure, transportation, water and waste and communications sectors, with a primary focus in North America. BIP applies a disciplined, value-added, operationally intensive investment approach to investments in the infrastructure asset class. BIP expects to generate returns through both current income and value appreciation over the long-term. 
 For more information concerning the revenues and fees we derive from our Private Equity segment, see  Incentive Arrangements / Fee Structure in this Item 1. 
 Hedge Fund Solutions 
 The largest component of our Hedge Fund Solutions segment is Blackstone Alternative Asset Management (BAAM). BAAM is the worlds largest discretionary allocator to hedge funds, managing a broad range of commingled and customized hedge fund of fund solutions since its inception in 1990. The Hedge Fund Solution segment also includes investment platforms that seed new hedge fund businesses, purchase minority ownership interests in more established hedge funds, invest in special situations opportunities, create alternative solutions in the form of mutual funds and Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS) and invest directly. Working with our clients over the past 20 plus years, our Hedge Fund Solutions group has developed into a leading manager of institutional funds with approximately 265 employees managing $77.8 billion of Total Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2018. Hedge Fund Solutions overall investment philosophy is to protect and grow investors assets through both commingled and custom-tailored investment strategies designed to deliver compelling risk-adjusted returns and mitigate risk. Diversification, risk management, due diligence and a focus on downside protection are key tenets of our approach. For more information concerning the revenues and fees we derive from our Hedge Fund Solutions segment, see  Incentive Arrangements / Fee Structure in this Item 1. 
Credit 
 Our Credit segment, with $127.5 billion of Total Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2018 and approximately 410 employees, consists principally of GSO Capital Partners LP (GSO). GSO is one of the largest credit alternative asset managers in the world and is the largest manager of CLOs globally. The investment portfolios of the funds we manage or sub-advise predominantly consist of loans and securities of non-investment grade companies spread across the capital structure including senior debt, subordinated debt, preferred stock and common equity. 
 The GSO business is organized into three overarching strategies: performing credit, distressed and long only. Our performing credit strategies include mezzanine lending funds, middle market direct lending funds and other 
 
7 


  performing credit strategy funds. Our distressed strategies include credit alpha strategies, stressed/distressed funds and energy strategies. GSOs long only strategies consist of CLOs, closed end funds, open ended funds and separately managed accounts. 
 In addition, our Credit segment includes our publicly traded master limited partnership (MLP) investment platform, which is managed by Harvest Fund Advisors LLC (Harvest). Harvest, which was founded in 2005 and subsequently acquired by Blackstone in 2017, primarily invests capital raised from institutional investors in separately managed accounts and pooled vehicles, investing in publicly traded MLPs holding primarily midstream energy assets in the U.S. 
 Our Credit segment also includes our insurer-focused platform, BIS. BIS partners with insurers to deliver customizable and diversified portfolios of Blackstone products across asset classes, as well as the option for full management of insurance companies investment portfolios. 
 Pátria Investments 
 On October 1, 2010, we purchased a 40% equity interest in Pátria Investments Limited and Pátria Investimentos Ltda. (collectively, Pátria). Pátria is a leading alternative asset manager in Latin America that was founded in 1988. As of December 31, 2018, Pátrias alternative asset management businesses had $13.2 billion in assets under management, including the management of private equity funds ($7.5 billion), infrastructure funds ($4.2 billion), real estate funds ($1.0 billion) and new initiatives ($440.4 million). Pátria has approximately 275 employees and is led by a group of three managing partners. Our investment in Pátria is a minority, non-controlling investment, which we record using the equity method of accounting. We have representatives on Pátrias board of directors in proportion to our ownership, but we do not control the day-to-day management of the firm or the investment decisions of their funds, all of which continues to reside with the local Brazilian partners. 
Investment Process and Risk Management 
 We maintain a rigorous investment process across all of our funds, accounts and other investment vehicles. Each fund, account or other vehicle has investment policies and procedures that generally contain requirements and limitations for investments, such as limitations relating to the amount that will be invested in any one investment and the types of industries or geographic regions in which the fund, account or other vehicle will invest, as well as limitations required by law. The investment committees of our businesses review and evaluate investment opportunities in a framework that includes a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the key risks of each investment. 
Real Estate Funds 
 Our Real Estate investment professionals are responsible for selecting, evaluating, structuring, diligencing, negotiating, executing, managing and exiting investments, as well as pursuing operational improvements and value creation. After an initial screening process during which the investment team evaluates general business and market investment criteria, the investment team conducts a more detailed underwriting, evaluation and diligence of the investment. The regional investment teams meet once a week to discuss investments under various stages of review. Our real estate operation has one global investment review process to consider and approve all investments. The relevant team of investment professionals (i.e., the deal team) generally submits a proposed transaction for review and approval by a review or investment committee depending on the size, region and type of investment. Our investment and review committees are composed of senior leaders of the firm and select senior managing directors of our Real Estate segment, including individuals based on the location and sector of the proposed transaction. Considerations that the investment and review committees take into account when evaluating an investment include the quality of the business or asset in which the fund proposes to invest, likely exit strategies, factors that could reduce the value of a business or asset upon sale, environmental, social and governance, or ESG, issues and macroeconomic trends in the relevant geographic region. 
 
8 


 The investment professionals of our real estate funds are responsible for monitoring an investment once it is made and for making recommendations with respect to exiting an investment. In addition to members of a deal team and our dedicated asset management team, which is responsible for assisting in enhancing portfolio companies operations and value, our real estate professionals meet regularly to discuss new significant investment opportunities, reinvestment opportunities within the current portfolio and potential dispositions. 
 Private Equity Funds 
 Our private equity investment professionals are responsible for selecting, evaluating, structuring, diligencing, negotiating, executing, managing and exiting investments, as well as pursuing operational improvements and value creation. After an initial selection, evaluation and diligence process, the relevant team of investment professionals (i.e., the deal team) submits a proposed transaction for review by the review committee of our private equity funds. Review committee meetings are led by an executive committee of several senior managing directors of our Private Equity segment. Following assimilation of the review committees input and its decision to proceed, the proposed investment is vetted by the investment committee, similar to that described under  Real Estate Funds. The investment committee is responsible for approving all investment decisions made on behalf of our private equity funds. Considerations that the investment committee takes into account when evaluating an investment include the quality of a business in which the fund proposes to invest and the quality of the management team of such business, expected levered and unlevered returns of the investment in a variety of investment scenarios, the ability of the company in which the investment is made to service debt in a range of economic and interest rate environments, environmental, social and governance, or ESG, issues and macroeconomic trends in the relevant geographic region. 
 The investment professionals of our private equity funds are responsible for monitoring an investment once it is made and for making recommendations with respect to exiting an investment. In addition to members of a deal team and our portfolio operations group, which is responsible for assisting in enhancing portfolio companies operations and value, all professionals in our private equity business meet several times each year to review the performance of the funds portfolio companies. 
 Tactical Opportunities has a substantially similar process to the private equity process described above, with the exception of the composition of the review and investment committee. The Tactical Opportunities review committee is comprised of senior managing directors of the Tactical Opportunities business and a senior managing director of our private equity business, and the investment committee is comprised of senior leaders of the firm and key leaders of each business unit. 
 Strategic Partners is a total fund solutions provider and focuses on acquiring, among other things, secondary interests in private funds from original holders seeking liquidity. After rigorous, highly analytical investment due diligence, the Strategic Partners investment professionals present a proposed transaction to the groups investment committee. The Strategic Partners investment committee is comprised of senior members of our Strategic Partners business. The investment committee meets to review, and decide whether to approve or deny, transactions. The investment professionals on the Strategic Partners team are responsible for monitoring each investment once it is made. 
 BIP has one global investment committee, similar to that described under  Real Estate Funds, and applies uniform standards regardless of geography or sector. The BIP review committee and investment committee are each comprised of Mr. Schwarzman and other senior leaders of the firm, the Global Head of Infrastructure and key leaders of our private equity and credit-focused businesses. 
 Hedge Fund Solutions 
 Before deciding to invest in a new hedge fund or with a new hedge fund manager, our Hedge Fund Solutions team conducts due diligence, including an on-site front office review of the funds/managers performance, investment terms, investment strategy and investment personnel, a back office review of the funds/managers 
 
9 


  operations, processes, risk management and internal controls, industry reference checks and a legal review of the investment structures and legal documents. For our direct investing platform, our Hedge Fund Solutions team conducts due diligence on the underlying investment. In each case, once initial due diligence procedures are completed and the investment and other professionals are satisfied with the results of the review, the team typically will present the potential investment to the relevant Hedge Fund Solutions investment committee. The investment committees are comprised of relevant senior managing directors and senior investment personnel. Existing investments are reviewed and monitored on a regular basis. 
 Credit 
 Each of our credit-focused funds has an investment committee similar to that described under  Real Estate Funds. The investment committees for the credit-focused funds include senior members of the respective investment teams associated with each credit-focused fund. The investment committees review potential transactions, provide input regarding the scope of due diligence and approve recommended investments and dispositions, subject to delineated exceptions set forth in the funds investment committee charters. 
 The investment decisions for the customized credit long only clients and other clients whose portfolios are actively traded, including those advised by BIS, are made or reviewed by separate investment committees, each of which is composed of certain of the groups respective senior managing directors, managing directors and other investment professionals. The investment team is staffed by professionals within research, portfolio management, trading and capital formation to ensure active management of the portfolios. Industry-focused research analysts provide the committee with a formal and comprehensive review of new investment recommendations. Our portfolio managers and trading professionals discuss technical aspects of the recommendation as well as the risks associated with the overall portfolio composition with investment analysts. Investments are subject to predetermined periodic reviews to assess their continued fit within the funds. Our research team monitors the operating performance of the underlying issuers, while portfolio managers, in concert with our traders, focus on optimizing asset composition to maximize value for our investors. 
 Harvest has an investment committee that is comprised of Harvest investment professionals, including senior members of the investment team. The investment committee oversees Harvests portfolio of investments and manages all security selection decisions for Harvests funds and separately managed accounts. 
 Structure and Operation of Our Investment Vehicles 
 Our private investment funds are generally organized as limited partnerships with respect to U.S. domiciled vehicles and limited partnership, limited liability and other similar entities with respect to non-U.S. domiciled vehicles. In the case of our separately managed accounts, the investor, rather than us, generally controls the investment vehicle that holds or has custody of the investments we advise the vehicle to make. We conduct the sponsorship and management of our carry funds and other similar vehicles primarily through a partnership structure in which limited partnerships organized by us accept commitments and/or funds for investment from institutional investors and, to a more limited extent, high net worth individuals. Such commitments are generally drawn down from investors on an as-needed basis to fund investments (or for other permitted purposes) over a specified term. With the exception of certain core+ real estate and certain real estate debt funds, our private equity and private real estate funds are commitment structured funds. For certain BPP and BREDS funds, all or a portion of the committed capital is funded on or promptly after the investors subscription date and cash proceeds resulting from the disposition of investments can be reused indefinitely for further investment, subject to certain investor withdrawal rights. Our real estate business also includes BXMT, BREIT, and a registered investment company complex, each of which is externally managed or advised by Blackstone-owned entities. Our credit-focused funds are generally commitment structured funds or open ended where the investors capital is fully funded into the fund upon or soon after the subscription for interests in the fund. The CLO vehicles we manage are structured investment vehicles that are generally private companies with limited liability. Most of our funds of hedge funds as well as our hedge funds 
 
10 


  are structured as funds where the investors capital is fully funded into the fund upon the subscription for interests in the fund. BIS is generally structured around separately managed accounts. 
 Our investment funds, separately managed accounts and other vehicles not domiciled in the European Economic Area (EEA) are generally advised by a Blackstone entity serving as investment adviser that is registered under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or Advisers Act. For our investment funds, separately managed accounts and other vehicles domiciled in the EEA, a Blackstone entity domiciled in the EEA generally serves as external alternative investment fund manager (AIFM), and the AIFM typically delegates its portfolio management function to a Blackstone-affiliated investment advisor registered under the Advisers Act. Substantially all of the day-to-day operations of each investment vehicle are typically carried out by the Blackstone entity serving as investment adviser or AIFM, as applicable, pursuant to an investment advisory, investment management, AIFM or other similar agreement. Generally, the material terms of our investment advisory and AIFM agreements, as applicable, relate to the scope of services to be rendered by the investment adviser or the AIFM to the applicable vehicle, the calculation of management fees to be borne by investors in our investment vehicles, the calculation of and the manner and extent to which other fees received by the investment adviser or the AIFM, as applicable, from funds or fund portfolio companies serve to offset or reduce the management fees payable by investors in our investment vehicles and certain rights of termination with respect to our investment advisory and AIFM agreements. With the exception of the registered funds described below, the investment vehicles themselves do not generally register as investment companies under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, or 1940 Act, in reliance on the statutory exemptions provided by Section 3(c)(7), Section 7(d) or Section 3(c)(5)(C) thereof or, typically in the case of vehicles formed prior to 1997, Section 3(c)(1) thereof. Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act exempts from its registration requirements investment vehicles privately placed in the United States whose securities are owned exclusively by persons who, at the time of acquisition of such securities, are qualified purchasers as defined under the 1940 Act. Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act exempts from its registration requirements certain companies engaged primarily in investment in mortgages and other liens or investments in real estate. Section 3(c)(1) of the 1940 Act exempts from its registration requirements privately placed investment vehicles whose securities are beneficially owned by not more than 100 persons. In addition, under current interpretations of the SEC, Section 7(d) of the 1940 Act exempts from registration any non-U.S. investment vehicle all of whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned either by non-U.S. residents or by U.S. residents that are qualified purchasers. BXMT is externally managed by a Blackstone-owned entity pursuant to a management agreement, conducts its operations in a manner that allows it to maintain its REIT qualification and also avail itself of the statutory exemption provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act. BREIT is externally advised by a Blackstone-owned entity pursuant to an advisory agreement, conducts its operations in a manner that allows it to maintain its REIT qualification and also avails itself of the statutory exemption provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act. 
 In some cases, one or more of our investment advisers, including within GSO, BAAM and BREDS advisers, advises or sub-advises funds registered under the 1940 Act. In addition to having an investment adviser, each investment fund that is a limited partnership, or partnership fund, also has a general partner that generally makes all operational and investment decisions, including the making, monitoring and disposing of investments. The limited partners of the partnership funds generally take no part in the conduct or control of the business of the investment funds, have no right or authority to act for or bind the investment funds and have no influence over the voting or disposition of the securities or other assets held by the investment funds. With the exception of certain of our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, certain credit-focused and real estate debt funds, and other funds or separately managed accounts for the benefit of one or more specified investors, third party investors in our funds have the right to remove the general partner of the fund or to accelerate the termination of the investment fund without cause by a simple majority vote. In addition, the governing agreements of our investment funds provide that in the event certain key persons in our investment funds do not meet specified time commitments with regard to managing the fund, then (a) investors in certain funds have the right to vote to terminate the investment period by a specified percentage (including, in certain cases a simple majority) vote in accordance with specified procedures, or accelerate the withdrawal of their capital on an investor-by-investor basis, or (b) the funds investment period will automatically terminate and a specified percentage (including, in certain cases a simple majority) in accordance with specified procedures is required to restart it. In addition, the governing agreements of some of our investment funds 
 
11 


  provide that investors have the right to terminate, for any reason, the investment period by a vote of 75% of the investors in such fund. 
 Incentive Arrangements / Fee Structure 
 Management Fees 
 The following describes the management fees received by the Blackstone investment advisers and AIFM. 
 

 | The investment adviser of each of our non-EEA domiciled carry funds and the AIFM of each of our EEA domiciled carry funds generally receives an annual management fee based upon a percentage of the funds capital commitments, invested capital and/or undeployed capital during the investment period and the funds invested capital or investment fair value after the investment period, except that the investment adviser or AIFM to certain of our credit-focused carry/incentive funds, BPP funds and BCEP receive an annual management fee that is based upon a percentage of invested capital or net asset value throughout the term of the fund. These management fees are payable on a regular basis (typically quarterly) in the contractually prescribed amounts over the life of the fund. Depending on the base upon which management fees are calculated, negative performance of one or more investments in the fund may reduce the total management fee paid, but not the fee rate.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The investment adviser of each of our funds that are structured like hedge funds, or of our funds of hedge funds, registered mutual funds and separately managed accounts that invest in hedge funds, generally receives an annual management fee that is based upon a percentage of the funds or accounts net asset value. These management fees are also payable on a regular basis (typically quarterly). These funds generally provide investors liquidity through annual, semi-annual, quarterly or monthly withdrawal or redemption rights, in some cases following the expiration of a specified period of time when capital may not be withdrawn. Daily redemption rights are generally provided in the case of registered mutual funds. The amount of management fees to which the investment adviser is entitled with respect thereto will proportionately increase as the net asset value of each investors capital account grows and will proportionately decrease as the net asset value of each investors capital account decreases. In addition, to the extent the mandate of our funds is to invest capital in third party managed hedge funds, as is the case with our funds of hedge funds, our funds will be required to pay management fees to such third party managers, which typically are borne by investors in such investment vehicles.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The investment adviser of each of our CLOs typically receives annual management fees based upon a percentage of each funds assets, subject to certain performance measures related to the underlying assets the vehicle owns, and additional management fees which are incentive-based (that is, subject to meeting certain return criteria). These management fees are also payable on a regular basis (typically quarterly). The term of each CLO varies from deal to deal and may be subject to early redemption or extension; typically, however, a CLO will be wound down within eight to eleven years of being launched. The quantum of fees will decrease as the fund deleverages toward the end of its term.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The investment adviser of each of our separately managed accounts generally receives annual management fees typically based upon a percentage of each accounts net asset value or invested capital. The management fees we receive from each of our separately managed accounts are generally paid on a regular basis (typically quarterly) and if based on net asset value may proportionately increase or decrease based on the net asset value of the separately managed account. The management fees we are paid for managing a separately managed account will generally be subject to contractual rights the investor has to terminate our management of an account on generally as short as 30 days prior notice.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The investment adviser of each of our credit-focused registered and non-registered investment companies typically receives annual management fees based upon a percentage of each companys net asset value or total managed assets. The management fees we receive from the registered investment companies we manage are generally paid on a regular basis (typically quarterly) and proportionately increase or decrease based on the net asset value or gross assets of the investment company. The management fees we are paid

for managing the investment company will generally be subject to contractual rights the companys board of directors has to terminate our management of an account on as short as 30 days prior notice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The investment adviser of BXMT receives annual management fees based upon a percentage of BXMTs net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated core earnings (which is generally equal to its net income, calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), excluding certain non-cash and other items), subject to certain adjustments. The management fees we receive from managing BXMT are paid quarterly and increase or decrease based on, among other things, BXMTs net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated core earnings (subject to certain adjustments).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The investment adviser of BREIT receives a management fee based on a percentage of the REITs net asset value, payable monthly.

 For additional information regarding the management fee rates we receive, see Part II. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies  Revenue Recognition  Management and Advisory Fees, Net. 
 Incentive Fees 
 Incentive fees generally are performance based allocations of a funds net capital appreciation during a period, typically annually, subject to the achievement of minimum return levels, high water marks, and/or other hurdle provisions, in accordance with the respective terms set out in each funds governing agreements. Incentive fees are typically realized at the end of the measurement period. Once realized, such fees are typically not subject to clawback or reversal. The following describes the incentive fees earned generally by Blackstone. 

 | In our Hedge Fund Solutions segment, the investment adviser of our funds of hedge funds, certain hedge funds, separately managed accounts that invest in hedge funds and certain non-U.S. registered investment companies, is entitled to an incentive fee of 0% to 25%, as applicable, of the applicable investment vehicles net appreciation, subject to high water mark hurdle provisions and in some cases a preferred return. In addition, to the extent the mandate of our funds is to invest capital in third party managed hedge funds, as is the case with our funds of hedge funds, our funds will be required to pay incentive fees to such third party managers, which typically are borne by investors in such investment vehicles.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Performance Allocations 
 The general partner or an affiliate of each of our carry funds is entitled to a disproportionate allocation of the income otherwise allocable to the limited partners of such fund, commonly referred to as carried interest 
 
13 


  (Performance Allocations). Our ability to generate carried interest is an important element of our business and has historically accounted for a very significant portion of our income. 
 The carried interest is typically structured as a net profits interest in the applicable fund. In the case of our carry funds, carried interest is calculated on a realized gain basis, and each general partner (or affiliate) is generally entitled to a carried interest equal to 20% of the net realized income and gains (generally taking into account realized and unrealized or net unrealized losses) generated by such fund, except that the general partners (or affiliates) of certain of our credit-focused BREDS, BPP, Tactical Opportunities and secondary funds of funds, BTAS and BCEP, are generally entitled to a carried interest that ranges between 10% and 20%, depending on the specific fund (subject to variation across our business units and funds). Net realized income or loss is not netted between or among funds, and in some cases our carry funds provide for carried interest on current income distributions (subject to certain conditions). 
 For most carry funds, the carried interest is subject to an annual preferred limited partner return ranging from 5% to 8%, subject to a catch-up allocation to the general partner. Some of our carry funds (e.g., our Tactical Opportunities funds generally and certain BIS funds) do not provide for a preferred return, and generally the terms of our carry funds vary in certain respects across our business units and vintages. If, at the end of the life of a carry fund (or earlier with respect to certain of our real estate, real estate debt, core+ real estate, credit-focused and multi-asset class and/or opportunistic investment funds), as a result of diminished performance of later investments in a carry funds life, (a) the general partner receives in excess of the relevant carried interest percentage(s) applicable to the fund as applied to the funds cumulative net profits over the life of the fund, or (in certain cases) (b) the carry fund has not achieved investment returns that exceed the preferred return threshold (if applicable), then we will be obligated to repay an amount equal to the carried interest that was previously distributed to us that exceeds the amounts to which the relevant general partner was ultimately entitled on an after-tax basis. This is known as a clawback obligation and is an obligation of any person who received such carried interest, including us and other participants in our carried interest plans. 
 Although a portion of any distributions by us to our unitholders may include any carried interest received by us, we do not intend to seek fulfillment of any clawback obligation by seeking to have our unitholders return any portion of such distributions attributable to carried interest associated with any clawback obligation. To the extent we are required to fulfill a clawback obligation, however, our general partner may determine to decrease the amount of our distributions to common unitholders. The clawback obligation operates with respect to a given carry funds own net investment performance only and carried interest of other funds is not netted for determining this contingent obligation. Moreover, although a clawback obligation is several, the governing agreements of most of our funds provide that to the extent another recipient of carried interest (such as a current or former employee) does not fund his or her respective share of the clawback obligation then due, then we and our employees who participate in such carried interest plans may have to fund additional amounts (generally an additional 50% to 70% beyond our pro-rata share of such obligation) although we retain the right to pursue any remedies that we have under such governing agreements against those carried interest recipients who fail to fund their obligations. We have recorded a contingent repayment obligation equal to the amount that would be due on December 31, 2018, if the various carry funds were liquidated at their current carrying value. 
 For additional information concerning the clawback obligations we could face, see  Item 1A. Risk Factors   We may not have sufficient cash to pay back clawback obligations if and when they are triggered under the governing agreements with our investors. 
 Advisory and Transaction Fees 
 Some of our investment advisers or one of their affiliates, particularly real estate, private equity and credit-focused advisers, receive customary fees (for example, acquisition, origination and other transaction fees) upon consummation of their funds transactions, and may from time to time receive advisory, monitoring and other fees in connection with their activities. For most of the funds where we receive such fees, we are required to reduce the 
 
14 


  management fees charged to the funds limited partners by 50% to 100% of such limited partners share of such fees. 
 Capital Invested In and Alongside Our Investment Funds 
 To further align our interests with those of investors in our investment funds, we have invested the firms capital and that of our personnel in the investment funds we sponsor and manage. Minimum general partner capital commitments to our investment funds are determined separately with respect to our investment funds and, generally, are less than 5% of the limited partner commitments of any particular fund. See Part II. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information regarding our minimum general partner capital commitments to our funds. We determine whether to make general partner capital commitments to our funds in excess of the minimum required commitments based on, among other things, our anticipated liquidity, working capital and other capital needs. In many cases, we require our senior managing directors and other professionals to fund a portion of the general partner capital commitments to our funds. In other cases, we may from time to time offer to our senior managing directors and employees a part of the funded or unfunded general partner commitments to our investment funds. Our general partner capital commitments are funded with cash and not with carried interest or deferral of management fees. 
 Investors in many of our funds also receive the opportunity to make additional co-investments with the investment funds. Our personnel, as well as Blackstone itself, also have the opportunity to make co-investments, which we refer to as side-by-side investments, with many of our carry funds. Co-investments and side-by-side investments are investments in portfolio companies or other assets on the same terms and conditions as those acquired by the applicable fund. Co-investments refer to investments arranged by us that are made by our limited partner investors (and other investors in some instances) in a portfolio company or other assets alongside an investment fund. In certain cases, limited partner investors may pay additional management fees or carried interest in connection with such co-investments. Side-by-side investments are similar to co-investments but are made by directors, officers, senior managing directors, employees and certain affiliates of Blackstone. These investments are generally made pursuant to a binding election, subject to certain limitations, made once a year for the estimated activity during the ensuing 12 months under which those persons are permitted to make investments alongside a particular carry fund in all transactions of that fund for that year. Side-by-side investments are funded in cash and are not generally subject to management fees or carried interest. 
Competition 
 The asset management industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. We compete both globally and on a regional, industry and sector basis. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including investment performance, transaction execution skills, access to capital, access to and retention of qualified personnel, reputation, range of products and services, innovation and price. 
 We face competition both in the pursuit of outside investors for our investment funds and in acquiring investments in attractive portfolio companies and making other investments. Although many institutional and individual investors have increased the amount of capital they commit to alternative investment funds, such increases may create increased competition with respect to fees charged by our funds. Certain institutional investors are demonstrating a preference to in-source their own investment professionals and to make direct investments in alternative assets without the assistance of private equity advisers like us. We compete for investments with such institutional investors and such institutional investors could cease to be our clients. 
 Depending on the investment, we face competition primarily from sponsors managing other private equity funds, specialized investment funds, hedge funds and other pools of capital, other financial institutions and institutional investors (including sovereign wealth and pension funds), corporate buyers and other parties. Several of these competitors have significant amounts of capital and many of them have investment objectives similar to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Some of these competitors may also have a 
 
15 


  lower cost of capital and access to funding sources or other resources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to investment opportunities. In addition, some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments. Corporate buyers may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings with regard to an investment or be perceived by sellers as otherwise being more desirable bidders, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment. 
 In all of our businesses, competition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees. 
 For additional information concerning the competitive risks that we face, see  Item 1A. Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Business  The asset management business is intensely competitive. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 2,615 people, including our 147 senior managing directors. We strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, integrity and cooperation among our employees. 
Regulatory and Compliance Matters 
 Our businesses, as well as the financial services industry generally, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere. 
 All of the investment advisers of our investment funds operating in the U.S. are registered as investment advisers with the SEC (other investment advisers are registered in non-U.S. jurisdictions). Registered investment advisers are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Advisers Act. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation agreements, conflicts of interest, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure, advertising and custody requirements, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between an adviser and advisory clients, and general anti-fraud prohibitions. 
 Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P., a subsidiary of ours through which we conduct our capital markets business and certain of our fund marketing and distribution, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and is subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC, is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, and is registered as a broker-dealer in 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In addition, FINRA, a self-regulatory organization subject to oversight by the SEC, adopts and enforces rules governing the conduct, and examines the activities, of its member firms, including our broker-dealer entity. State securities regulators also have regulatory oversight authority over our broker-dealer entity. 
 Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including, among others, the implementation of a supervisory control system over the securities business, advertising and sales practices, conduct of and compensation in connection with public securities offerings, maintenance of adequate net capital, record keeping and the conduct and qualifications of employees. In particular, as a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA, Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P. is subject to the SECs uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. Rule 15c3-1 specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a significant part of a broker-dealers assets be kept in relatively liquid form. The SEC and various self-regulatory organizations impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, limit the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the capital structure of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SECs uniform net 
 
16 


  capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital. 
 In addition, certain of the closed ended and open ended mutual funds and investment management companies we manage, advise or sub-advise are registered under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act and the rules thereunder govern, among other things, the relationship between us and such investment vehicles and limit such investment vehicles ability to enter into certain transactions with us or our affiliates, including other funds managed, advised or sub-advised by us. 
 Pursuant to the U.K. Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, or FSMA, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations promulgated and administered by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The Blackstone Group International Partners LLP (BGIP) acts as a sub-advisor to its Blackstone U.S. affiliates in relation to the investment and re-investment of Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA)-based assets of Blackstone funds as well as arranging transactions to be entered into by or on behalf of Blackstone funds. BGIP also acts as a distributor of Blackstone funds in EMEA. BGIP has a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2007) (MiFID) cross-border passport to provide investment advisory services within the European Economic Area (EEA). BGIPs principal place of business is in London and it has Representative Offices in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), Milan and Paris. GSO Capital Partners International LLP (GSO U.K.) is also authorized and regulated by the FCA in the United Kingdom. As of November 1, 2018, GSO U.K. no longer carried out any business activities. GSO U.K. has a MiFID cross-border passport to provide investment advisory services and investment management within the EEA. GSO U.K.s principal place of business is in London. The FSMA and rules promulgated thereunder form the cornerstone of legislation which governs all aspects of our investment business in the United Kingdom, including sales, research and trading practices, provision of investment advice, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, regulatory capital, recordkeeping, approval standards for individuals, anti-money laundering, periodic reporting and settlement procedures. Blackstone Property Management Limited is authorized and regulated by the FCA in the United Kingdom as a property management and advisory company with the ability to administer contracts of insurance. 
 Blackstone / GSO Debt Funds Management Europe Limited (DFME) is authorized and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) as an Investment Firm under the European Communities (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2007. DFMEs principal activity is the provision of management and advisory services to certain CLO and sub-advisory services to certain affiliates. Blackstone / GSO Debt Funds Management Europe II Limited (DFME II) is authorized and regulated by the CBI as an Alternative Investment Fund Manager under the European Union (Alternative Investment Fund Managers Regulations) 2013 (AIFMRs). DFME II provides investment management functions including portfolio management, risk management, administration, marketing and related activities to its alternative investment funds in accordance with AIFMRs and the conditions imposed by the CBI as set out in the CBIs alternative investment fund rulebook. 
 Blackstone Europe Fund Management S.à r.l. (BEFM) is an approved Alternative Investment Fund Manager under the European Union Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (the AIFMD). BEFM may also provide discretionary portfolio management services and investment advice in accordance with article 5(4) of the Luxembourg Law of 12 July 2013 on alternative investment fund managers, as amended. BEFM provides investment management functions including portfolio management, risk management, administration, marketing and related activities to its alternative investment funds in accordance with AIFMD and the conditions imposed by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) in Luxembourg. BEFM has a branch entity established in Denmark. 
 Certain Blackstone operating entities are licensed and subject to regulation by financial regulatory authorities in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore: The Blackstone Group Japan K.K., a financial instruments firm, is registered with Kanto Local Finance Bureau (Kin-sho No. 1785) and regulated by the Japan Financial Services Agency; The Blackstone Group (HK) Limited is regulated by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission; The Blackstone Group (Australia) Pty Limited ACN 149 142 058 and Blackstone Real Estate Australia Pty Limited 
 
17 


  ACN 604 167 651 each holds an Australian financial services license authorizing it to provide financial services in Australia (AFSL 408376 and AFSL 485716, respectively) and is regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission; and Blackstone Singapore Pte. Ltd. is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (Company Registration Number: 201020503E). 
 Certain investment advisers are also registered with international regulators in connection with their management of products that are locally distributed and/or regulated. 
 The SEC and various self-regulatory organizations and state securities regulators have in recent years increased their regulatory activities, including regulation, examination and enforcement in respect of asset management firms. 
 As described above, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations of U.S. federal and state governments, non-U.S. governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to, among other things, marketing of investment products, disclosure and the privacy of client information, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or damage our reputation. Our businesses have operated for many years within a legal framework that requires us to monitor and comply with a broad range of legal and regulatory developments that affect our activities. However, additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by self-regulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, either in the United States or elsewhere, may directly affect our mode of operation and profitability. 
 Rigorous legal and compliance analysis of our businesses and investments is endemic to our culture and risk management. Our Chief Legal Officer and Global Head of Compliance, together with the Chief Compliance Officers of each of our businesses, supervise our compliance personnel, who are responsible for addressing all regulatory and compliance matters that affect our activities. We strive to maintain a culture of compliance through the use of policies and procedures including a code of ethics, electronic compliance systems, testing and monitoring, communication of compliance guidance and employee education and training. Our compliance policies and procedures address a variety of regulatory and compliance matters such as the handling of material non-public information, personal securities trading, marketing practices, gifts and entertainment, valuation of investments on a fund-specific basis, recordkeeping, potential conflicts of interest, the allocation of investment opportunities, collection of fees and expense allocation. 
 Our compliance group also monitors the information barriers that we maintain between Blackstones businesses. We believe that our various businesses access to the intellectual knowledge and contacts and relationships that reside throughout our firm benefits all of our businesses. To maximize that access without compromising compliance with our legal and contractual obligations, our compliance group oversees and monitors the communications between groups that are on the private side of our information barrier and groups that are on the public side, as well as between different public side groups. Our compliance group also monitors contractual obligations that may be impacted and potential conflicts that may arise in connection with these inter-group discussions. 
 In addition, disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting are documented, tested and assessed for design and operating effectiveness in accordance with the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Internal Audit, which reports directly to the audit committee of the board of directors of our general partner, operates with a global mandate and is responsible for the examination and evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the organizations governance and risk management processes and internal controls, as well as the quality of performance in carrying out assigned responsibilities to achieve the organizations stated goals and objectives. 
 Our enterprise risk management framework is designed to comprehensively identify, assess, mitigate and monitor our business, operational and other key enterprise risks at the corporate, business unit and fund level. Committees comprised of members of management and representatives of various business units and corporate 
 
18 


  functions consider and evaluate strategic, investment, reputational, financial, legal, compliance, human capital, operational, technology and other risks attendant to our business. Senior management reports regularly to the audit committee of the board of directors of our general partner on risk matters, including by providing periodic risk reports, an overview of managements views on key risks to the firm and detailed assessments of selected risks. 
 There are a number of pending or recently enacted legislative and regulatory initiatives in the United States and in Europe that could significantly affect our business. Please see  Item 1A. Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Business  Financial regulatory changes in the United States could adversely affect our business and  Item 1A. Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Business  Recent regulatory changes in jurisdictions outside the United States could adversely affect our business.
