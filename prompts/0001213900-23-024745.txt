ITEM 1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW



Rubicon currently consists of two subsidiaries, Rubicon Worldwide LLC, doing business as Rubicon Technology Worldwide LLC (“RTW”) and Rubicon Technology BP LLC (“BP”). In June 2021 the operations of Rubicon DTP LLC, doing business as Direct Dose Rx (“Direct Dose”) were discontinued.



RTW is an advanced materials provider specializing in monocrystalline sapphire for applications in optical and industrial systems. Sapphire is a desirable material for high-performance applications due to its hardness and strength, transparency in the visible and infrared spectrum, thermal conductivity, thermal shock resistance, abrasion resistance, high melting point and chemical inertness. As a result, it is ideally suited for extreme environments in a range of industries where material durability is just as important as optical clarity. We believe that we continue to have a reputation as one of the highest quality sapphire sources in the market. We provide optical and industrial sapphire products and materials in a variety of shapes and sizes. We manage our operations and ship from our owned facility located in Bensenville, Illinois.

Our sapphire business operates in a very competitive market. Our ability to expand our optical and industrial business and the acceptance of new product offerings are difficult to predict. Our total sales backlog was approximately $1,167,100 and $1,735,000 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 



In June 2021 the operations of Direct Dose Rx were discontinued. The costs associated with such closure were not material. Direct Dose Rx was a specialized pharmacy that provided prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs and vitamins to patients being discharged from skilled nursing facilities and hospitals, and directly to retail customers who want such medications delivered to their home. The delivered products were sorted by the dose, date, and time to be taken, and came in easy-to-use, perforated strip-packaging as opposed to separate pill bottles. Direct Dose Rx was licensed to operate in 11 states. The services offered by Direct Dose Rx benefited patients, skilled nursing facilities and hospitals by reducing the risk of hospital readmissions.



In August 2022, Janel Corporation (“Janel”) completed a tender offer to acquire 1,108,000 shares or 45% of our outstanding common stock at a price per share of $20.00. The tender offer was made pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2022, between the Company and Janel (the “Purchase Agreement”). The terms and conditions provided that, immediately after the consummation of the tender offer, the Company pay a cash distribution to all stockholders of $11.00 per share. This cash distribution was made in August 2022 and totaled approximately $27.1 million. As part of the transaction, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board of Directors”) approved Amendment No. 2 to the Rights Agreement dated as of December 18, 2017, between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, regarding the Company’s ability to utilize its U.S. net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards (the “Rights Agreement”). This amendment extended the final expiration date of the Rights Agreement to September 1, 2025. For more information regarding the Rights Agreement, see Note 8 – Stockholder Rights Agreement to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



We have significant NOL carryforwards. Under federal tax laws, we can carry forward and use our NOLs to reduce our future U.S. taxable income and tax liabilities until such NOL carryforwards expire in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “IRC”). Our NOL carryforwards provide a benefit to us, if fully utilized, of significant future tax savings. However, our ability to use these tax benefits in future years will depend upon the amount of our federal and state taxable income. If we do not have sufficient federal and state income in future years to use the benefits before they expire, we will permanently lose the benefit of the NOL carryforwards. Our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our NOL carryforwards is dependent upon our generation of future taxable profits and our ability to successfully identify and consummate suitable acquisitions or investment opportunities. As part of completing the Janel transaction, the Company took into consideration the impact it would have on the NOL carryforwards, and determined that the transaction would not result in any impairment. Rubicon is continuing to evaluate opportunities to utilize the NOL carryforwards.



Rubicon Technology, Inc. is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated on February 7, 2001. Our common stock was listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “RBCN” until it was delisted effective December 30, 2022 (see Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information). On January 3, 2023, our common stock began trading on the OTCQB Capital Market under the symbol “RBCN.”
Sapphire INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 



Sapphire is utilized in optical and industrial applications. It is used for windows and optics for aerospace, sensor, medical, semiconductor, instrumentation, electronics and laser applications due to its wide-band transmission, superior strength, chemical and scratch resistance and high strength-to-weight ratio. 
PRODUCTS 



 We provide optical and industrial sapphire products in various shapes and sizes. These optical sapphire products are qualified and used in equipment for a wide variety of end markets and high-performance applications, including defense and aerospace, specialty lighting, instrumentation, sensors and detectors, semiconductor process equipment, electronic substrates, medical and laser applications.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 



In 2022 and 2021, Rubicon did not incur any research and development (“R&D”) expenses and it currently does not have any plans for expenditures in 2023 related to R&D.
SALES AND MARKETING 



We market and sell through our direct sales force to customers. Our direct sales team includes experienced and technically sophisticated sales professionals and engineers who are knowledgeable in the development, manufacturing and use of sapphire windows and other optical materials.



A key component of our marketing strategy is developing and maintaining strong relationships with our customers. We achieve this by working closely with our customers to optimize our products for their production processes. We believe that maintaining close relationships with our customers’ senior management and providing technical support improves customer satisfaction.



CUSTOMERS 



Our principal customers have been defense subcontractors, industrial manufacturers, fabricators and resellers. A substantial portion of our sales have been to a small number of customers. In 2022, our top six customers (each 10% or greater of our revenues) accounted for, in the aggregate, approximately 72% of our revenue from our continuing operations and in 2021, the top three customers accounted for approximately 46% of our revenue from our continuing operations. A customer who had accounted for 22% of revenue from continuing operations in 2021 accounted for only 4% of revenue from continuing operations in 2022. Although we are attempting to diversify and expand our customer base, we expect our sales to continue to be concentrated among a small number of customers. We also expect that our significant customers may change from time to time due to various factors. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our sapphire revenues during 2022 or 2021 other than those referred to above.
COMPETITION 



The markets for high-quality sapphire products are very competitive and have been characterized by rapid technological change. The products we sell must meet certain demanding requirements to succeed in the marketplace. Although we are a well-established sapphire provider, we face significant competition from other established providers of similar products as well as from new and potential entrants into our markets.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 



From time to time, we use water, oils, slurries, acids, adhesives and other industrial chemicals. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of these materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These include statutory and regulatory provisions under which we are responsible for the management of hazardous materials we use and the disposition of hazardous wastes resulting from our manufacturing processes. Failure to comply with such provisions, whether intentional or inadvertent, could result in fines and other liabilities to the government or third parties, injunctions requiring us to suspend or curtail operations or other remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The cost of complying with environmental regulation is not material. 
EMPLOYEES 



As of December 31, 2022, we had 12 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relations to be good.
