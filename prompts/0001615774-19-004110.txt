Description of the Trust
 
Perth Mint Physical Gold ETF was formed pursuant to the Depository Trust Agreement on July 26, 2018. The Trust’s primary objective is to provide investors with an opportunity to invest in gold through its shares, and have the gold securely stored by Gold Corporation, who serves as the Custodial Sponsor and the Custodian. Another objective of the Trust is for the shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold less the expenses of the Trust’s operations. Each share represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest in the Trust’s net assets. The Trust’s assets consist principally of gold held by the Custodian for safekeeping on the Trust’s behalf. Physical Gold that the Trust holds includes London Bars and other gold products without numismatic value having a gold purity of at least 99.5% (including but not limited to coins, cast bars and minted bars).
 
The Sponsors of the Trust are Gold Corporation and Exchange Traded Concepts, LLC. Gold Corporation is a statutory body corporate established by the Gold Corporation Act and wholly-owned by the Government of Western Australia. Gold Corporation also serves as Custodian of the Trust’s gold bullion. Exchange Traded Concepts is an Oklahoma limited liability company.
 
The shares, known as Perth Mint Physical Gold ETF Shares, provide investors with the opportunity to access the gold market through a traditional brokerage account. Shares are issued by the Trust only in blocks of 50,000 shares called “Baskets” in exchange for gold from Authorized Participants, which is then allocated to the Trust and stored safely by the Custodian. The Trust may redeem Baskets in exchange for the amount of gold corresponding to the Basket’s redemption value. The Trust issues and redeems Baskets on an ongoing basis at Net Asset Value to Authorized Participants who have entered into a contract with the Administrative Sponsor and the Trustee.
 
Investors, at their option, may request to take delivery of Physical Gold in exchange for their shares by submitting their shares to Gold Corporation in exchange for Physical Gold. The Custodian’s obligations with respect to gold held on behalf of the Trust are subject to the Government Guarantee provided by the State of Western Australia pursuant to Section 22 of the Gold Corporation Act, which provides that the payment of the cash equivalent of gold due, payable and deliverable by the Custodian under the Gold Corporation Act is guaranteed by the Treasurer of Western Australia, in the name and on behalf of the Crown in right of the State of Western Australia.
 
The Trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. It does not have any officers, directors or employees and is administered by the Administrative Sponsor pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act, and is not required to register under such act. The Trust does not and will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act. The Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act and neither of the Sponsors nor the Trustee is subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor under the Commodity Exchange Act in connection with the shares.
 
The Trust
 
The Trust is governed by the Trust Agreement between the Sponsors and the Trustee, as amended from time to time. The Trust Agreement sets out the rights of investors and the rights and obligations of the Sponsors and the Trustee. The Trust has no fixed termination date.
 
The activities of the Trust are limited to: (1) issuing Baskets in exchange for the gold deposited by Authorized Participants with the Custodian for safekeeping; (2) delivering gold in exchange for Baskets surrendered by Authorized Participants for redemption; and (3) transferring gold to the Custodial Sponsor to pay the Custodial Sponsor Fee and reimburse the Custodial Sponsor for expenses that the Custodial Sponsor has paid on the Trust’s behalf, and (4) selling gold as needed to pay Trust expenses not assumed by the Custodial Sponsor.
 
The assets of the Trust consist primarily of gold held at the Custodian on behalf of the Trust. Gold will be sold: (i) to pay the expenses of the Trust not assumed by the Custodial Sponsor; and (ii) if the Trust terminates and liquidates its assets. Gold will be delivered or sold as otherwise required by law or regulation. The sale of gold by the Trust, including the sale of gold to generate cash to pay its fees and expenses—and although it is not entirely free from doubt, the transfer of gold to the Custodial Sponsor as remuneration for its services and/or reimbursement of the Trust’s expenses and/or liabilities—is a taxable event for investors.
 
The number of outstanding shares is expected to increase and decrease from time to time as a result of the creation and redemption of Baskets. The creation and redemption of Baskets requires the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of gold represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed. The total amount of gold required for the creation of Baskets will be based on the combined net assets represented by the number of Baskets being created or redeemed. The initial amount of gold required for deposit with the Trust to create shares was 500 Fine Ounces of gold per Basket. The number of fine ounces of gold required to create a Basket or to be delivered upon a redemption of a Basket will gradually decrease over time. This is because the shares comprising a Basket will represent a decreasing amount of gold due to the issuance of shares, or the delivery or sale of the Trust’s gold to pay the Custodial Sponsor Fee or the Trust’s expenses not assumed by the Custodial Sponsor.

The gold owned by the Trust consists of London Bars and other gold products without numismatic value having a gold purity of at least 99.5% (including but not limited to coins, cast bars and minted bars).
 
Trust Expenses
 
The Trust’s only ordinary recurring expense is the remuneration due to the Custodial Sponsor of 0.18% of the Net Asset Value of the Trust. In exchange for the Custodial Sponsor Fee, the Custodial Sponsor has agreed to assume and be responsible for the payment of the following expenses, up to the Fee Cap: the Administrative Sponsor’s fee; fees for the Trustee’s ordinary services and reimbursement of its ordinary out-of-pocket expenses; the Custodian’s fees and expenses specified in the Custody Agreement that are assumed by the Custodial Sponsor (if any); ordinary bar allocation fees that are charged to the Custodian in connection with the Custodian’s acquisition of sufficient Physical Gold for allocation to the Trust Allocated Metal Account in connection with a Purchase Order; ordinary or customary insurance costs and transportation fees; allocation costs associated with the allocation and de-allocation of gold to and from the Trust; the marketing expenses of the Trust; the listing fees of the Trust on the NYSE Arca; registration fees associated with the Trust charged by the SEC; printing and mailing costs; expenses for the maintenance of any website of the Trust; audit fees and expenses; and routine legal fees and expenses associated with the ordinary course of the Trust’s operations.
 
The Custodial Sponsor shall not be responsible for any other expenses, including litigation expenses associated with the Trust, taxes and other governmental charges, indemnification of the Trustee or the Administrative Sponsor pursuant to the Trust Agreement, any expenses that are in excess of the Fee Cap, extraordinary expenses incurred on behalf of the Trust, and otherwise as set forth in the Trust Agreement. An extraordinary expense is an expense arising or resulting from an underlying event or transaction that, in the determination of the Administrative Sponsor, is reasonably considered to be of a type that (i) possesses a high degree of abnormality (such as abnormally high (A) transportation fees, (B) bar allocation fees that may be incurred when acquiring sufficient Physical Gold for allocation to the Trust Allocated Metal Account in connection with a Purchase Order, or (C) Physical Gold allocation costs that may be incurred in relation to the allocation and de-allocation of Gold to and from the Trust) or is of a type that is reasonably considered to be unrelated to, or only incidentally related to, the ordinary and typical activities of the Trust and (ii) is of a type that would not reasonably be expected to recur in the foreseeable future. Extraordinary expenses shall include any fixing fees charged in connection with sales of gold required by applicable law or regulation or required upon termination of the Trust.
 
The Custodial Sponsor Fee accrues daily based on the prior Business Day’s Net Asset Value and is payable in gold. The fee is paid by delivering that amount of gold that equals the daily accrual of the Custodial Sponsor Fee for such prior month based on the Net Asset Value of the shares on the first business day of the following month. The Custodial Sponsor may earn a profit on its fees.
 
Separate from its role as Custodial Sponsor, Gold Corporation receives any premiums charged with respect to the delivery of gold to investors who have exchanged their shares for Physical Gold.
 
From time to time, the Custodial Sponsor may waive all or a portion of the Custodial Sponsor Fee at its discretion. The Custodial Sponsor is under no obligation to continue a waiver after the end of a stated period, and, if such waiver is not continued, the Custodial Sponsor Fee will thereafter be paid in full. Presently, the Custodial Sponsor does not intend to waive any of its fees. Furthermore, the Custodial Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, agree to rebate all or a portion of the Custodial Sponsor Fee attributable to shares held by certain institutional investors subject to minimum shareholding and lock up requirements as determined by the Custodial Sponsor to foster stability in the Trust’s asset levels. Any such rebate will be subject to negotiation and written agreement between the Custodial Sponsor and the investor on a case by case basis. The Custodial Sponsor is under no obligation to provide any rebates of the Custodial Sponsor Fee. Neither the Trust nor the Trustee will be a party to any Custodial Sponsor Fee rebate arrangements negotiated by the Custodial Sponsor.
 
Extraordinary expenses of the Trust that are not assumed by the Custodial Sponsor (as discussed above) may be paid by the Custodial Sponsor at its sole discretion and reimbursed by the Trust in gold. Otherwise, the Trustee will, when directed by the Custodial Sponsor, and, in the absence of such direction may, in its discretion, sell gold in such quantity and at such times as may be necessary to permit payment in cash of the Trust’s extraordinary expenses not assumed by a Sponsor. The Trustee is authorized to sell gold as directed by the Custodial Sponsor or otherwise at such times and in the smallest amounts required to permit such payments as they become due, it being the intention to avoid or minimize the Trust’s holdings of assets other than gold. Accordingly, the amount of gold to be sold will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trust’s expenses and the market price of gold. When selling gold, the Trustee shall place orders with the Custodian at the next available price used by the Trustee to determine the value of gold held by the Trust, or if the Custodian is unable or unwilling to execute such orders, with dealers through which the Trustee may reasonably expect to obtain a favorable price and good execution of the orders. Cash held by the Trustee pending payment of the Trust’s expenses will not bear any interest.
 
Valuation of Gold and Computation of Net Asset Value
 
On each business day that the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m. New York time, the Trustee values the gold held by the Trust and determines the Net Asset Value of the Trust, as described below.

2
-

 

The Net Asset Value of the Trust is the aggregate value of gold and other assets, if any, of the Trust (other than any amounts credited to the Trust’s reserve account, if any) and cash, if any, less liabilities of the Trust, which include estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities. The reserve account, if established, will be a separate non-interest bearing account with the Trustee or such other banking institution specified by the Administrative Sponsor, in consultation with the Custodial Sponsor, or if the Administrative Sponsor fails so to specify, as selected by the Trustee, in the name, and for the benefit, of the Trust, subject only to draft or order by the Trustee acting pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement. The Trustee will hold in such account all cash that it has credited to such account to reflect the reserves for taxes or other governmental charges and other contingent liabilities payable out of the Trust that the Trustee has determined from time to time to be required by GAAP. The Trustee also determines the Net Asset Value per share by dividing the Net Asset Value of the Trust by the number of the shares outstanding as of the close of trading on the NYSE Arca (which includes the net number of any shares deemed created or redeemed on such evaluation day).
 
All gold is valued based on its Fine Ounce content, calculated by multiplying the weight of gold by its purity; the same methodology is applied independent of the type of gold held by the Trust. The Trustee values the gold held by the Trust based on the afternoon LBMA Gold Price, or the morning LBMA Gold Price, if such day’s afternoon LBMA Gold Price is not available. If no LBMA Gold Price is available for the day, the Trustee values the Trust’s gold based on the most recently announced afternoon LBMA Gold Price or morning LBMA Gold Price. If the Custodial Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate to use, it must identify an alternate basis for evaluation to be employed by the Trustee. The Custodial Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to use a different publicly available price that the Custodial Sponsor determines to fairly represent the commercial value of the Trust’s gold.
 
The Trustee’s estimation of accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and liabilities is conclusive upon all persons interested in the Trust, and no revision or correction in any computation made under the Trust Agreement is required by reason of any difference in amounts estimated from those actually paid.
 
The Sponsors and the investors may rely on any evaluation or determination of any amount made by the Trustee, and, except for any determination by a Sponsor as to the price to be used to evaluate gold, a Sponsor has no responsibility for the evaluation’s accuracy. The determinations the Trustee makes are made in good faith upon the basis of, and the Trustee will not be liable for any errors contained in, information reasonably available to it. The Trustee is not liable to the Sponsors, Authorized Participants, investors or any other person for errors in judgment. However, the preceding liability exclusion will not protect the Trustee against any liability resulting from bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties.
 
Impact of Trust Expenses on the Trust’s Net Asset Value
 
The Net Asset Value of the Trust is used to compute the Custodial Sponsor Fee, and the Trustee subtracts from the Net Asset Value of the Trust the amount of accrued Custodial Sponsor Fee. The Trust withdraws gold from the Trust Allocated Metal Account for credit to the Trust Unallocated Metal Account and subsequently transfers such gold to an account maintained for the benefit of the Custodial Sponsor to pay the Custodial Sponsor Fee and reimburse the Custodial Sponsor for expenses that the Custodial Sponsor has paid on the Trust’s behalf. Should the need arise for the Trust to sell gold for expenses the Custodial Sponsor does not pay, the purchase price received as consideration for such sales will be the Trust’s sole source of funds to cover its liabilities. The Trust does not engage in any activity designed to derive a profit from changes in the price of gold. Gold not needed to redeem Baskets, to pay the Custodial Sponsor Fee or to cover the Trust’s expenses not assumed by the Custodial Sponsor is held in physical form by the Custodian. As a result of the payment of the Custodial Sponsor Fee in-kind and potential sales of gold to pay in cash the Trust expenses not assumed by the Custodial Sponsor, the Net Asset Value of the Trust and, correspondingly, the fractional amount of gold represented by each share, will decrease over the life of the Trust. New deposits of gold, received in exchange for additional new Baskets issued by the Trust, will not reverse this trend.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SHARES
 
The Trustee is authorized under the Trust Agreement to create and issue an unlimited number of shares. The Trustee will create shares in Baskets (a Basket equals a block of 50,000 shares) only upon the order of an Authorized Participant. The shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in the net assets of the Trust and have no par value.
Description of Limited Rights
 
The shares do not represent a traditional investment and should not be viewed as similar to “shares” of a corporation operating a business enterprise with management and a board of directors. Holders of the shares do not have the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation, including, for example, the right to bring “oppression” or “derivative” actions. All shares are of the same class with equal rights and privileges. Each share is transferable, is fully paid and non-assessable and entitles the holder to vote on the limited matters upon which investors may vote under the Trust Agreement. The shares are entitled to be redeemed or exchanged for gold. The shares do not entitle their holders to any conversion or pre-emptive rights or redemption rights for single shares.
Redemption of Shares
 
The shares may be redeemed by or through an Authorized Participant in Baskets. See “Creation and Redemption of Shares by Authorized Participants” for details.
 
Distributions
 
If the Trust is terminated and liquidated, the Trustee will distribute to the investors any amounts remaining after the satisfaction of all outstanding liabilities of the Trust and the establishment of such reserves for applicable taxes, other governmental charges and contingent or future liabilities as the Trustee shall determine. Investors of record on the record date fixed by the Trustee in consultation with the Administrative Sponsor for a distribution will be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of any distribution.
Voting Rights
 
Under the Trust Agreement, investors have no voting rights, except in the following limited circumstances: (i) registered holders of at least 25% of the shares have the right to require the Trustee to cure any material breach by it of the Trust Agreement, and (ii) registered holders of at least 75% of the shares have the right to require the Trustee to terminate the Trust Agreement. Otherwise, no investor shall have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise to control the operation or management of the Trust. In addition, certain amendments to the Trust Agreement require advance notice to the investors before the effectiveness of such amendments, but no investor vote or approval is required for any amendment to the Trust Agreement.
 
Book-Entry Form
 
Individual certificates are not issued for the shares. Instead, one or more global certificates are deposited by the Trustee with DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates evidence all of the shares outstanding at any time. Under the Trust Agreement, investors may only hold shares through (i) DTC Participants, (ii) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant (“Indirect Participants”), or (iii) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants. The shares are only transferable through the book-entry system of DTC. Investors who are not DTC Participants may transfer their shares through DTC by instructing the DTC Participant holding their shares (or by instructing the Indirect Participant or other entity through which their shares are held) to transfer the shares. Transfers will be made in accordance with standard securities industry practice.
 
DTC may decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to Baskets and/or the shares by giving notice to the Trustee and the Administrative Sponsor. Under such circumstances, the Administrative Sponsor, in consultation with the Custodial Sponsor, will find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost or, if a replacement is unavailable, the Trustee will terminate the Trust.
 
The rights of the investors generally must be exercised by DTC Participants acting on their behalf in accordance with the rules and procedures of DTC. Because the shares can only be held in book-entry form through DTC and DTC Participants, investors must rely on DTC, DTC Participants and any other financial intermediary through which they hold the shares to receive the benefits and exercise the rights described in this section. Investors should consult with their broker or financial institution to find out about procedures and requirements for securities held in book-entry form through DTC.
 
Delivery of Gold to and from the Trust
 
Pursuant to agreements between Gold Corporation, in its individual capacity, and the Authorized Participants, the Basket Gold Amount to be deposited by an Authorized Participant into the Trust Unallocated Metal Account in connection with a Purchase Order and the amount of gold to be withdrawn from the Trust Unallocated Metal Account and delivered to an Authorized Participant in connection with a Redemption Order shall be deposited into or withdrawn from the Trust Unallocated Metal Account either by way of transfer from or to the GC Metal Account or by way of transfer from or to a Gold account of an Authorized Participant maintained on an Unallocated Basis by Gold Corporation.
 

4
-

 

None of the Trustee, the Sponsors (in the case of the Custodial Sponsor, in its capacity as Custodial Sponsor) or the Trust shall have any liability for any loss resulting from the use of the GC Metal Account or for any act or inaction of Gold Corporation related to the GC Metal Account.

The Sponsors
 
Gold Corporation and ETC are the sponsors of the Trust. The Administrative Sponsor, ETC, is an Oklahoma limited liability company majority owned by Cottonwood ETF Holdings LLC. ETC’s mailing address is 10900 Hefner Pointe Drive, Suite 207, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73120. ETC is a registered investment adviser and provides investment advisory services to domestic and international equity and fixed income ETFs. As of December 31, 2018, ETC had approximately $4 billion of assets under management. The Custodial Sponsor, Gold Corporation, is a statutory corporation established by the Gold Corporation Act and wholly-owned by the Government of Western Australia. Its mailing address is GPO Box M924, Perth, WA 6843, Australia. Gold Corporation and its subsidiaries, trading as The Perth Mint, supply precious metal-related products and services.
The Custodial Sponsor’s Role
 
In exchange for the Custodial Sponsor Fee, the Custodial Sponsor has agreed to assume the payment of expenses incurred by the Trust, including but not limited to: organizational expenses; the Trustee’s monthly fee for its ordinary services and reimbursement of its ordinary out-of-pocket expenses; the Administrative Sponsor’s fee payable pursuant to the Trust Agreement; the Custodian’s fees and expenses reimbursable to it pursuant to the Custody Agreement (if any); marketing expenses; exchange listing fees; SEC registration fees; printing and mailing costs; maintenance expenses for the Trust’s website; audit fees and expenses; and routine legal fees and expenses (for instance, the Administrative Sponsor, with the prior approval of the Custodial Sponsor, may from time to time employ counsel to act on behalf of the Trust and perform any legal services in connection with the Trust, including any legal matters relating to the possible disposition or acquisition of any gold. Such fees and expenses shall be paid by the Custodial Sponsor). However, the Custodial Sponsor will not be responsible for litigation expenses, taxes and other governmental charges, indemnification of the Trustee or the Administrative Sponsor pursuant to the Trust Agreement, extraordinary expenses, and otherwise as set forth in the Trust Agreement.
 
In addition, the Custodial Sponsor may perform assaying of Physical Gold, and other services relating to the safe custody of gold, as necessary.
 
The Administrative Sponsor’s Role
 
The Administrative Sponsor generally oversees the performance of the Trustee and the Trust’s principal service providers, but does not exercise day-to-day oversight of the Trustee or such service providers. The Administrative Sponsor, with the prior written approval of the Custodial Sponsor, may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee (1) if the Trustee ceases to meet certain objective requirements (including the requirement that it have capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least $150 million), (2) if, having received written notice from the Administrative Sponsor, in consultation with the Custodial Sponsor, or registered owners acting on behalf of at least 25% of the outstanding shares, of a material breach of the Trustee’s obligations under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee has not cured the breach within 30 days, or (3) if the Trustee fails to consent to the implementation of an amendment to the Trust’s initial Internal Control Over Financial Reporting reasonably deemed necessary by the Administrative Sponsor and, after consultations with the Administrative Sponsor, the Administrative Sponsor and the Trustee fail to resolve their differences regarding the proposed amendment. The Administrative Sponsor, in consultation with the Custodial Sponsor, also has the right to replace the Trustee during the 90 days following any merger, consolidation or conversion in which the Trustee is not the surviving entity or, in its discretion, on the fifth anniversary of the creation of the Trust or on any subsequent third anniversary thereafter.
 
In addition, the Administrative Sponsor: (1) will develop a marketing plan for the Trust on an ongoing basis; (2) will prepare marketing materials regarding the shares; (3) maintains the Trust’s web site; and (4) may request the Trustee to order Custodian audits (to the extent permitted under the Custody Agreement).

The Trustee
 
BNYM, a banking corporation organized under New York State law with trust powers, serves as the Trustee. The Trustee has a trust office at 2 Hanson Place, Brooklyn, New York 11217. The Trustee is subject to supervision by the New York State Financial Services Department and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Information regarding creation and redemption Basket composition, Net Asset Value of the Trust, transaction fees for the creation and redemption of Baskets and the names of the parties that have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement may be obtained from the Trustee. A copy of the Trust Agreement is available for inspection at the Trustee’s trust office identified above. Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee is required to maintain capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least $150 million.
The Trustee’s Role
 
The Trustee is generally responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust, including keeping the Trust’s operational records. The Trustee’s principal responsibilities include: (1) valuing the Trust’s gold and calculating the Net Asset Value per share of the Trust; (2) supplying inventory information received from the Custodian to the Administrative Sponsor for the Trust’s website; (3) receiving and processing orders from Authorized Participants for the creation and redemption of Baskets; (4) coordinating the processing of orders from Authorized Participants with the Custodian and DTC, including coordinating with the Custodian the receipt of gold transferred to the Trust in connection with each issuance of Baskets; (5) transferring gold to the Custodial Sponsor in lieu of paying the Custodial Sponsor Fee in cash; (6) transferring gold to the Custodial Sponsor in lieu of reimbursing the Custodial Sponsor for cash payments owed by the Trust, but undertaken by the Custodial Sponsor; (7) selling the Trust’s gold pursuant to a Sponsor’s direction or otherwise as needed to pay any extraordinary Trust expenses that are not assumed by a Sponsor; (8) holding the Trust’s cash and other financial assets, if any; (9) when appropriate, making distributions of cash or other property (other than gold) to investors; and (10) receiving and reviewing reports on the custody of and transactions in the Trust’s gold from the Custodian and taking such other actions in connection with the custody of gold as a Sponsor instructs. The Trustee shall, with respect to directing the Custodian, act in accordance with the instructions of the Custodial Sponsor or the Administrative Sponsor in accordance with the Trust Agreement. Under the agreement with the Custodian, the Trustee, the Administrative Sponsor and their Physical Gold auditors may visit the premises of the Custodian for the purpose of examining the Trust’s gold and certain related records maintained by the Custodian.
 
The Trustee does not monitor the performance of the Custodian other than to review the reports provided by the Custodian pursuant to the Custody Agreement. The Trustee, along with the Sponsors, will liaise with the Trust’s legal, accounting and other professional service providers as needed. The Trustee will assist and support the Administrative Sponsor with the preparation of all periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC on behalf of the Trust. The Trustee’s monthly fees and out-of-pocket expenses will be paid by the Custodial Sponsor. Affiliates of the Trustee may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell gold or shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.
 
The Trustee will keep proper books of registration and transfer of shares at its office located in New York or such office as it may subsequently designate. These books and records are open to inspection by any person who establishes to the Trustee’s satisfaction that such person is an investor at all reasonable times during the usual business hours of the Trustee. The Trustee will keep a copy of the Trust Agreement on file in its office which will be available for inspection on reasonable advance notice at all reasonable times during its usual business hours by any investor.

The Custodian
 
Gold Corporation serves also as the Custodian for the Trust’s gold bullion. The Custodian’s office is located at 310 Hay Street, East Perth, WA 6004, Australia.
 
The Custodian’s Role
 
The Custodian is responsible for holding the Trust’s gold, as well as receiving and converting allocated and unallocated gold on behalf of the Trust. The Custodian shall store Physical Gold in its own vaulting facilities, generally in Perth, Australia, or such other locations where the Custodian may maintain vaulting facilities from time to time, and utilize the services of its appointed secure transportation provider(s) at the risk of the Custodian. The Custodian may appoint sub-custodians from time to time for the custody and safekeeping of Physical Gold, but the Custodian remains liable for the custody and safe-keeping of that Physical Gold.
 
In an effort to ensure that gold held by the Custodian is safe, the Custodian employs a team of specialist security officers to monitor for external and internal threats and who work closely with specialist gold detectives from the West Australian Police Force. The Custodian’s vaults are Category 11 vaults, meet AUS/NZ Standards 3809, and have each been vetted by the Custodian’s underwriters. The Custodian’s sites are monitored 24 hours per day with video recordings and access to and within its facilities are controlled electronically from a Class 1 Security Control Room. The Custodian’s risk management team ensures compliance with an extensive level of procedural security for receiving, releasing and accounting for precious metal (including a Metals Accountant whose sole focus is ongoing reconciliation of the Custodian’s ounce assets and liabilities). Additionally, the Custodian’s specialist security officers, risk team and insurers will vet and approve the use of any Sub-Custodians to ensure the gold they hold for and on behalf of the Custodian is as safely and securely held by them to the same high standards as those of the Custodian.
 
The Custodian must allocate, or cause to be allocated, ownership of gold to the Trust Allocated Metal Account such that no amount of gold remains standing to the credit of the Trust Unallocated Metal Account at the Custodian’s close of business on each Business Day. In the event that the Custodian is unable to fully effect such allocation by such time due to reasons outside of its or its Sub-Custodian’s control, the Custodian will use reasonable efforts to cause such allocation as soon as possible.
 
The Custodian converts the Trust’s gold between allocated and unallocated gold when: (1) Authorized Participants engage in creation and redemption transactions with the Trust; (2) gold is transferred to the Custodial Sponsor’s account to pay the Custodial Sponsor Fee or reimburse costs, expenses and other amounts to which the Custodial Sponsor is entitled to be reimbursed in accordance with the Trust Agreement; or (3) gold is sold to pay Trust expenses. The Custodian will facilitate the transfer of gold in and out of the Trust through the GC Metal Account as applicable. The Custodian is responsible for allocating gold to the Trust Allocated Metal Account. The Custodian’s obligations in relation to gold owned by the Trust and held in safekeeping by the Custodian (whether in the Trust Unallocated Metal Account, Trust Allocated Metal Account or the GC Metal Account) are held subject to the Government Guarantee.
 
If for any reason Physical Gold credited to the Trust Allocated Metal Account (i) does not meet the requirements for Physical Gold or (ii) does not contain the number of Fine Ounces that has been reported to the Trustee, the Custodian shall as soon as practical replace such Physical Gold with Physical Gold that meets the requirements for Physical Gold or contains the number of Fine Ounces reported to the Trustee by (i) debiting the Trust Allocated Metal Account and crediting the Trust Unallocated Metal Account with the requisite amount of Physical Gold to be replaced, (ii) providing replacement Physical Gold that is of an amount that approximates the amount of Physical Gold to be replaced as closely as practical, and (iii) debiting the Trust Unallocated Metal Account and crediting the Trust Allocated Metal Account with the requisite amount of replacement Physical Gold. The Custodian shall not start the foregoing replacement process on a particular Business Day unless it is reasonably sure that such replacement process can be started and completed in the same Business Day. The Custodian shall notify the Trustee as soon as practicable on the Business Day (but no later than the end of business on such Business Day) when (i) the Custodian has determined that Physical Gold credited to the Trust Allocated Metal Account is to be replaced and (ii) when replacement Physical Gold has been credited to the Trust Allocated Metal Account in accordance with the above instructions. The cost of any such replacement shall be borne by the Custodian.
 
The Custodian may from time to time employ Sub-Custodians solely for the custody and safekeeping of Physical Gold, including in locations where the Custodian does not maintain its own vaulting or other secure storage facilities or when the Custodian’s vaulting facilities are insufficient to hold the Physical Gold of the Trust. The Custodian will use reasonable care in selecting any Sub-Custodian. In selecting any Sub-Custodian with reasonable care, the Custodian is to determine if such Sub-Custodian can reasonably be expected to operate in a reasonable and prudent manner and in compliance with all relevant laws, rules and regulations applicable to its services as a sub-custodian of Gold. Any Physical Gold held by a Sub-Custodian shall be recorded by the Custodian as being held in the Trust Allocated Metal Account at all times. The Custodian shall be liable in contract, tort or otherwise for any loss, damage or expense arising directly or indirectly from any act or omission, or insolvency, of any Sub-Custodian. The Custodian will provide the Trustee and the Administrative Sponsor with the name and address of any Sub-Custodian the Custodian selects, along with any other information which the Trustee or the Administrative Sponsor may reasonably request concerning the appointment of such Sub-Custodian.
 
The Custodian will provide the Trustee with regular reports detailing the gold transfers in and out of the Trust Unallocated Metal Account and identifying the gold bars held in the Trust Allocated Metal Account.

The Custodian receives the Custodial Sponsor Fee under the terms of the Trust Agreement and shall receive no additional compensation for its services to the Trust under the Custody Agreement. The Custodian and its affiliates may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell gold or shares for their own account, as an agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. The Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, has entered into agreements with the Custodian, under which the Custodian maintains the Trust Allocated Metal Account and the Trust Unallocated Metal Account.
 
Under the Trust Agreement, the Administrative Sponsor, in consultation with the Custodial Sponsor, is responsible for appointing accountants or other inspectors to monitor the accounts and operations of the Custodian and for enforcing the obligations of the Custodian as is necessary to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of the investors. Under the Custody Agreement, the Custodian has agreed, and will procure that any Sub-Custodian will agree, to permit Physical Gold auditors access to their respective premises during normal business hours to examine the gold held for the Trust and such records as they reasonably require. The Trustee has no obligation to monitor the activities of the Custodian or any Sub-Custodian other than to receive and review such reports of the gold held for the Trust by the Custodian and of transactions in gold held for the account of the Trust made by the Custodian pursuant to the Custody Agreement.
 
Inspection of Gold

The Gold Industry
 
Gold Supply and Demand
 
Two unique qualities of gold set it apart from other commodities: (i) gold (whether coin, jewelry or bullion) can be stored in a vault at low cost and not deteriorate; and (ii) gold can be used as a store of value. From its original use in jewelry and decorative arts to its later role as a standard trading medium and storage of value, gold has been instrumental in the historical development of the world’s economies and exchange systems. Today, gold remains a key component of many countries’ official reserves and has retained its importance within jewelry making. Along with its aesthetic attributes and scarcity, gold exhibits desirable physical characteristics as a trading medium: great malleability and durability. Gold is an easy metal to work with—it is often discovered in a virtually pure and workable state, making it easy to be melted, processed, and formed into standardized shapes. As a unit of value, gold therefore displays high levels of portability and measurability. Moreover, as compared to other perishable commodities that have historically been used as mediums of exchange (i.e., cattle, furs and tobacco), gold is much more durable; in addition to its malleability, gold is resistant to corrosion and tarnish, allowing gold to retain an intrinsically stable value. The table below summarizes the world gold supply and demand from 2010-2016 and is based on information reported in Gold Focus 2018.

Totals may not add due to independent rounding. Net producer hedging is the change in the physical market impact of mining companies’ gold loans, forwards and options positions.
 
According to the data above, gold supply averaged 4,439 tonnes (t) per year between 2013 and 2017. The largest portion of gold supplied to the market is from mine production, which averaged approximately 3,202t per year from 2013 through 2017. The second largest source of annual gold supply is recycling gold, which is gold that has been recovered from jewelry and other fabricated products and converted back into marketable gold. Recycled gold averaged approximately 1,207t annually between 2013 through 2017.
 
According to the data above, gold demand averaged 4,426t per year between 2013 and 2017. Gold demand generally comes from four sources: jewelry, industry (including medical applications), investment and the official sector (including central banks and supranational organizations). The largest source of demand comes from jewelry fabrication, which accounted for approximately 54% of the identifiable demand from 2013 through 2017 followed by net physical investment, which represents identifiable investment demand, which accounted for approximately 27%.
 
Central bank purchases averaged 514t during the same period. The prominence given by market commentators to this activity coupled with the total amount of gold held by the official sector has resulted in this area being one of the more visible shifts in the gold market.
 
Historical Price of Gold
 
The price of gold is volatile and its fluctuations are expected to have a direct impact on the value of the Trust’s price per share. However, movements in the price of gold in the past, and any past or present trends, are not a reliable indicator of future movements.
 
Movements in the price of gold may be influenced by various factors, including economic concerns, announcements from central banks regarding a country’s reserve gold holdings, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and global political uncertainty.
 
The following chart illustrates the changes in the price of gold in U.S. dollars per ounce over the period from June 1992 through December 2018. The price of gold in the chart is based on the London AM Gold Fix and the LBMA Gold Price AM. The LBMA Gold Price replaced the previously established London Gold Fix on March 20, 2015.

Operation of the Gold Bullion Market
 
The global trade in gold consists of over-the-counter, or OTC, transactions in spot, forwards, and options and other derivatives, together with exchange-traded futures and options.
 
Global Over-the-Counter Market for Gold
 
The OTC market trades on a continuous basis and accounts for most global gold trading. Market makers and participants in the OTC market trade with each other and their clients on a principal-to-principal basis. All risks and issues of credit are between the parties directly involved in a specific transaction. The three products relevant to the LBMA are spot (S) contracts, forward (F) contracts and options (O) contracts. A “spot contract” is a contract to buy or sell gold typically on or before two Business Days following the date of the execution of the contract. A “forward contract” is an agreement to buy or sell gold at a future date beyond the spot date at a price set at the time of the contract. An “option contract” is an agreement that conveys to the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of gold at a predetermined rate during a period or at a time in the future. There are thirteen LBMA Market Makers who provide the service in one, two or all three products. Of the thirteen LBMA Market Makers, there are five Full Market Makers and eight Market Makers. The five Full Market Makers quoting prices in all three products are: Citibank N A, Goldman Sachs, HSBC Bank, JP Morgan Chase Bank and UBS. The eight LBMA Market Makers who provide two-way pricing in either one or two products are: ICBC Standard Bank (S), Merrill Lynch International (S, O), Morgan Stanley & Co International (S, O), Societe Generale (S), Standard Chartered Bank (S, O), Bank of Nova Scotia -ScotiaMocatta (S, F), Toronto-Dominion Bank (F) and BNP Paribas SA (F).
 
The OTC market provides a relatively flexible market in terms of quotes, price, size, destinations for delivery and other factors. Bullion dealers customize transactions to meet their clients’ requirements. The OTC market has no formal structure and no open-outcry meeting place.
 
The main centers of the OTC market are London, New York and Zurich. Mining companies, central banks, manufacturers of jewelry and industrial products, together with investors and speculators, tend to transact their business through one of these centers. Centers such as Dubai and several cities in the Far East also transact substantial OTC market business. Bullion dealers have offices around the world and most of the world’s major bullion dealers are either members or associate members of the LBMA.

In the OTC market, the standard size of gold trades ranges between 5,000 and 10,000 ounces. Bid-offer spreads are typically $0.50 per ounce. Transaction costs in the OTC market are negotiable between the parties and therefore vary widely, with some dealers willing to offer clients competitive prices for larger volumes, although this will vary according to the dealer, the client and market conditions. Cost indicators can be obtained from various information service providers, as well as dealers.
 
Liquidity in the OTC market can vary from time to time during the course of the 24-hour trading day. Fluctuations in liquidity are reflected in adjustments to dealing spreads—the difference between a dealer’s “buy” and “sell” prices. The period of greatest liquidity in the gold market generally occurs at the time of day when trading in the European time zones overlaps with trading in the United States, which is when OTC market trading in London, New York and other centers coincides with futures and options trading on the New York Commodities Exchange (an affiliate of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc.).
 
The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)
 
The LBMA is a trade association that, among other duties, maintains and publishes “Good Delivery” lists that establish a set of criteria that a refiner and its gold must satisfy before being accepted for trading. Although the market for Physical Gold is distributed globally, most over-the-counter market trades are cleared through London. The LBMA coordinates the market for gold and acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators.
 
A primary function of the LBMA is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the “London Good Delivery Lists,” which are the lists of LBMA accredited melters and assayers of gold as well as the specifications to which a bar/ingot must adhere. The LBMA also coordinates market clearing and vaulting, and promotes good trading practices.
 
“Good Delivery” is a list of specifications a bar or ingot must meet to trade on the London gold markets. The standards for gold bars meeting the “London Good Delivery Lists” are published in LBMA’s “The Good Delivery Rules for Gold and Silver Bars.”
 
Gold is usually traded on the London market on a loco London basis. This means the gold is physically held in vaults in London or is transferred into accounts established in London. Payment upon settlement and delivery of a loco London spot trade is usually in US dollars, two business days after the trade date. Delivery of the gold is either by physical delivery or through the LBMA clearing system to an unallocated account.
 
Futures Exchanges
 
Although the Trust will not invest in gold futures, information about the gold futures market is relevant as such markets are a source of liquidity for the overall market for gold and impact the price of gold.
 
The major futures and options exchanges include the New York Commodities Exchange, the Multi Commodity Exchange of India, the Tokyo Commodities Exchange, and the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Other leading exchanges for gold derivatives trading include NYSE Liffe and Dubai Gold & Commodities Exchange. Gold futures and options are traded on these exchanges in standardized transaction sizes and delivery dates. Only a small portion of the gold futures market turnover is typically physically delivered.
 
Over recent years China has become an important source of gold demand and its futures markets have grown. Gold futures contracts are traded on the Shanghai Futures Exchange and the Shanghai Gold Exchange.

Creation and Redemption of Shares by Authorized PArticipants
 
The Trust issues and redeems Baskets only to Authorized Participants. The creation and redemption of Baskets will only be made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of gold represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be based on the combined Fine Ounces represented by the number of shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received.
 
Orders to create and redeem Baskets may be placed only by Authorized Participants. The Authorized Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of the gold required for such creations and redemptions. The Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by the Trustee and the Administrative Sponsor, without the consent of any investor or Authorized Participant. A transaction fee of $500 will be assessed on all creation and redemption transactions and paid to the Trustee. Multiple Baskets may be created on the same day, provided each Basket meets the requirements described below.
 
Authorized Participants who make deposits with the Trust in exchange for Baskets will receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either a Sponsor or the Trust, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to a Sponsor or the Trust to effect any sale or resale of shares.
 
Creation Procedures - Authorized Participants
 
On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to create one or more Baskets. Purchase orders must be placed prior to the Order Cutoff Time on any business day. The day on which the Trustee receives a valid purchase order is the purchase order date.
 
By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit gold with the Trust, as described below. Prior to the delivery of Baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant also must have wired to the Trustee the amount of the applicable transaction fees and expenses due for the purchase order, including the Trustee’s fee and all taxes, governmental charges and fees payable in connection with such deposit, the transfer of gold and the issuance and delivery of shares.
 
Determination of Required Deposits
 
The Trustee shall determine the Basket Gold Amount for each Business Day, and each such determination thereof and the Trustee’s resolution of questions concerning the composition of the Basket Gold Amount shall be final and binding on all persons interested in the Trust.
 
Fractions of a Fine Ounce of gold included in the Basket Gold Amount smaller than 0.001 Fine Ounces shall be disregarded. The Custodial Sponsor shall publish, or shall designate the Administrative Sponsor or other persons to publish, for each Business Day, the Basket Gold Amount.
 
Delivery of Required Deposits
 
An Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for crediting its account, if held at the Custodian, with the required gold deposit amount and, if the Authorized Participant does not maintain its account with the Custodian, causing the required gold deposit to be transferred to the Custodian, by 8:00 a.m. (London time) on the second business day following the purchase order date. No shares are issued unless and until the Custodian has informed the Trustee that it has credited to the Trust the corresponding amount of gold. Upon transfer of the gold deposit amount to the Trust, the Trustee will direct DTC to credit the number of Baskets ordered to the Authorized Participant’s DTC account. The expense and risk of delivery, ownership and safekeeping of gold, until such gold has been received by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust, shall be borne solely by the Authorized Participant.
Rejection of Purchase Orders
 
The Trustee may, and upon direction of a Sponsor shall, reject a gold deposit at any time (i) when the Trustee’s transfer books are closed, (ii) if the Custodian has informed the Trustee and the Administrative Sponsor that it is unable to allocate gold to the Trust Allocated Metal Account, or (iii) if any such action is deemed necessary or advisable by the Custodial Sponsor, for any reason in its sole discretion at any time or from time to time, but only after consulting with the Administrative Sponsor. Neither the Trustee nor a Sponsor will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or gold deposit.
Redemption Procedures - Authorized Participants
 
The procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more Baskets will mirror the procedures for the creation of Baskets. On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to redeem one or more Baskets. Redemption orders must be placed prior to the Order Cutoff Time on each business day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. A redemption order so received is effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Trustee. The redemption procedures allow only Authorized Participants to redeem Baskets. An investor may not redeem Baskets other than through an Authorized Participant.
 
By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Baskets to be redeemed through DTC’s book-entry system to the Trust no later than the second business day following the effective date of the redemption order. Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Trustee the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order.
 

13
--

 

The redemption distribution from the Trust will consist of a credit to the redeeming Authorized Participant’s account representing the amount of the gold held by the Trust evidenced by the shares being redeemed as of the date of the redemption order. Fractions of a Fine Ounce included in the redemption distribution smaller than 0.001 of a Fine Ounce are disregarded. A redeeming Authorized Participant is responsible for any applicable tax, fees or other governmental charge that may be due, as well as any charges or fees in connection with the transfer of gold and the issuance and delivery of shares, and any expense associated with the delivery of gold other than by credit to an Authorized Participant’s unallocated account with the Custodian or another LBMA-member clearing bank.
 
Delivery of Redemption Distribution
 
The redemption distribution due from the Trust is delivered to the Authorized Participant on the third business day following the redemption order date if, by 9:00 a.m. New York time on the second business day following the redemption order date, the Trustee’s DTC account has been credited with the Baskets to be redeemed.
 
The Custodian will arrange for the redemption amount in gold to be transferred from the Trust Allocated Metal Account to the Trust Unallocated Metal Account, and, ultimately, to the redeeming Authorized Participant’s account. With respect to a redemption order provided in the ordinary course, the Custodian shall deliver unallocated gold to the account indicated by the redeeming Authorized Participant in its redemption order on the third business day following the order date, unless a different business day is expressly agreed to by the parties at the time of the transaction.
 
Suspension or Rejection of Redemption Orders
 
The Trustee may, in its discretion, and will when directed by the Custodial Sponsor, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date or reject a particular redemption order (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on the NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of gold is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as the Sponsors determine to be necessary for protection of registered owners of shares. Neither a Sponsor nor the Trustee will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension, postponement or rejection.
 
The Trustee will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Authorized Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful.
 
Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee
 
To compensate the Trustee for services in processing the creation and redemption of Baskets, an Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee to the Trustee of $500 per order to create or redeem Baskets. An order may include multiple Baskets. The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by the Trustee with the consent of the Sponsors.
Tax Responsibility
 
Authorized Participants are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or other governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of Baskets - and delivery and receipt of gold pursuant thereto regardless of whether such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Participant. By placing a purchase order or redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to indemnify the Sponsors, the Trustee and the Trust if any of them is required by law to pay any such tax or charge, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.

TAKING DELIVERY OF PHYSICAL GOLD
 
In exchange for its shares, an investor is entitled to receive from Gold Corporation an amount of Physical Gold in return for such shares on the day on which the investor’s broker-dealer submits his or her shares to Gold Corporation in exchange for Physical Gold. The number of shares to be delivered by an investor and the corresponding amount of Physical Gold received for such shares shall be specified by Gold Corporation from time to time and notified by Gold Corporation to the investor in an Application. None of the Trustee, the Administrative Sponsor or the Trust are involved in the exchange of an investor’s shares for Physical Gold.
Application
 
Investors interested in taking delivery of Physical Gold in exchange for their shares in the Trust must first contact Gold Corporation to discuss the types of Physical Gold, availability dates, product premiums, delivery fees, and suitable delivery locations and methods.
 
To proceed, an investor must provide Gold Corporation with sufficient details to enable Gold Corporation to identify the investor as a person owning a beneficial interest in any shares of the Trust (“Beneficial Owner”) and to establish a Customer Account for the investor with Gold Corporation. Gold Corporation may determine (in its absolute discretion) whether the investor has provided sufficient details to identify the investor as a Beneficial Owner and to open the Customer Account with Gold Corporation. The Customer Account is established in Australia and is governed by the laws of the State of Western Australia and applicable laws of the Commonwealth of Australia. To the extent that an investor wishes to maintain a Gold Corporation account to hold Physical Gold on an ongoing basis, the investor will have online account access to conduct transactions with respect to gold in the investor’s account.
 
Based upon this discussion with Gold Corporation, the investor is provided a pre-populated Application, including any applicable product premiums, delivery fees and any other fees and charges that apply to the Application. Gold Corporation is entitled to receive all such premiums, fees and charges in consideration for facilitating the delivery of the agreed Physical Gold products to the investor. The Application will set forth the number of shares to be delivered to Gold Corporation for the amount of Physical Gold requested. The investor shall be responsible for any applicable taxes or governmental charges. The Application will also contain a Delivery ID and the investor’s Customer Account number with Gold Corporation.
 
Investors interested in taking delivery of Physical Gold in exchange for their shares in the Trust must duly sign and submit the Application to Gold Corporation within the Quotation Window. An Application expresses the investor’s intention to deliver shares for Physical Gold on the Share Submission Day. The investor must also provide instructions to his or her broker-dealer to effect the exchange of shares for Physical Gold on the Share Submission Day. Gold Corporation may reject any Application. An Application may be found on the website www.aaauetf.com.
 
Minimum Purity of Bars for Exchange
 
Gold Corporation will supply, for the purpose of delivery to investors requesting Physical Gold, coins, cast bars and minted bars without numismatic value having a minimum fineness (or purity) of 995 parts per 1,000 (99.5%).
Delivery Amount and Share Submission Quantity
 
The pre-populated Application specifies the type and quantity of Physical Gold to be delivered and the number of shares to be tendered in exchange. The Share Submission Quantity corresponds to the Fine Ounce content of Physical Gold requested and shall equal a whole number of shares representing an aggregate number of Fine Ounces equal to the Physical Gold requested plus any applicable product premiums and delivery fees. The transaction will involve no payments of cash and will be wholly-settled in shares.
 
Gold Corporation publishes on its website a calculator to estimate the amount of Physical Gold to be received in exchange for a certain number of shares to be delivered. Any such estimate shall be non-binding on the investor and Gold Corporation. The Share Submission Quantity may be rejected if Gold Corporation incurs extraordinary expenses between the submission of the Application and the Share Submission Day.
 
In the event the investor transfers a number of shares not corresponding to the Application, the investor must make any arrangements directly with Gold Corporation and Gold Corporation reserves the right to reject the initial quote, and any additional costs incurred by Gold Corporation as a result of an incorrect number of shares being delivered will be borne by the investor. Gold Corporation may decline to approve the Application for any reason. In addition, the delivery of Physical Gold in exchange for shares shall be suspended in the event Gold Corporation resigns as Custodial Sponsor or is otherwise unable or unwilling to accept applications from investors to take delivery of Physical Gold.
 
Product Premiums and Other Charges
 
The exchange of shares for the delivery of Physical Gold is subject to prevailing product prices, which are disclosed on the Trust’s website, and the delivery fees associated with the transport of Physical Gold to investors, subject to transport providers’ rates from time to time. Product prices will be based on the type of Physical Gold that is being requested.
 
The Trust’s website contains a calculator to provide shareholders an estimate of the number of shares to be exchanged for the various products offered. Such fees will be expressed in terms of the number of Shares to be delivered to the Gold Corporation for the amount of Physical Gold requested. Such fees will be provided to an investor as part of the pre-populated Application. The number of ounces represented by the shares delivered will generally be higher than the amount of ounces of gold to be delivered, because the number of shares delivered will also cover delivery charges and product premiums.

The transfer of shares, accompanied by the approved Application, is a binding and irrevocable request to take delivery of Physical Gold in exchange for shares based on instructions in the Application. In the event the investor transfers a number of shares not corresponding to the Application, the investor must make any arrangements directly with Gold Corporation, and Gold Corporation reserves the right to reject the initial quote and any additional costs incurred by Gold Corporation as a result of an incorrect number of shares being delivered will be borne by the investor. Gold Corporation may decline to approve the Application for any reason.

Gold Corporation shall arrange for and promptly ship the requested Physical Gold to the investor in accordance with the instructions provided by the investor in the Application. Prior to signing an acknowledgment of receipt of Physical Gold, the investor must notify Gold Corporation in writing of any complaints or objections concerning the shipment, delivery or receipt of the Physical Gold. Upon signing the acknowledgment of receipt, the investor will be deemed to have accepted receipt of the Physical Gold in full satisfaction of the Physical Gold due the investor and to have waived any and all claims the investor may have concerning the Physical Gold received by the investor.
 
Anti-Money Laundering Screening
 
Gold Corporation will comply with all relevant anti-money laundering requirements in connection with its processing of each Application for Delivery of Physical Gold. Investors may be subject to Anti-Money Laundering screening in connection with Australian anti-money laundering laws when they submit the Application to take delivery of Physical Gold. Gold Corporation will not pre-approve an Application if Gold Corporation has concerns about fraudulent conduct or money laundering activity. Corporate and non-U.S. investors are cautioned that their Applications may be delayed or rejected if Gold Corporation is not able to verify the identity of the investor.
Tax Responsibility
 
Investors are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or other governmental charge applicable to the receipt of gold, regardless of whether such tax or charge is imposed directly on the investor. Each investor agrees to indemnify the Sponsors, the Trustee and the Trust, promptly on request, if any of them is required by law to pay any such tax or charge, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.
