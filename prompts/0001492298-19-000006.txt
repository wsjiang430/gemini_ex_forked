ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 We operate as a self-administered, self-managed REIT that, through our subsidiaries, owns and invests in real estate serving the healthcare industry. Our primary business consists of acquiring, financing and owning real estate property to be leased to third party tenants in the healthcare sector. We primarily generate revenues by leasing properties to tenants and owning properties operated by third-party property managers throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada. 
On August 17, 2017, we completed our merger with CCP, as a result of which we acquired 330 properties (consisting of 296 skilled nursing/transitional care facilities, 13 senior housing communities and 21 specialty hospitals and other facilities), one skilled nursing/transitional care facility leased to an operator under a direct financing lease, 18 investments in loans receivable and one specialty valuation firm that we subsequently sold in March 2018. We also assumed certain outstanding equity awards and other debt and liabilities of CCP. See Note 3, “CCP Merger and Recent Real Estate Acquisitions,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
On January 2, 2018, we completed our transaction with affiliates of Enlivant and TPG Real Estate, the real estate platform of TPG, to acquire a 49% equity interest in an entity that owns 172 senior housing communities managed by Enlivant (the “Enlivant Joint Venture”). The joint venture agreement includes an option for us to acquire the remainder of the outstanding equity interests in the Enlivant Joint Venture by January 2, 2021 and grants us the right of first offer if our partner in the Enlivant Joint Venture desires to transfer its equity interest (which it may do commencing on January 2, 2020). Additionally on January 2, 2018, we acquired 11 senior housing communities under the Senior Housing - Managed structure that are operated by Enlivant pursuant to property management agreements. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Enlivant Joint Venture” in Part II, Item 7 for additional information.
As of December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted of 470 real estate properties held for investment (consisting of (i) 335 skilled nursing/transitional care facilities, (ii) 90 senior housing communities (“Senior Housing - Leased”), (iii) 23 senior housing communities operated by third-party property managers pursuant to property management agreements (“Senior Housing - Managed”) and (iv) 22 specialty hospitals and other facilities), one investment in a direct financing lease, 22 investments in loans receivable (consisting of (i) one mortgage loan, (ii) two construction loans, (iii) one mezzanine loan and (iv) 18 other loans), nine preferred equity investments and one investment in an unconsolidated joint venture. As of December 31, 2018, our real estate properties held for investment included 47,648 beds/units, spread across the U.S. and Canada. As of December 31, 2018, the substantial majority of our real estate properties (excluding 23 Senior Housing - Managed communities) were leased under triple-net operating leases with expirations ranging from one to 15 years. 
We expect to continue to grow our investment portfolio while diversifying our portfolio by tenant, facility type and geography within the healthcare sector. We plan to achieve these objectives primarily through making investments directly or indirectly in healthcare real estate, including the development of purpose-built healthcare facilities with select developers. We also intend to achieve our objective of diversifying our portfolio by tenant and facility type through select asset sales and other arrangements with Genesis and with other tenants. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the sale of 58 facilities, including 43 facilities leased to Genesis. We have entered into agreements to sell three of our remaining 11 Genesis facilities, and we expect to retain eight facilities. The three facilities are being sold subject to HUD-insured debt, and the sales are expected to close upon approval by HUD. In addition, we have entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell 26 skilled nursing/transitional care facilities and two senior housing communities (together, the “Senior Care Centers Sale Facilities”) currently operated by Senior Care Centers. We plan to retain the remaining 10 facilities (the “Retained Facilities”) currently operated by Senior Care Centers and re-lease those facilities to one or more new operators. We expect to complete the sale and transition of the 28 and 10 facilities currently operated by Senior Care Centers, respectively, on April 1, 2019, subject to customary closing conditions including approval of operations transfer and related agreements by the bankruptcy court overseeing a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code filed by Senior Care Centers. There can be no assurances that the sale of the Senior Care Centers Sale Facilities or the transition of the Retained Facilities will be consummated, on the foregoing terms or timing or at all.
We employ a disciplined, opportunistic approach in our healthcare real estate investment strategy by investing in assets that provide attractive opportunities for dividend growth and appreciation of asset values, while maintaining balance sheet strength and liquidity, thereby creating long-term stockholder value.
We were incorporated on May 10, 2010 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. (“Sun”) and commenced operations on November 15, 2010 following our separation from Sun (the “Separation Date”). We elected to be 
 4

treated as a REIT with the filing of our U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2011. We believe that we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in a manner to qualify as a REIT. 
Our principal executive offices are located at 18500 Von Karman Avenue, Suite 550, Irvine, CA 92612, and our telephone number is (888) 393-8248. We maintain a website at www.sabrahealth.com. Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. files reports with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We will make such filings available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after such information has been filed or furnished with the SEC. 
Our Industry 
We operate as a REIT that holds investments in income-producing healthcare facilities located in the U.S. and Canada. We invest primarily in the U.S. nursing home industry, including skilled nursing and transitional care facilities, the U.S. and Canadian senior housing industry, which includes independent living, assisted living, memory care and continuing care retirement communities and select behavioral, acute care and other hospitals. The primary growth drivers of these industries – an aging population and longer life expectancies – present attractive investment opportunities for us. According to the 2014 National Population Projections published by the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans over the age of 75 is projected to be the fastest growing segment of the population, growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 2.9% between 2015 and 2020 and 3.6% between 2015 and 2025. According to the same publication, life expectancy is expected to increase to 81.7 years in 2030 from 79.4 years in 2015. Furthermore, the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care, a leading industry data provider, estimates that as of the fourth quarter of 2017, only 12.8% of nursing home and senior housing properties were owned by publicly traded REITs. The highly-fragmented nature of the skilled nursing and senior housing industries presents additional investment opportunities.
Demand for senior housing is expected to increase as a result of an aging population and an increase in acuity across the post-acute landscape. Cost containment measures adopted by the federal government have encouraged patient treatment in more cost-effective settings, such as skilled nursing facilities. As a result, high acuity patients that previously would have been treated in long-term acute care hospitals and inpatient rehabilitation facilities are increasingly being treated in skilled nursing facilities. According to the National Health Expenditure Projections for 2017-2026 published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), nursing home expenditures are projected to grow from approximately $168 billion in 2017 to approximately $261 billion in 2026, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 5.0%. This focus on high acuity patients in skilled nursing facilities has resulted in the typical senior housing resident requiring more assistance with activities for daily living, such as assistance with bathing, grooming, dressing, eating, and medication management; however, many older senior housing communities were not built to accommodate a resident who has more needs as well as increased mobility and cognitive issues than in the past. We believe that these trends will create an emphasis on operators who can effectively adapt their operating model to accommodate the changing nursing home patient and senior housing resident and will result in increased demand for purpose-built properties that are complementary to this new system of healthcare delivery.
The hospital industry is broadly defined to include acute care, long-term acute care, rehabilitation and behavioral hospitals. Hospital services comprise one of the largest categories of healthcare expenditures. According to the CMS National Health Expenditure Projections for 2017-2026, hospital care expenditures are projected to grow from approximately $1.1 trillion in 2017 to approximately $1.8 trillion in 2026, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 5.6%. Hospitals offer a wide range of services, both inpatient and outpatient, in a variety of settings. We believe that demand will increase for innovative means of delivering those services and present additional investment opportunities.
Portfolio of Healthcare Investments
We have a geographically diverse portfolio of healthcare investments across the U.S. and Canada that offer a range of services including skilled nursing/transitional care, assisted and independent living, mental health and acute care. As of December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted of 470 real estate properties held for investment, one investment in a direct financing lease, 22 investments in loans receivable, nine preferred equity investments and one investment in an unconsolidated joint venture. Of our 470 properties held for investment as of December 31, 2018, we owned fee title to 463 properties and title under ground leases for seven properties. 
Our portfolio consisted of the following types of healthcare facilities as of December 31, 2018: 

• | Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care Facilities

Skilled nursing facilities. Skilled nursing facilities provide services that include daily nursing, therapeutic rehabilitation, social services, activities, housekeeping, nutrition and administrative services for individuals 
 5

requiring certain assistance for activities in daily living. A typical skilled nursing facility includes mostly one and two bed units, each equipped with a private or shared bathroom and community dining facilities. 
Mental health facilities. Mental health facilities provide a range of inpatient and outpatient behavioral health services for adults and children through specialized treatment programs.
Transitional care facilities/units. Transitional care facilities/units are licensed nursing facilities or distinct units within a licensed nursing facility that provide short term, intensive, high acuity nursing and medical services. These facilities tend to focus on delivering specialized treatment to patients with cardiac, neurological, pulmonary, orthopedic, and renal conditions. Length of service is typically 30 days or less with the majority of patients returning to prior living arrangements and functional abilities. Generally, transitional care facilities/units provide services to Medicare, managed care and commercial insurance patients.

• | Senior Housing Communities


Independent living communities. Independent living communities are age-restricted multi-family properties with central dining facilities that provide services that include security, housekeeping, activities, nutrition and limited laundry services. Our independent living communities are designed specifically for independent seniors who are able to live on their own, but desire the security and conveniences of community living. Independent living communities typically offer several services covered under a regular monthly fee.
Assisted living communities. Assisted living communities provide services that include assistance for activities in daily living and permit residents to maintain some of their privacy and independence as they do not require constant supervision and assistance. Services bundled within one regular monthly fee usually include three meals per day in a central dining room, daily housekeeping, laundry, medical reminders and 24-hour availability of assistance with the activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing and bathing. Professional nursing and healthcare services are usually available at the community on call or at regularly scheduled times. Assisted living communities typically are comprised of one and two bedroom suites equipped with private bathrooms and efficiency kitchens.
Memory care communities. Memory care communities offer specialized options, services and clinical programs for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. Purpose-built, free-standing memory care communities offer a more residential environment than offered in a secured unit of a nursing facility. These communities offer dedicated care and specialized programming from specially trained staff for various conditions relating to memory loss in a secured environment that is typically smaller in scale and more residential in nature than traditional assisted living communities. Residents require a higher level of care, a secure environment, customized therapeutic recreation programs and more assistance with activities of daily living than in assisted living communities. Therefore, these communities have staff available 24 hours a day to respond to the unique needs of their residents.
Continuing care retirement communities. Continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs, provide, as a continuum of care, the services described above for independent living communities, assisted living communities and skilled nursing facilities in an integrated campus.

• | Specialty Hospitals and Other Facilities

Acute care hospitals. Acute care hospitals provide emergency room, inpatient and outpatient medical care and other related services for surgery, acute medical conditions or injuries (usually for a short-term illness or condition).
Long-term acute care hospitals. Long-term acute care hospitals provide care for patients with complex medical conditions that require longer stays and more intensive care, monitoring or emergency back-up than that available in most skilled nursing facilities.
Rehabilitation hospitals. Rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients who have sustained traumatic injuries or illnesses, such as spinal cord injuries, strokes, head injuries, orthopedic problems, work-related disabilities and neurological diseases.
Behavioral hospitals. Behavioral hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients with mental health conditions, chemical dependence or substance addictions.
Residential services facilities. Residential services facilities provide services in home and community-based settings, which may include assistance with activities of daily living.
 6

Other facilities. Other facilities include facilities other than those described above that are not classified as skilled nursing/transitional care or senior housing.

See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Concentration of Credit Risk” in Part II, Item 7 for additional information, including risks and uncertainties, regarding tenant concentration.
Investment Financing Strategy 
We intend to invest in additional healthcare properties as suitable opportunities arise and adequate sources of financing are available. We expect that future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly-acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed, in whole or in part, by our existing cash, borrowings available to us under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), future borrowings or the proceeds from issuances of common stock, preferred stock, debt or other securities. In addition, we may seek financing from U.S. government agencies, including through Fannie Mae and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), in appropriate circumstances in connection with acquisitions. We also use derivative instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk. 
Competitive Strengths 
We believe the following competitive strengths contribute significantly to our success: 
Diverse Property Portfolio 
Our portfolio of 470 properties held for investment as of December 31, 2018 is broadly diversified by location across the U.S. and Canada. Our properties in any one state or province did not account for more than 19% of our total beds/units as of December 31, 2018. Our geographic diversification will limit the effect of a decline in any one regional market on our overall performance. The annual occupancy percentages of our stabilized properties over the last three fiscal years ranged between 82.8% and 86.5% for our skilled nursing/transitional care facilities, between 86.7% and 89.5% for our Senior Housing - Leased communities, between 75.5% and 91.5% for our Senior Housing - Managed communities and between 69.7% and 89.6% for our specialty hospitals and other facilities. We have also been able to diversify, through acquisitions and dispositions, the extent to which our revenues are dependent on our tenants’, borrowers’ and equity investees’ revenues from federal, state and local government reimbursement programs. Based on the information provided to us by our tenants and borrowers, which information is provided quarterly in arrears, on an annualized basis as of December 31, 2018, 58.0% of our tenants’, borrowers’ and equity investees’ revenue was from federal, state and local government reimbursement programs.
Long-Term, Triple-Net Lease Structure 
As of December 31, 2018, the substantial majority of our real estate properties held for investment (excluding 23 Senior Housing - Managed communities) were leased under triple-net operating leases with expirations ranging from one to 15 years, pursuant to which the tenants are responsible for all facility maintenance, insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties and all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. As of December 31, 2018, the leases had a weighted-average remaining term of nine years. The leases generally include provisions to extend the lease terms and other negotiated terms and conditions. We retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the real estate assets leased to tenants. We may receive additional security under these operating leases in the form of letters of credit and security deposits from the lessee or guarantees from the parent of the lessee or other parties related to the lessee. In addition, certain of our tenants have deposited amounts with us for future real estate taxes, insurance expenditures and tenant improvements related to our properties and their operations.
Senior Housing - Managed Structure
As of December 31, 2018, our real estate properties held for investment included 23 Senior Housing - Managed communities operated by four third-party property managers pursuant to property management agreements. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Enlivant Joint Venture owned 172 Senior Housing - Managed communities managed by Enlivant. The Senior Housing - Managed structure gives us direct exposure to the risks and benefits of the operations of the communities. We generally utilize the Senior Housing - Managed structure when properties present growth opportunities that may be achievable through capital investment and/or property managers providing scale, operating efficiencies and/or ancillary services. The third-party property managers manage our communities in exchange for the receipt of a management fee, and as such, we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of the property managers in the same manner or to the same extent as we are to our triple-net tenants. However, we rely on the property managers’ personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our communities efficiently and effectively. We also rely on the property managers to set appropriate resident fees and otherwise operate our communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations.

Strong Relationships with Operators 
The members of our management team have developed an extensive network of relationships with qualified local, regional and national operators of skilled nursing/transitional care facilities and senior housing communities across the U.S. and Canada. This extensive network has been built by our management team through more than 100 years of combined operating experience, involvement in industry trade organizations and the development of banking relationships and investor relations within the skilled nursing and senior housing industries. We believe these strong relationships with operators help us to source investment opportunities.
Our relationships with operators include pipeline agreements that we have entered into with certain operators that provide for the acquisition of, and interim capital commitments for, various healthcare facilities. These pipeline agreements, together with repeat transactions with other operators, help support our future growth potential by providing additional investment opportunities with lower acquisition costs than would be required for investments with new operators. 
Ability to Identify Talented Operators 
As a result of our management team’s operating experience, network of relationships and industry insight, we have been able and expect to continue to be able to identify qualified local, regional and national operators. We seek operators who possess local market knowledge, demonstrate hands-on management, have proven track records and emphasize patient care. These operators are often located in secondary markets, which generally have lower costs to build and favorable demographics as demonstrated by the fact that the percentage of the population over the age of 65 is greater in the markets where we have invested than in the U.S. as a whole. We believe our management team’s experience gives us a key competitive advantage in objectively evaluating an operator’s financial position, emphasis on care and operating efficiency.
Significant Experience in Proactive Asset Management 
The members of our management team have significant experience developing systems to collect and evaluate data relating to the underlying operational and financial success of healthcare companies and healthcare-related real estate assets. We are able to utilize this experience and expertise to provide our operators, when requested, with significant assistance in the areas of marketing, development, facility expansion and strategic planning. We have also developed a proprietary information technology system that allows us to efficiently and effectively collect tenant, financial, asset management and acquisitions information. Leveraging this system allows us to be lean in our operations and proactive in sharing information with our tenants and operators where we can be helpful to them. We actively monitor the operating results of our tenants and, when requested, will work closely with our operators to identify and capitalize on opportunities to improve the operations of our facilities and the overall financial and operating strength of our operators.
Experienced Management Team 
Our management team has extensive healthcare and real estate experience. Richard K. Matros, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sabra, has more than 30 years of experience in the acquisition, development and disposition of healthcare assets, including nine years at Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. Harold W. Andrews, Jr., Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of Sabra, is a finance professional with more than 20 years of experience in both the provision of healthcare services and healthcare real estate. Talya Nevo-Hacohen, Executive Vice President, Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer of Sabra, is a real estate finance executive with more than 25 years of experience in real estate finance, acquisition and development, including three years of experience managing and implementing the capital markets strategy of an S&P 500 healthcare REIT. Through years of public company experience, our management team also has extensive experience accessing both debt and equity capital markets to fund growth and maintain a flexible capital structure.
Business Strategies 
We pursue business strategies focused on opportunistic acquisitions and property diversification where such acquisitions meet our investing and financing strategy. We also intend to further develop our relationships with tenants and healthcare providers with a goal to progressively expand the mixture of tenants managing and operating our properties.
The key components of our business strategies include: 
Diversify Asset Portfolio 
We expect to continue to grow our portfolio primarily through the acquisition of assisted living, independent living and memory care communities in the U.S. and Canada and through the acquisition of skilled nursing/transitional care and behavioral health facilities in the U.S. We have and expect to continue to opportunistically acquire other types of healthcare real estate, originate financing secured directly or indirectly by healthcare facilities and invest in the development of senior housing

communities and skilled nursing/transitional care facilities. We also expect to expand our portfolio through the development of purpose-built healthcare facilities through pipeline agreements and other arrangements with select developers. We further expect to work with existing operators to identify strategic development opportunities. These opportunities may involve replacing, renovating or expanding facilities in our portfolio that may have become less competitive and new development opportunities that present attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition to pursuing acquisitions with triple-net leases, we expect to continue to pursue other forms of investment, including investments in Senior Housing - Managed communities, mezzanine and secured debt investments, and joint ventures for senior housing communities and skilled nursing/transitional care facilities. We also expect to continue to enhance the strength of our investment portfolio by selectively disposing of underperforming facilities or working with new or existing operators to transfer underperforming but promising properties to new operators.
With respect to our debt and preferred equity investments, in general, we originate loans and make preferred equity investments when an attractive investment opportunity is presented and (a) the property is in or near the development phase, (b) the development of the property is completed but the operations of the facility are not yet stabilized or (c) the loan investment will provide capital to existing relationships. A key component of our development strategy related to loan originations and preferred equity investments is having the option to purchase the underlying real estate that is owned by our borrowers (and that directly or indirectly secures our loan investments) or by the entity in which we have an investment. These options become exercisable upon the occurrence of various criteria, such as the passage of time or the achievement of certain operating goals, and the method to determine the purchase price upon exercise of the option is set in advance based on the same valuation methods we use to value our investments in healthcare real estate. This proprietary development pipeline strategy allows us to diversify our revenue streams and build relationships with operators and developers, and provides us with the option to add new properties to our existing real estate portfolio if we determine that those properties enhance our investment portfolio and stockholder value at the time the options are exercisable.
Maintain Balance Sheet Strength and Liquidity 
We seek to maintain a capital structure that provides the resources and flexibility to support the growth of our business. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $426.0 million in liquidity, consisting of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $50.0 million (excluding joint venture cash and cash equivalents), and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of $376.0 million. The Credit Facility (as defined below) also contains an accordion feature that can increase the total available borrowings to $2.5 billion (up from U.S. $2.1 billion plus CAD $125.0 million), subject to terms and conditions.
We have filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that expires in January 2020, which allows us to offer and sell shares of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, units, and certain of our subsidiaries to offer and sell debt securities, through underwriters, dealers or agents or directly to purchasers, on a continuous or delayed basis, in amounts, at prices and on terms we determine at the time of the offering, subject to market conditions. 
We intend to maintain a mix of Credit Facility debt, term loan debt, secured debt and unsecured term debt, which, together with our anticipated ability to complete future equity financings, we expect will fund the growth of our operations. Further, we may opportunistically seek access to U.S. government agency financing, including through Fannie Mae and HUD, in appropriate circumstances in connection with acquisitions. 
Develop New Investment Relationships 
We seek to cultivate our relationships with tenants and healthcare providers in order to expand the mix of tenants operating our properties and, in doing so, to reduce our dependence on any single tenant or operator. We have grown our investment relationships from one in 2010 to 70 as of December 31, 2018. We expect to continue to develop new investment relationships as part of our overall strategy to acquire new properties and further diversify our overall portfolio of healthcare properties. 
Capital Source to Underserved Operators 
We believe that there is a significant opportunity to be a capital source to healthcare operators through the acquisition of healthcare properties that are consistent with our investment and financing strategy, but that, due to size and other considerations, are not a focus for other healthcare REITs. We utilize our management team’s operating experience, network of relationships and industry insight to identify financially strong and growing operators in need of capital funding for future growth. In appropriate circumstances, we may negotiate with operators to acquire individual healthcare properties from those operators and then lease those properties back to the operators pursuant to long-term triple-net leases or refinance new projects.

Strategic Capital Improvements 
We intend to continue to support operators by providing capital to them for a variety of purposes, including for capital expenditures and facility modernization. We expect to structure these investments as either lease amendments that produce additional rents or as loans that are repaid by operators during the applicable lease term. 
Pursue Strategic Development Opportunities 
We expect to work with existing operators to identify strategic development opportunities. These opportunities may involve replacing, renovating or expanding facilities in our portfolio that may have become less competitive and new development opportunities that present attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition to pursuing acquisitions with triple-net leases, we expect to continue to pursue other forms of investment, including investments in Senior Housing - Managed communities, mezzanine and secured debt investments, and joint ventures for senior housing and skilled nursing/transitional care facilities.
 Our Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 31 full-time employees, including our executive officers, none of whom is subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
Competition 
We compete for real property investments with other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders and other investors. Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition makes it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives. Our ability to compete is also impacted by national and local economic trends, availability of investment alternatives, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, existing laws and regulations, new legislation and population trends. 
In addition, revenues from our properties are dependent on the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with other healthcare operators. These operators compete on a local and regional basis for residents and patients, and the operators’ ability to successfully attract and retain residents and patients depends on key factors such as the number of facilities in the local market, the types of services available, the quality of care, reputation, age and appearance of each facility, and the cost of care in each locality. Private, federal and state payment programs and the effect of other laws and regulations may also have a significant impact on the ability of our tenants and operators to compete successfully for residents and patients at the properties.
Government Regulation 
Our tenants are subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations, including anti-kickback, anti-fraud and abuse provisions codified under the Social Security Act. These provisions prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare and Medicaid. Sanctions for violating these anti-kickback, anti-fraud and abuse provisions include criminal penalties, civil sanctions, fines and possible exclusion from government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. If a facility is decertified as a Medicare or Medicaid provider by CMS or a state, the facility will not thereafter be reimbursed for caring for residents that are covered by Medicare and Medicaid, and the facility would be forced to care for such residents without being reimbursed or to transfer such residents.
Most of our tenants’ skilled nursing/transitional care, assisted living and mental health facilities are licensed under applicable state law. Most of our skilled nursing/transitional care facilities and mental health facilities are certified or approved as providers under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Some of our assisted living facilities are certified or approved as providers under various state Medicaid and/or Medicaid waiver programs. Similarly, the operators of our specialty hospitals must meet the applicable conditions of participation established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and comply with state and local laws and regulations in order to receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. State and local agencies survey all skilled nursing/transitional care facilities and some assisted living facilities on a regular basis to determine whether such facilities are in compliance with governmental operating and health standards and conditions for participation in government sponsored third party payor programs. Under certain circumstances, the federal and state agencies have the authority to take adverse actions against a facility or service provider, including the imposition of a monitor, the imposition of monetary penalties and the decertification of a facility or provider from participation in the Medicare and/or Medicaid/Medicaid waiver programs or licensure revocation. Challenging and appealing notices or allegations of noncompliance can require significant legal expenses and management attention.

Various states in which our tenants operate our facilities have established minimum staffing requirements or may establish minimum staffing requirements in the future. Failure to comply with such minimum staffing requirements may result in the imposition of fines or other sanctions. Most states in which our tenants operate have statutes requiring that prior to the addition or construction of new nursing home beds, to the addition of new services or to certain capital expenditures in excess of defined levels, the tenant first must obtain a certificate of need, which certifies that the state has made a determination that a need exists for such new or additional beds, new services or capital expenditures. The certification process is intended to promote quality healthcare at the lowest possible cost and to avoid the unnecessary duplication of services, equipment and centers. This certification process can restrict or prohibit the undertaking of a project or lengthen the period of time required to enlarge or renovate a facility or replace a tenant.
In addition to the above, those of our tenants who provide services that are paid for by Medicare and Medicaid are subject to federal and state budgetary cuts and constraints that limit the reimbursement levels available from these government programs. Changes to reimbursement or methods of payment from Medicare and Medicaid could result in a substantial reduction in our tenants’ revenues. On January 20, 2017, the President issued an executive order aimed at seeking the prompt repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “Affordable Care Act”), and on December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which amends certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act.  Amendments to or repeal of the Affordable Care Act and regulatory changes could impose further limitations on government payments to our tenants. On July 31, 2018, CMS issued a final rule, CMS-1696-F, which includes changes to the case-mix classification system used under the Prospective Payment System and fiscal year 2019 Medicare payment updates. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Skilled Nursing Facility Reimbursement Rates” in Part II, Item 7 for additional information.
As of December 31, 2018, our subsidiaries owned 13 healthcare facilities (seven skilled nursing/transitional care facilities and six senior housing communities) with mortgage loans that are guaranteed by HUD. Those facilities are subject to the rules and regulations of HUD, including periodic inspections by HUD, although the tenants of those facilities have the primary responsibility for maintaining the facilities in compliance with HUD’s rules and regulations. The regulatory agreements entered into by each owner and each operator of the property restrict, among other things, any sale or other transfer of the property, modification of the lease between the owner and the operator, use of surplus cash from the property except upon certain conditions and renovations of the property, all without prior HUD approval.
In addition, as an owner of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations address various matters, including asbestos, fuel oil management, wastewater discharges, air emissions, medical wastes and hazardous wastes. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations and the penalties for non-compliance can be substantial. For example, although we do not generally operate or actively manage our properties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean up of any property from which there has been a release or threatened release of a regulated material as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release. In addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property’s value, we could be liable for certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with real estate properties owned by us may materially impair the value of those investments.” in Part I, Item 1A.
