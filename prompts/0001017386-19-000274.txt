General
 
Luvu Brands, Inc. designs, manufactures and markets a portfolio of consumer lifestyle brands through the Company’s websites, online mass merchants and specialty retail stores worldwide. Brands include: Liberator®, a brand category of iconic products for enhancing sensuality and intimacy; Avana®, inclined bed therapy products, assistive in relieving medical conditions associated with acid reflux, surgery recovery and chronic pain; and Jaxx®, a diverse range of casual fashion daybeds, sofas and beanbags made from virgin and re-purposed polyurethane foam. Many of our products are offered flat-packed and vacuum compressed to save on shipping and reduce our carbon footprint. The Company is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia in a 140,000 square foot vertically-integrated manufacturing facility that employs over 170 people. Bringing sewn products manufacturing back to the USA and creating innovative consumer brands are core to the Company's operating principles.
 
 In addition to wholesale sales channels, the Company also markets and distributes its products directly to consumers through several websites that include:  liberator.com, jaxxliving.com, and avanacomfort.com. We reach additional consumers through a retail concept store located within our Atlanta factory.
 
Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to the “Company,” “Luvu Brands,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refers to Luvu Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 
Our executive offices are located at 2745 Bankers Industrial Dr., Atlanta, GA 30360; our telephone number is +1-770-246-6400. 

Corporate History
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Florida on February 25, 1999, under the name of WES Consulting, Inc. On October 19, 2009, the Company entered into a Merger and Recapitalization Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with Liberator, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Old Liberator”).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Old Liberator merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as the sole remaining entity (the “Merger”). On February 28, 2011, the Company name was changed from WES Consulting, Inc. to Liberator, Inc.
 
Effective November 5, 2015, the Company changed its corporate name from Liberator, Inc. to Luvu Brands, Inc. to reflect its broader offering of wellness and lifestyle products designed for mass market channels.
 Overview of our Facilities and Operations
 
Since inception we have used a vertically integrated business model, with manufacturing, distribution, product development and marketing performed in-house. We believe this allows us to create new products with reduced lead times at a lower cost while enabling us to quickly respond to market and customer demands for our existing products. For our wholesale accounts, being able to fulfill large orders with shorter turnaround times allows us to capture business during December and February when wholesale customers make just-in-time holiday purchases.
 
Our 140,000 square foot facility on eight acres is located in a suburb of metro Atlanta, Georgia and includes manufacturing and distribution, sales and marketing, product development, customer service and administrative staff. All of the Liberator, Jaxx and Avana branded products are designed, produced and marketed from our facility in Atlanta, Georgia where we currently employ 170 people. As of the date of this report, the Company employs 134 people in Production and Distribution, 2 people in Product Development, 16 people in Sales and Marketing, and 18 people in Administration. The Company’s employment levels may change seasonally based on current and anticipated order levels.
 
Our Atlanta-based manufacturing operation has two CAD controlled fabric cutters, one CAD controlled wood cutter, one CAD controlled foam contouring machine and two state-of-the-art conveyor unit production sewing systems. Our sewing equipment is also highly automated with conveyor based lines leading into vacuum and roll compression packaging of finished products. We believe that our in-house manufacturing capabilities have enabled us to achieve greater efficiencies and cost savings, as well as strict control over the entire manufacturing cycle including raw material procurement, finished goods production and logistics optimization. In addition to providing us with greater production flexibility, our in-house manufacturing provides us with the opportunity to improve fulfillment response time, reduces the risk of out-of-stock situations, limits finished goods obsolescence and improves overall operating margins.

Because cutting, sewing, foam contouring, assembly and vacuum packaging are performed in-house, we believe we can exercise greater control over product quality and respond faster to changing customer demands, which gives us a competitive advantage over companies that utilize out-sourced sewing services. We can source raw materials from multiple domestic and foreign suppliers and we have supply contracts in place to produce our specialty fabrics under specific quality control and performance standards with just-in-time deliveries.
 
During fiscal 2018, we expanded the conveyor sewing system for our Jaxx and Avana products and, in the second half of fiscal 2018, we installed new roll pack and compression equipment used for the majority of our foam-based products. All of these actions resulted in increased throughput and lower production costs in these operations. However, these operational improvements were offset in fiscal 2019 by increases in wages and raw materials costs, resulting in lower overall margins.
 
All business activity of the Company is done through our wholly-owned subsidiary, OneUp Innovations, Inc. (“OneUp”). OneUp was organized in 2000 and began operations in 2002.



Business Strategy
 
Our goals are to achieve long-term growth and profitability and diversify our sales base. We plan to achieve these goals using the following strategies:
 

· Delivering value to our customers. Our primary goal is to deliver the highest value to every customer, before, during and after they purchase a product from us. This means designing relevant products with the most utility and benefit, creating an informative and efficient buying experience, and delivering on our promises. We believe that serving the customer is the center of everything we do, and by doing so we create value for our customers and wealth for our shareholders. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· Manufacturing. To improve our business results, we constantly look for ways to manage the impact of rising raw material and labor costs by improving the productivity of our manufacturing processes. The recent production equipment purchases should continue to yield higher gross profit as a result of the lower cost of goods sold. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· Wholesale Operations. Our goal is to increase consumer demand through advertising and public relations while our wholesale operations expand our offering to distributors, retailers and e-tailers across every channel of adult, mass market, drug and specialty accounts. For wholesalers thinking about adding Sexual Wellness products to their retail or online store, our Liberator product line is typically one of the first “safer” products presented, as it can be promoted as an assistive aid to sexual positioning. As the mainstream demand for Sexual Wellness products grows, our sales staff is training and educating new resellers on how to get started in this category. For retail display, we offer mainstream packaging in a variety of sizes and price points to meet their customers particular demographic. For e-tailers, we maintain brand continuity by providing rich product content, photography and instructional videos for use on their websites. We also provide fulfillment services and can drop-ship orders directly to their customer, typically the same day the order is received. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· Eco-Packaging. In fiscal 2013, we developed vacuum compressed packaging to reduce our carbon foot print, make our products more convenient for the consumer and easier to display for the retailer, and reduce our outbound shipping costs. During fiscal 2014, we expanded the number of products that used Eco-Packaging to include all foam-based products. In fiscal 2015, we further vacuum compressed our products to even smaller sizes while adding more product marketing information to our retail consumer packages. In fiscal 2018 and 2019, the new roll pack compression equipment expanded the number of products offered in smaller boxes. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· Liberator Concept Store. Our 2,500 square foot Liberator exhibition store is the retail extension of our Liberator.com website. Located at our Atlanta factory, it is a gallery-like setting for sensual and erotic discovery, offering a presentation of products that celebrate intimacy and romantic imagination. In our opinion, Liberator and luxury pleasure objects are meant to go together. Our concept store is a destination where customers can learn about, touch and purchase the Liberator products. In addition to Liberator branded shapes, furniture and accessories, the store features a range of better brands from around the globe including: designer sex toys, masks, cuffs and intimate accessories. Also included are limited edition hand-made items in glass and leather. The store also serves as a laboratory to listen and observe consumer reaction to new products and evaluate price points and merchandising techniques.

Products, Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution
 
Liberator Products
 
We developed a product category which we call “Liberator Bedroom Adventure Gear”®. Many of the pieces in this product line are designed to elevate, rock and create surfaces and textures that expand the sexual repertoire and make the act of love more exciting. Liberator Bedroom Adventure Gear combines functional design with sensuous textures that transform ordinary bedrooms into supportive landscapes for intimacy. Liberator products present angles, elevations, curves and motion that help people of all sizes, including those with back injuries and other medical conditions, find comfortable ways to connect intimately while assisting their stamina and performance.
 
 Liberator foam-based products (called “Liberator Shapes”) are manufactured in a variety of heights and widths to accommodate variations in the human body. They consist of differently shaped cushions and props that are available in an assortment of fabric colors to add to the visual excitement. Each of the product profiles of the Liberator Shapes is unique, designed to introduce positions to the sexual experience that were previously difficult to achieve or impossible to achieve with standard pillows or cushions. Liberator Shapes are manufactured from structured polyurethane foam, cut at various angles, platforms and profiles. The foam base is encased in a tight, fluid resistant polyester shell, helping the cushions to maintain their shape.  The original offering of the Liberator Wedge® and Ramp®, sold as a set, continue to be our best-selling items. Many of the Liberator Shapes are also available in our Black Label Series which includes blindfolds and snap-on Velcro cuffs.
 
We have also developed vacuum compressed large profile designs that are commonly referred to as “sex furniture”. Most of the sex furniture pieces are made from contoured urethane foam and covered in a variety of fabrics and colors. These items are marketed as the Esse®, Flip Stage®, Equus Wave® and the Prelude®.  Other larger designs include products based on shredded polyurethane foam encased in a wide range of fabric types and colors and sold under our Zeppelin® product offering. The Liberator larger profile designs can also be used as seating when not being used for relaxed interaction and creative intimacy. Newer designs are also flat-packed with wooden bases and feet.
 
We conduct our wholesale business for Liberator sexual wellness products through four primary channels: (1) adult and female friendly retailers, flash sites and specialty boutiques, (2) e-tailers who sell our products through adult, mass market, drug and other sites offering sexual wellness products, (3) mail order catalogers, and (4) wholesale distributors of adult / sexual wellness products. These wholesale accounts have approximately 950 retail locations and/or websites in the United States and Canada. We have a growing number of retailers who have added a dedicated Liberator exhibition concept to their merchandising space. We also sell our products in Europe through a Netherlands-based third-party fulfillment service.
 
All products sold under the Liberator brand provided 44% of our revenues for our fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
 
Products Purchased for Resale
 
Beginning in 2006, we began importing high-quality pleasure objects from around the world. These resale products provided 10% and 15% of our revenues in each of our fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Jaxx Casual Seating 
 
The Company sells a line of contemporary casual indoor and outdoor seating under the Jaxx® brand. Jaxx beanbags are an offshoot from Liberator manufacturing as it provides additional revenue from repurposing our polyurethane foam trim into shredded beanbag fill. The Jaxx product line also includes solid foam indoor furniture collections and outdoor furniture collections that use polystyrene bead filling. The Jaxx product line and accessory products are sold through the following four wholesale channels: (1) beanbag e-tailers, (2) mass marketers, (3) mail order catalogers, and (4) retail furniture stores. The Company also owns and manages a website under the URL www.JaxxLiving.com for direct to consumer sales of Jaxx products. Jaxx products provided 23% and 22% of our revenues in each of our fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
The contemporary seating business is highly competitive. We believe we can compete effectively on the basis of product quality, design, customer service and price. We believe that our primary competitive advantages are consumer recognition of the Jaxx brand, as well as distribution through the multiple sales channels where consumers prefer to purchase.

Avana Comfort Products
 
The Company also sells a unique collection of comfort products that aid in sleep, meditation, and relaxation under the Avana® brand. The Avana product line is sold through e-merchants, mail order catalogers and through our website under the URL www.AvanaComfort.com. Our Avana products provided 19% and 14% of our revenues in our fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Sales of Avana products increased 39% to $3.2 million in fiscal 2019 over fiscal 2018.
 
Sales and Distribution
 
Our sales personnel are organized by geographic market and by customer type. In North America, we have sales personnel who routinely visit sexual wellness retailers to assist in product training, merchandising and stocking of selling areas. Through our in-house wholesale sales organization, we engage retailers directly and then either ship to them on a wholesale basis or provide fulfillment services by drop-shipping directly to their customers.
 
 In international markets, the Company has a direct sales model with the a US-based salesperson. This salesperson is responsible for wholesale sales, marketing operations and customer service in the European Union and other international markets. Customer orders are filled from our third-party warehouse in the Netherlands or directly from our facilities in Atlanta. Total international sales represented approximately 4% of our total net sales in the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
 
As is customary in the sexual wellness and casual furniture industry, sales to customers are generally made pursuant to purchase orders, and we do not have long-term or exclusive contracts with any of our retail customers or wholesale distributors. We believe that our continuing relationships with our customers are based upon our ability to provide a wide selection and reliable source of sexual wellness and casual furniture products, combined with our expertise in marketing and new product introduction.
 
Internet Websites
 
Since 2002, our Liberator website located at www.Liberator.com has allowed our customers to purchase our Liberator merchandise over the Internet.  We design and operate our websites using an in-house technical and creative staff.
 
Our www.Liberator.com website is intended to be an entertainment and educational venue where consumers can watch product demonstration videos, videos on sexual wellness topics and humorous videos on the many facets of human sexuality.
 
Our www.JaxxLiving.com website offers contemporary indoor and outdoor seating, which is particularly appealing to the young adult and children’s market.
 
Our www.AvanaComfort.com website blends rest, relaxation and health products in an offering that appeals to a broad range of consumers.
 
Our corporate website is www.LuvuBrands.com. There we make available copies of Luvu Brands documents, news releases and our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the “SEC”, including financial statements.
 
Unless specifically set forth to the contrary, the information that appears on our websites is not part of this annual report.
 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
We obtain all of the raw materials and components used to produce our products from outside sources. A number of components, including certain fabrics and zippers, are sourced from suppliers who currently serve as our sole or primary source of supply for these components. We believe we can obtain these raw materials and components from other sources of supply, although we could experience some short-term disruption in our ability to fulfill orders in the event of an unexpected loss of supply from one of the primary suppliers. We utilize dual sourcing on targeted components when effective.
 
Recent changes in U.S. trade policy, including tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States from China, have increased the costs of certain raw materials, parts or components used in our products. Such an increase may materially and adversely affect our sales and our business, as we may increase the selling prices of our products. If any increase in costs of goods cannot be passed on to our customers, our business and gross profit may be materially and adversely affected.

Major Customers
 
Our ten largest customers (excluding our own e-commerce sites and retail store) accounted for approximately 53% of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2019 and 48% of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2018. Sales to (and through) Amazon accounted for 34% of our net sales during the year ended June 30, 2019 and 33% of our sales for the year ended June 30, 2018. The loss of, or a significant adverse change in our relationship with, any of our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Competition
 
We compete with other manufacturers, distributors and marketers of wellness, lifestyle and casual seating, both within and outside the U.S. The sexual wellness and furniture industries are highly fragmented and competition for the sale of such products comes from many sources. These products are sold primarily through retailers (independent retailers, drug store chains, and mass market retailers), distributors, and direct sales channels (internet marketing and mail order companies).
 
For Liberator products, we believe that our primary competitive advantage is consumer recognition of our brand. Due to the strength of our brand, we have no direct competition for the majority of our Liberator branded products. In fact, many e-commerce websites refer to Liberator as a product category and not as a discrete product. And since we sell through multiple sales channels, we provide consumers with the ability to shop for Liberator intimacy products in an environment or website that they are most comfortable in. We also believe that we differentiate ourselves from conventional sexual wellness products based on our utility of design and overall customer satisfaction as it relates to enhanced intimacy.
 
For our Products Purchased for Resale, competition among retailers of adult products and web-based marketers is high. Although we compete with retail, catalog, and internet businesses and now mass and drug retailers that sell sexual wellness products including vibrators, pleasure objects, accessories and similar merchandise, we believe that this opens new channels of distribution for our Liberator products and that we are able to compete favorably as our Liberator products are unique, are couple-centric, and are assistive devices for couples with sexual limitations and issues.
 
For the Liberator e-commerce website, other competitive factors include the effectiveness of our electronic customer mailing lists, maintaining natural search listing, advertising response rates, website design and functionality. The broad range of designs, color choice, fabrics and accessories that we offer helps to differentiate us and allows us to compete favorably against many other adult or sexual wellness websites. Liberator.com also competes against numerous mainstream websites, many of which have a greater volume of web traffic, greater financial strength and marketing resources.
 
 We believe competition in our industries is based on, among other things, the ability to deliver the right product at the right time, product quality and safety, innovation, customer service and price. We believe we compete favorably with other companies because of our ability to provide a broad product offering for customers, our vertically integrated manufacturing operation which allows us to quickly respond to customer demand, our commitment to quality and safety, and our commitment to minimizing our environmental impact.
 
Our future competitive position will likely depend on, but not be limited to, the following:
 

· the continued acceptance of our products by our customers and consumers; 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our patent and trademarks and the continued validity of such intellectual property; 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· our ability to successfully expand our product offerings; 
-------------------------------------------------------------------


· our ability to maintain adequate inventory levels to meet our customers’ demands; 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· our ability to expand; 
--------------------------------


· our ability to continue to manufacture high quality products at competitive prices; 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; 
----------------------------------------------------------------

· the effect of any future governmental regulations on our products and business; 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· the continued growth of the global sexual wellness industry; and 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· our ability to respond to changes within the industry and consumer demand, financially and otherwise. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Government Regulation
 
We are subject to customs, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws.
Intellectual Property
 
The Liberator trademark is registered with the United States Patent and Trademark office and with the registries of many foreign countries. In addition, we were issued approximately 20 other product name trademarks and trade names including: “Bedroom Adventure Gear”®, Ramp®, Wedge®, Stage®, Esse®, Zeppelin®, Hipster®, Wing®, Equus®, Jaxx®, Avana®, and Bonbon®. In August 2005, we were issued utility patent number US 6,925,669 “Support Cushion and System of Cushions.” We believe our trademarks and patent have significant value and we intend to continue to vigorously protect them against infringement.
Employees and Labor Relations
 
As of September 21, 2019, we had 170 employees (135 in production and warehouse operations, and 35 in sales, marketing and administrative operations).  Additional staffing is typically required to support the peak holiday period through Valentine’s Day.  None of our employees are represented by a union. We have had no labor-related work stoppages, and we believe our relationships with our employees are good.
Seasonality
 
Our business is seasonal and, as a result, revenues will vary from quarter to quarter. During the past three years, we have realized an average of approximately 29% of our annual revenues in our second quarter, which includes Christmas, and an average of approximately 25% of our revenues in the third quarter, which includes Valentine’s Day.
Financial Information about Our Business Segments 
 
We conduct our business through two primary sales channels: Direct (consisting of our Internet websites and our Atlanta store) and Wholesale (consisting of our stocking reseller, drop-ship, contract manufacturing and distributor accounts). During our last two years, substantially all of our revenue was generated within North America, and all of our long-lived assets are located within the United States. The following is a summary of our revenues:

(Dollars in thousands) | Fiscal 2019 | | Fiscal 2018

Total Net Sales | $ | 17,003 | | $ | 16,426

Liberator - Liberator products consist of items that are manufactured by us and are intended for sale in the sexual health and wellness market. Liberator products are sold to retailers and distributors as well as directly through our three e-commerce sites and single retail store. Net sales of Liberator products increased 2% during the year ended June 30, 2019, from the comparable year earlier period. This increase is primarily related to higher sales to e-merchant as consumers increasingly purchase through online merchants.
Jaxx - Jaxx products are contemporary seating products manufactured by us and sold under the Jaxx brand. Jaxx products are sold to e-merchants and retailers as well as directly through our e-commerce site. Net sales of Jaxx products increased 8% during the year ended June 30, 2019, compared to the prior year. This increase is primarily due to greater sales of Jaxx products to (and through) Amazon and other e-merchants and an expanded product offering of outdoor and solid foam furniture products.
Avana - The Avana product line is a unique collection of comfort products that aid in sleep, meditation, and massage. Avana products are sold through e-merchants, mail order catalogers and through our e-commerce site.

Products purchased for resale – Products purchased for resale are other branded products that we purchase from others at wholesale or distributor prices and resell through our sales channels to retailers, or through one of our e-commerce sites and single retail store. Sales of these products decreased 31% during the year ended June 30, 2019 from the prior year. Sales of these products on-line is increasingly competitive and, as a result, the Company has elected to only offer a more curated selection of products that typically have a higher gross profit.
 
Other - Other products include sales from contract manufacturing and fulfillment services. Net sales during the year ended June 30, 2019 increased 5% from the prior year.
