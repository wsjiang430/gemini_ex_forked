Item 1. Business
OUR COMPANY
General. Corporate Office Properties Trust (“COPT”) and subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) is a fully-integrated and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”). Corporate Office Properties, L.P. (“COPLP”) and subsidiaries (collectively, the “Operating Partnership”) is the entity through which COPT, the sole general partner of COPLP, conducts almost all of its operations and owns almost all of its assets. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, “we”, “us” and “our” as used herein refer to each of the Company and the Operating Partnership. We own, manage, lease, develop and selectively acquire office and data center properties. The majority of our portfolio is in locations that support the United States Government and its contractors, most of whom are engaged in national security, defense and information technology (“IT”) related activities servicing what we believe are growing, durable, priority missions (“Defense/IT Locations”). We also own a portfolio of office properties located in select urban/urban-like submarkets in the Greater Washington, DC/Baltimore region with durable Class-A office fundamentals and characteristics (“Regional Office”). As of December 31, 2018, our properties included the following:

• | 163 properties totaling 18.1 million square feet comprised of 15.1 million square feet in 145 office properties and 3.0 million square feet in 18 single-tenant data center shell properties (“data center shells”). We owned six of these data center shells through an unconsolidated real estate joint venture; 


• | a wholesale data center with a critical load of 19.25 megawatts;


• | ten properties under construction or redevelopment (six office properties and four data center shells) that we estimate will total approximately 1.3 million square feet upon completion, including two partially-operational properties; and


• | approximately 900 acres of land controlled for future development that we believe could be developed into approximately 11.7 million square feet and 150 acres of other land.

COPLP owns real estate directly and through subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies (“LLCs”).  In addition to owning real estate, COPLP also owns subsidiaries that provide real estate services such as property management and construction and development services primarily for our properties but also for third parties. Some of these services are performed by a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”).
Equity interests in COPLP are in the form of common and preferred units. As of December 31, 2018, COPT owned 98.8% of the outstanding COPLP common units (“common units”); the remaining common units and all of the outstanding COPLP preferred units (“preferred units”) were owned by third parties. Common units not owned by COPT carry certain redemption rights. The number of common units owned by COPT is equivalent to the number of outstanding common shares of beneficial interest (“common shares”) of COPT, and the entitlement of all common units to quarterly distributions and payments in liquidation is substantially the same as those of COPT common shareholders. Similarly, in the case of any series of preferred units held by COPT, there would be a series of preferred shares of beneficial interest (“preferred shares”) in COPT that is equivalent in number and carries substantially the same terms as such series of COPLP preferred units. COPT’s common shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “OFC”.
Because COPLP is managed by COPT, and COPT conducts substantially all of its operations through COPLP, we refer to COPT’s executive officers as COPLP’s executive officers; similarly, although COPLP does not have a board of trustees, we refer to COPT’s Board of Trustees as COPLP’s Board of Trustees.
We believe that COPT is organized and has operated in a manner that satisfies the requirements for taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and we intend to continue to operate COPT in such a manner. If COPT continues to qualify for taxation as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to Federal income tax on its taxable income (other than that of its TRS entities) that is distributed to its shareholders. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its annual taxable income.

Business and Growth Strategies
Our primary goal is to create value and deliver attractive and competitive total returns to our shareholders. This section sets forth key components of our business and growth strategies that we have in place to support this goal.
Defense/IT Locations Strategy: We specialize in serving the unique requirements of tenants of our Defense/IT Locations properties. These properties are primarily occupied by United States Government and contractor tenants engaged in what we believe are high priority security, defense and IT missions. These tenants’ missions pertain more to knowledge-based activities (i.e., cyber security, research and development and other highly technical defense and security areas) than to force structure (i.e., troops) and weapon system mass production. Our office and data center shell portfolio is significantly concentrated in Defense/IT Locations, which as of December 31, 2018 accounted for 154 of the portfolio’s 163 properties, or 87.9% of its annualized rental revenue, and we control developable land to accommodate future growth. These properties generally have higher tenant renewal rates than is typical in commercial office space due in large part to: the importance of their proximity to defense installations or other key demand drivers; the ability of many of these properties to meet Anti-Terrorism Force Protection (“ATFP”) requirements; and significant investments often made by tenants in their space for unique needs such as Secure Compartmented Information Facility (“SCIF”), critical power supply and operational redundancy. 
Data center shells, which are properties leased to tenants to be operated as data centers in which the tenants fund the costs for the critical power, fiber connectivity and data center infrastructure, have been a significant growth driver for our Defense/IT Locations in recent years. From 2013 through 2018, we placed into service 17 data center shells totaling 2.8 million square feet, and we had an additional four under construction totaling 731,000 square feet as of December 31, 2018. We enter into long-term leases for these properties prior to commencing construction, with triple-net structures and multiple extension options and rent escalators to provide future growth. Additionally, our tenants fund the costs to fully power and equip these properties, significantly enhancing these properties’ values and creating high barriers to exit for such tenants.
We believe that our properties and team collectively complement our Defense/IT Locations strategy due to our:

• | properties’ proximity to defense installations and other knowledge-based government demand drivers. Such proximity is generally preferred and often required for our tenants to execute their missions. Specifically, our: 


• | office properties are proximate to such mission-critical facilities as Fort George G. Meade (which houses 119 organizations, including U.S. Cyber Command, Defense Information Systems Agency and other Department of Defense organizations and agencies engaged in signals intelligence) and Redstone Arsenal (which houses priority missions, such as Army procurement, missile defense, space exploration and research, development, testing and evaluation of advanced weapons systems); and


• | data center shells are primarily in the Northern Virginia area, proximate to the MAE-East Corridor, which is a major Network Access Point in the United States for interconnecting traffic between Internet service providers;


• | well-established relationships with the United States Government and its contractors;


• | extensive experience in developing:


• | high quality, highly-efficient office properties;


• | secured, specialized space, with the ability to satisfy the United States Government’s unique needs (including SCIF and ATFP requirements); and


• | data center shells to customer specifications within very condensed timeframes to accommodate time-sensitive tenant demand; and


• | depth of knowledge, specialized skills and credentialed personnel in operating highly-specialized properties with high security-oriented requirements.

Regional Office Strategy: While Defense/IT Locations are our primary focus, we focus secondarily on owning office properties located in select urban/urban-like submarkets in the Greater Washington, DC/Baltimore region due to our strong market knowledge in that region. We typically target submarkets with the following characteristics: (1) mixed-use, lifestyle oriented locations with a robust high-end residential and retail base; (2) proximity to public transportation and major transportation routes; (3) an educated workforce; (4) a diverse and growing employment base; and (5) constraints in supply of 
7

office space. We believe that these types of submarkets provide better overall quality and opportunity for long-term, sustained growth than other commercial office submarkets. As of December 31, 2018, we owned seven Regional Office properties, representing 11.5% of our office and data center shell portfolio’s annualized rental revenue; these properties were comprised of: three high-rise Baltimore City properties proximate to the city’s waterfront; and four Northern Virginia properties proximate to existing or future Washington Metropolitan Area Metrorail stations and major interstates. In prior reporting periods, this segment also included other suburban properties not meeting these characteristics that were since disposed.
Asset Management Strategy: We aggressively manage our portfolio to maximize the value and operating performance of each property through: (1) proactive property management and leasing; (2) renewing tenant leases at increased rental rates where market conditions permit; (3) leasing vacant space; (4) achievement of operating efficiencies by increasing economies of scale and, where possible, aggregating vendor contracts to achieve volume pricing discounts; and (5) redevelopment when we believe property conditions and market demand warrant. In 2017, we completed seven years of programmatic property sales to improve the strategic focus of our portfolio and improve our balance sheet and overall capital position. In the future, we plan to continuously evaluate our portfolio and consider dispositions when properties no longer meet our strategic objectives, or when capital markets and the circumstances pertaining to such holdings otherwise warrant, in order to maximize our return on invested capital or support our property development and capital strategy. 
We also aim to sustainably develop and operate our portfolio to create healthier work environments and reduce consumption of resources by: (1) constructing new buildings designed to use resources with a high level of efficiency and low impact on human health and the environment during their life cycles through our participation in the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) program; (2) investing in energy systems and other equipment that reduce energy consumption and operating costs; (3) adopting select LEED for Building Operations and Maintenance (“LEED O+M: Existing Buildings”) prerequisites for much of our portfolio, including guidelines pertaining to cleaning and recycling practices and energy reduction; and (4) participating in the annual GRESB (or Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark) survey, which is widely recognized for measuring the environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) performance of real estate companies and funds. We earned an overall score of “Green Star” on the GRESB survey in each of the last four years, representing the highest quadrant of achievement on the survey.
Property Development and Acquisition Strategy: We grow our operating portfolio primarily through property development opportunities in support of our Defense/IT Locations strategy, and we have significant land holdings that we believe can support that growth and also act as a barrier against competitive supply. We pursue development activities as market conditions and leasing opportunities support favorable risk-adjusted returns on investment, and therefore typically prefer properties to be significantly leased prior to commencing construction. To a lesser extent, we may also pursue growth through acquisitions, seeking to execute such transactions at attractive yields and below replacement cost. 
Capital Strategy: Our capital strategy is aimed at maintaining access to capital in the face of differing market conditions in the most cost-effective manner by:

• | maintaining an investment grade rating to enable us to use debt comprised of unsecured, primarily fixed-rate debt (including the effect of interest rate swaps) from public markets and banks;


• | using secured nonrecourse debt from institutional lenders and banks;


• | managing our debt by monitoring, among other things: (1) the relationship of certain measures of earnings to our debt level and to certain capital costs; (2) the timing of debt maturities to ensure that maturities in any one year do not exceed levels that we believe we can refinance; (3) the relationship of our variable-rate debt to our total debt; and (4) our total and secured debt levels relative to our overall capital structure;


• | using equity raised through issuances of common shares in COPT and common units in COPLP, joint venture structures for certain investments and, to a lesser extent, issuances of preferred shares in COPT and preferred units in COPLP;


• | monitoring capacity available under revolving credit facilities and equity offering programs to provide liquidity to fund investment activities;


• | paying dividends at a level that is at least sufficient for us to maintain our REIT status;


• | recycling proceeds from sales of interests in properties under our asset management strategy (discussed above) to fund our investment activities and/or reduce overall debt; and


• | continuously evaluating the ability of our capital resources to accommodate our plans for future growth.

Industry Segments
As of December 31, 2018, our operations included the following reportable segments: Defense/IT Locations; Regional Office; Wholesale Data Center; and Other. Our Defense/IT Locations segment included the following sub-segments: 

• | Fort George G. Meade and the Baltimore/Washington Corridor (referred to herein as “Fort Meade/BW Corridor”);


• | Northern Virginia Defense/IT Locations;


• | Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas;


• | locations serving the U.S. Navy (referred to herein as “Navy Support Locations”). Properties in this sub-segment as of December 31, 2018 were proximate to the Washington Navy Yard, the Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland and the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division in Virginia; 


• | Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama; and


• | data center shells, primarily in Northern Virginia (including six owned through an unconsolidated real estate joint venture).

As of December 31, 2018, Defense/IT Locations comprised 154 of our office and data center shell portfolio’s properties, representing 88.0% of its square feet in operations, while Regional Office comprised seven of the portfolio’s properties, or 11.1% of its square feet in operations. Our Wholesale Data Center segment is comprised of one property in Manassas, Virginia. 
For information relating to our segments, refer to Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements, which is included in a separate section at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K beginning on page F-1.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 378 employees, none of whom were parties to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Competition
The commercial real estate market is highly competitive. Numerous commercial landlords compete with us for tenants. Some of the properties competing with ours may be newer or in more desirable locations, or the competing properties’ owners may be willing to accept lower rents. We also compete with our own tenants, many of whom have the right to sublease their space. The competitive environment for leasing is affected considerably by a number of factors including, among other things, changes in economic conditions and supply of and demand for space. These factors may make it difficult for us to lease existing vacant space and space associated with future lease expirations at rental rates that are sufficient to produce acceptable operating cash flows. 
We occasionally compete for the acquisition of land and commercial properties with many entities, including other publicly-traded commercial office REITs. Competitors for such acquisitions may have substantially greater financial resources than ours. In addition, our competitors may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments or may be willing to incur higher leverage.
We also compete with many entities, including other publicly-traded commercial office REITs, for capital. This competition could adversely affect our ability to raise capital we may need to fulfill our capital strategy.
In addition, we compete with many entities for talent. If there is an increase in the costs for us to retain employees or if we otherwise fail to attract and retain such employees, our business and operating results could be adversely effected.
