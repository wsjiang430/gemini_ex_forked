Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
Trinity Place Holdings Inc. (“Trinity,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a real estate holding, investment and asset management company. Our largest asset is currently a property located at 77 Greenwich Street in Lower Manhattan (“77 Greenwich”). 77 Greenwich was a vacant building that was demolished and is under development as a mixed-use project consisting of a residential condominium tower, retail space and a New York City elementary school. We also own a newly built 105-unit, 12-story apartment building located in Brooklyn, New York (“237 11th”), acquired in May 2018, and, through a joint venture, a 50% interest in a newly constructed 95-unit multi-family property, known as The Berkley, also located in Brooklyn, New York, as well as a retail strip center located in West Palm Beach, Florida, and a property occupied by a retail tenant in Paramus, New Jersey. See Item 2. Properties for a more detailed description of our properties. In addition to our real estate portfolio, we also control a variety of intellectual property assets focused on the consumer sector, a legacy of our predecessor, Syms Corp. (“Syms”). We also had approximately $222.0 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) at December 31, 2018, which can be used to reduce our future taxable income.
 
We continue to evaluate new investment opportunities.  We have recently been focused on newly constructed multi-family properties in New York City, and continue to consider investment opportunities involving other types of properties and real estate related assets, in addition to repurchases of our common stock, taking into account our cash position, restricted cash, liquidity requirements under our loan agreements, and our ability to raise capital to finance our growth.  In addition, we may selectively consider potential acquisition, joint venture and disposition opportunities.

Business and Growth Strategies
 
Our primary business objective is to maximize the risk adjusted return on investment in our portfolio properties and new acquisitions and investments across all points of the economic cycle. Our strategies to achieve this objective include the following:

· | Legacy Properties. Continue the development of 77 Greenwich and the redevelopment, repositioning and potential disposition of our legacy retail properties in West Palm Beach, Florida, and Paramus, New Jersey;

· | New Acquisitions and Investments. Identify additional acquisition and investment opportunities, including high-quality, multi-family real estate in New York City and other select submarkets, that is designed to meet the demands of today’s tenants who desire newly constructed and efficiently designed apartment buildings located in close proximity to public transportation, and manage those facilities so as to become the landlord of choice for existing and prospective tenants. We may also identify retail and office properties that present opportunities for us to leverage our redevelopment and repositioning expertise. From time to time we may selectively consider opportunistic acquisitions of assets which increase our market share or provide access to new markets, which exhibit an opportunity to improve or preserve returns through repositioning through a combination of capital improvements and shift in marketing strategy, changes in management focus and leasing, as well as assets or interests in assets that offer strong long-term fundamentals, but which may be out of favor in the short term;

· | Joint Ventures. Explore joint venture opportunities with existing property owners in desirable locations, who seek to benefit from our depth of market knowledge and management expertise, and with strategic institutional partners, leveraging our skills as owners and operators; and

· | Capital Structure. Enhance our capital structure through our access to a variety of sources of capital and proactively manage our debt maturities.

Competition
 
The markets in which our properties are located are inherently competitive. With respect to our properties currently located in Paramus, New Jersey; West Palm Beach, Florida; Brooklyn, New York and with respect to any future real estate assets that we acquire or develop, we will be competing for some of the same tenants, contractors, lenders and potential purchasers or investors with respect to other properties within the same markets but owned by other investors, many of whom have greater resources that we do.
 
Competitive factors with respect to 77 Greenwich may have a more material effect on us as it is currently our most significant real estate asset. Various municipal entities are making and have indicated an intent to continue to make significant investments in the immediate vicinity of 77 Greenwich to support the growth of the downtown Manhattan neighborhood as a vibrant 24/7 community to work, live and visit. Several privately funded commercial and residential developments are being constructed or have been proposed to take advantage of the increasing desirability of the neighborhood. The impact of these changing supply and demand characteristics is uncertain, and they could positively or negatively impact our plan to maximize the value of 77 Greenwich.
 
In addition, we will face competition in identifying and completing new investment and acquisition opportunities, including from larger and more established real estate firms with greater capital resources and access to financing.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
Environmental Compliance
 
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances at a property, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator had knowledge of, or was responsible for, the release of the hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.

Other federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations require abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of demolition or certain renovations or remodeling, the cost of which may be substantial for certain redevelopment projects that a potential purchaser would want to undertake with respect to any particular parcel of real estate we own. Such laws, ordinances and regulations also govern emissions from and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. Federal and state laws also regulate the operation and removal of underground storage tanks. In connection with the ownership and management of certain properties, we could be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to these regulated substances or related claims.
 
Zoning and Planning
 
In connection with any development or redevelopment of our properties, whether currently owned or acquired in the future, we will be required to comply with applicable zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other laws and regulations. In many cases we are and will continue to be required to obtain governmental permits, site plan approvals and/or other authorizations, or seek variances, prior to proceeding with planned development, acquisition or other activities.
Chapter 11 Cases and Plan of Reorganization of Syms
 
Trinity is the successor to Syms, which also owned Filene’s Basement. In September 2012, the Syms Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”) became effective and Syms and its subsidiaries consummated their reorganization under Chapter 11 through a series of transactions and emerged from bankruptcy. As part of those transactions, reorganized Syms merged with and into Trinity, with Trinity as the surviving corporation and successor issuer pursuant to Rule 12g-3 under Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 
In March 2016, we satisfied our final payment and reserve obligations under the Plan.  In February 2018, the bankruptcy court entered the final decree pursuant to which the chapter 11 cases of the reorganized debtors were closed. As of December 31, 2018, the amount of remaining multiemployer pension plan claims to be paid was approximately $922,000, and there was an approximate $2.8 million of liabilities under the Syms sponsored pension plan (see Note 8 – Pension Plans to our consolidated financial statements for further information).
 
Intellectual Property Assets
 
We also control a variety of intellectual property assets focused on the consumer sector, a legacy of our predecessor, Syms, including our on-line marketplace at FilenesBasement.com, our rights to the Stanley Blacker® brand, as well as the intellectual property associated with the Running of the Brides® event and An Educated Consumer is Our Best Customer® slogan. In addition, various trademarks are controlled and/or owned by us, including “Filene’s Basement”®, “Stanley Blacker”®, “Running of the Brides”® and “An Educated Consumer is Our Best Customer,”® and have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had nine full-time employees in executive, management, finance, accounting, operations and administrative capacities.
