 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing human enzyme therapeutics to benefit people with rare metabolic diseases. Our vision is to redefine what was thought possible and pioneer bold science to deliver groundbreaking medicines to devastating rare diseases. Our two clinical programs are pegtarviliase for Homocystinuria and pegzilarginase for Arginase 1 Deficiency. Both clinical programs are focused on the underlying key metabolites that drive the clinical manifestations of these devastating rare metabolic diseases. We are on a mission to change lives by bringing innovative therapies to underserved rare disease communities.
 Pegtarviliase is currently being investigated for the treatment of Classical Homocystinuria. The drug is an investigational PEGylated, or polyethylene glycol modified, human enzyme engineered to reduce elevated levels of total homocysteine, or tHcy, circulating in the plasma. Homocystinuria is a rare genetic disease characterized by elevated plasma homocysteine levels, which can result in debilitating, often irreversible, neurologic, psychiatric, ocular and skeletal complications, and life-threatening vascular events. There are various etiologies leading to Homocystinuria and Classical Homocystinuria is specifically characterized by a deficiency in the cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) enzyme. Currently available treatments for Classical Homocystinuria are burdensome and have limited effectiveness in reducing tHcy for most patients, resulting in a significant unmet need for patients.
 Pegzilarginase is a recombinant human arginase 1 that is engineered to enzymatically degrade the amino acid arginine to reduce elevated levels of arginine in patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency. Arginase 1 Deficiency is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder with progressive, debilitating neurologic manifestations driven by persistently high arginine levels. There are currently no approved therapies that address the underlying driver of the disease, and most patients experience long-term clinical deterioration, including neuromuscular and cognitive decline, with current standard of care.
Our Strategy
 We believe there is significant potential to address rare metabolic diseases through human enzyme therapies and are committed to the development and commercialization of therapeutics that address unmet medical needs for these patient populations. Our strategy is to develop treatments for rare metabolic diseases where we believe there is a causal link between disease development and progression, and levels of key metabolites that drive the clinical manifestations of the diseases. For our two clinical programs, we have engineered and modified enzymes to have specific characteristics needed to address the underlying metabolic drivers of the diseases. For example, pegtarviliase was modified to have specificity for both the monomer and dimer forms of homocysteine and pegzilarginase was modified to have increased arginine-degrading activity. We selected therapeutic candidates for clinical development based on strong biological rationale and robust preclinical evidence to support a potential therapy that can transform patient outcomes.
Our primary focus is the advancement of pegtarviliase through clinical development, regulatory approval and into commercialization. We believe pegtarviliase has the potential to be a best-in-class enzyme therapy for the treatment of Classical Homocystinuria. Pegtarviliase is currently being studied in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to assess safety and efficacy in patients with Classical Homocystinuria, also known as Homocystinuria due to cystathionine β-synthase deficiency. We estimate that there are approximately 30,000 Classical Homocystinuria patients in global addressable markets, or the 38 countries with a combination of sufficient census data and other commercial elements (e.g., IP protection, access and reimbursement framework), and we estimate about 80% of these patients are unable to control their tHcy levels to targeted clinical thresholds with the currently available treatments. With significantly elevated homocysteine levels, these patients are continuing to experience irreversible progression and remain at risk for catastrophic thromboembolic events resulting in death.
Our other clinical program is pegzilarginase for the treatment of Arginase 1 Deficiency. We reported positive topline data for pegzilarginase for our global pivotal PEACE (Pegzilarginase Effect on Arginase 1 Deficiency Clinical Endpoints) Phase 3 trial in December 2021 and are continuing to evaluate the safety of pegzilarginase in an open-label study for patients who participated in our previously completed trials. Based on the results from PEACE and a previous Phase 1/2 clinical trial, a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, was submitted to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, by Immedica Pharma AB, or Immedica, our commercial partner in Europe and several countries in the Middle East. We announced in August 2022 that the MAA was validated by the EMA and is currently under review. We submitted a Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for pegzilarginase and announced in June 2022 that we had received a Refuse to File, or RTF, letter from the FDA. The FDA requested additional data to support effectiveness, such as evidence showing that plasma arginine and metabolite reduction predicts clinical benefit in patients with ARG1-D or clinical data demonstrating a treatment effect on clinically meaningful outcomes. Previously the agency had
requested an additional randomized placebo-controlled trial of a duration longer than 24 weeks given that efficacy data based on effort-dependent clinical outcome assessments and related endpoints have a high potential for bias. The FDA also requested additional information relating to Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls, or CMC, in the RTF letter. Dialogue with the FDA regarding the pegzilarginase BLA is ongoing.
In addition to our clinical programs, we have leveraged enzyme engineering to create additional pipeline candidates for the treatment of Cystinuria and other undisclosed diseases. These programs represent innovative solutions for diseases that previously were not believed to be addressable with enzyme therapies. For example, Cystinuria is a rare genetic disease characterized by frequent and recurrent kidney stone formation due to increased amounts of cystine in the urine. We engineered and optimized AGLE-325 to reduce plasma cystine and cysteine levels and therefore reduce urine cystine concentrations as an approach to inhibit cystine crystal and kidney stone formation. We announced in January 2023 that we are halting work on our preclinical pipeline candidates, including AGLE-325 for Cystinuria and that we will evaluate potential strategic options for these programs in order to maximize value.
 In developing programs for diseases with substantial unmet medical need, we seek opportunities with meaningful commercial potential. We intend to maximize the commercial opportunity and value for each of our product candidates by pursuing regulatory approval in the United States and other select regions on our own or with commercial partners. We retain worldwide intellectual property rights for pegtarviliase and all other preclinical product candidates. We retain all intellectual property rights for pegzilarginase in the United States and other regions outside of our commercial partnership with Immedica in Europe and several countries in the Middle East.
Our Therapeutic Candidates
 
Pegtarviliase in Homocystinuria
 Overview: Pegtarviliase is a novel polyethylene glycol modified, or PEGylated, human enzyme engineered to reduce elevated levels of total homocysteine circulating in the plasma. We engineered pegtarviliase by directed mutagenesis of amino acids within the wild-type human cystathionine γ-lyase enzyme, or CGL. The resultant enzyme has high substrate specificity for both the monomer and dimer forms of homocysteine but not for the native substrate, cystathionine. We believe that by rapidly driving down levels of total homocysteine in the blood, which includes the monomer, dimer and protein-bound forms of homocysteine, it will pull homocysteine out of tissues and cells and into the blood through equilibration. Pegtarviliase in the blood can continue to metabolize total homocysteine to drive lower systemic levels. Classical Homocystinuria patients experience fewer disease complications and improved outcomes with lower total homocysteine levels.
Selection of Enzyme and Enzyme Characteristics: In normal homocysteine metabolism, the CBS enzyme acts intracellularly to combine serine with the monomer form of homocysteine to form cystathionine. The presence of serine is required for CBS activity. In Classical Homocystinuria patients, intracellular homocysteine accumulates and eventually leads to increased extracellular levels through equilibration. In the blood, we believe approximately 30% of total homocysteine exists in a dimer or disulfide form, known as homocystine, and approximately 1% in the monomer form. The remaining total homocysteine in the blood is believed to be protein bound.
There are four main mechanistic characteristics that we believe are important for pegtarviliase as a potential therapy for Classical Homocystinuria: the ability to metabolize monomer and dimer forms of homocysteine, lyase versus synthase mechanism, durable pharmacokinetic activity, and potential immunological advantages. CGL is the enzyme that metabolizes cystathionine into cysteine and through targeted mutagenesis of CGL in the development of pegtarviliase we changed the target substrate to homocysteine with the ability to degrade both the monomer and dimer forms. Additionally, pegtarviliase is a lyase enzyme and cleaves homocysteine into other naturally occurring metabolites that are further metabolized and cleared. This means that the serine that is required in the normal intracellular metabolism with CBS is not required when pegtarviliase metabolizes homocysteine in the blood. Pegtarviliase was also PEGylated to increase the stability and half-life in plasma. These pharmacokinetic characteristics could lead to a longer exposure and duration of action as well as potentially increase the time required between doses. We believe these characteristics of pegtarviliase will lead to a faster and more durable reduction of total homocysteine. Lastly, patients with Classical Homocystinuria very likely have normal CGL. Starting with the wild-type CGL enzyme as a scaffold for pegtarviliase may reduce any potential immunogenicity to pegtarviliase.
 Phase 1/2 Open-Label Study of Pegtarviliase in Patients with Classical Homocystinuria: We are currently conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Classical Homocystinuria to assess the safety and clinical activity of pegtarviliase. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pegtarviliase in participants with Classical Homocystinuria. As a secondary objective, the trial will also characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as measured as the magnitude of change in plasma tHcy, of pegtarviliase after multiple doses following intravenous and subcutaneous administration. In cohorts 1 through 3, we plan to enroll approximately 12 patients diagnosed
with Classical Homocystinuria, aged 12 years or older (18 or older in the U.S.) with plasma homocysteine levels of 50 µM or greater at screening, and with a history of tHcy greater than or equal to 80 µM. Patients will be dosed once weekly for four weeks, with three to four patients in each of the dosing cohorts.
In March 2022 and August 2022, we announced the completion of the first and second dose cohorts, respectively. The first cohort, 0.15 mg/kg delivered intravenously, included three patients. Pegtarviliase was well tolerated with no safety concerns and data from this cohort showed reductions in tHcy in all three patients. Patients in the second cohort and third cohorts received 0.45 mg/kg and1.35 mg/kg, respectively, via subcutaneous administration. In November 2022, we announced that two patients in the third cohort of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial had completed dosing and that enrollment was ongoing. The decision to enroll patients in cohorts 4 and 5 and the design of these cohorts (e.g., dose level, duration, etc.) will depend on the data gathered from cohorts 1 through 3.
 Regulatory: We have obtained Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA and EMA for pegtarviliase for the treatment of patients with Homocystinuria. In addition, the FDA granted Fast Track and Rare Pediatric Disease designations for pegtarviliase for the treatment of Homocystinuria. These designations do not necessarily lead to faster development or regulatory review of pegtarviliase, or increase the likelihood that it will receive marketing approval. The Rare Pediatric Disease designation by the FDA provides the potential to receive a Priority Review Voucher if a qualifying BLA for pegtarviliase is approved before October 1, 2026.
In October 2022, we received a letter from the FDA regarding our protocol amendment for the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of pegtarviliase for the treatment of Classical Homocystinuria. The protocol amendment, among other things, allowed the inclusion of adolescent patients at clinical trial sites in the United States. The FDA stated the protocol did not provide adequate justification and evidence to support the prospect of direct clinical benefit for pediatric patients and placed the trial on partial clinical hold for the enrollment of patients less than 18 years of age under this investigational new drug application, or IND, at this time. A local Australian ethics committee, responsible for two clinical trial sites, recently stated that it would like to align with the FDA and place a hold on the enrollment of pediatric participants at those sites. Neither site has pediatric patients currently enrolled and no pediatric patients are pending enrollment at those sites. Both sites can continue to enroll adult patients. We intend to address the feedback from the FDA and aim to satisfy the requirements for prospective benefit for future inclusion of pediatric patients under the IND, including in a potential pivotal trial as well as engaging with the local Australian ethics committee.
 We plan to engage with the FDA on next steps for the program, including the design of a potential pivotal trial, when sufficient data from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial are available.
 
Homocystinuria overview
 Homocystinuria is an inherited disorder of the methionine metabolism pathway, or transsulfuration pathway, that results in elevated homocysteine and its dimer, homocystine in plasma and urine. This leads to a broad range of serious consequences, such as lens dislocation, skeletal abnormalities, vascular complications and neurologic disorders, as well as the potential for sudden and early death.
There are multiple forms of Homocystinuria that are distinguished by their mutation as well as some manifestations. The most common form of the disease is Classical Homocystinuria, or CBS deficiency. There are over 160 genetic mutations identified that adversely impact CBS enzyme activity to a variable degree impacting the level of tHcy and the response to some treatments. The vast number of mutations that can lead to Classical Homocystinuria result in a clinically heterogenous disorder, with some patients experiencing a more severe form of the disease than others.
 The goal of treatment for Classical Homocystinuria is to maintain consistent plasma tHcy levels below the currently defined biochemical targets. Current disease management is lifelong and includes dietary protein (methionine) restriction with amino acid replacement either alone or with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), and betaine supplementation, which is generally insufficient to effectively control all but the mildest form of the disease. As is the case with other medical diets, adherence is challenging, and nutrient supplementation is often necessary to prevent deficiencies that arise from a lack of normal natural dietary protein intake. Other treatments include high doses of vitamin B6, a cofactor for the CBS enzyme, and betaine, a remethylation agent that converts homocysteine back into methionine. Although betaine is considered to be generally well tolerated, some patients dislike the taste and/or fishy odor and often large doses are required multiple times each day, both of which may lead to poor compliance. Additionally, a risk of hypermethioninemia and cerebral edema has been reported with the use of betaine. While no long-term prospective data exists, recent guidelines based on expert review recommend a target tHcy of less than 100 µM for those that are unresponsive to vitamin B6, although some physicians aim for even lower targets with a combination approach.
 Some Classical Homocystinuria patients respond to vitamin B6, resulting in decreases of homocysteine, and are considered B6-responsive. B6-responsive patients have a less severe form of the disease as they are able to keep their homocysteine levels below the clinical guideline of 50 µM with B6 treatment alone. However, many patients are unable to achieve target levels of tHcy through administration of vitamin B6 in addition to the standard of care. These patients are
considered B6-non-responsive or B6-partially-responsive. Because these patients are unable to maintain tHcy levels below the recommended guidelines, they are at higher risk of disease progression and serious complications, including death.
Due to the effect of different mutations leading to various levels of enzyme activity and response to treatment, some subjects have severe childhood-onset multisystem disease, while others may be undiagnosed into adulthood. While newborn screening is universally implemented in the U.S. (and widely available elsewhere), publications have shown that only approximately 50% of cases are detected due to technical limitations of the test. Patients can present with Homocystinuria in childhood with a significant event, such as thrombosis, ocular lens dislocation, severe myopia, skeletal fracture, and/or other manifestations such as developmental delay or cognitive impairment. In adulthood, the most common presentation is with a thrombotic event. Untreated, the disease results in higher mortality, with B6-non-responsive patients having a 23% mortality rate by the age of 30. Publications have shown that outcomes are better in patients with lower tHcy with fewer complications and improved intellectual function.
 Based on an internal analysis of published literature and other data sources, we estimate the prevalence of Classical Homocystinuria to be approximately 30,000 in global addressable markets, with approximately 80% of those patients being potential treatment candidates due to their inability to control tHcy levels with currently available treatments. Of the approximately 25,000 treatment candidates in global addressable markets, including B6-non-responsive and B6-partially-responsive patients, approximately 8,500 are estimated in the key commercial markets of the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. We believe the lack of effective interventions to directly address the consequences of Classical Homocystinuria support the need for a therapy to reduce the harmful effects of persistently raised tHcy. Elevated tHcy levels have been linked to severe morbidity and mortality, and therefore the primary goal of any therapy is to reduce homocysteine levels below clinically relevant levels.
 
Pegzilarginase in Arginase 1 Deficiency
 Overview: Pegzilarginase is a PEGylated, recombinant human arginase 1 that enzymatically degrades the amino acid arginine. We engineered pegzilarginase with modifications that enhance the stability and arginine-degrading activity of the enzyme in human plasma. For Arginase 1 Deficiency, which is a rare progressive disease characterized by high levels of arginine, we believe pegzilarginase may reduce the harmful effects caused by the accumulation of high levels of arginine and other arginine-derived metabolites. Current treatment guidelines focus on the reduction of arginine levels in order to slow disease progression.
 PEACE - Global Pivotal Phase 3 Study of Pegzilarginase in Patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency: We announced topline results from the double-blind placebo-controlled portion of our PEACE Phase 3 trial in December 2021. The trial is believed to be the first-ever investigative therapy that directly addresses the high arginine levels that are believed to be the key drivers of this devastating disease for patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency.
PEACE was a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the effects of treatment with pegzilarginase versus placebo over 24 weeks with a primary endpoint of statistically significant plasma arginine reduction from baseline. The primary endpoint assessed the effectiveness of pegzilarginase in lowering plasma arginine levels. Secondary endpoints included clinical outcome assessments focused primarily on measuring the impact on functional mobility, including the key secondary endpoints consisting of Gross Motor Function Measure Part E, or GMFM-E, and 2 Minute Walk Test, or 2MWT, in addition to safety and pharmacokinetics.
The pivotal trial enrolled 32 patients aged two years and older, who had plasma arginine levels greater than 250 µM and a baseline deficit in at least one clinical response assessment. Patients enrolled in the trial were randomized on a two-to-one basis to receive weekly infusions of pegzilarginase (0.1 mg/kg starting dose), or placebo for the double-blind treatment period. Dose adjustments during this period were allowed in order to optimize plasma arginine control. Patients remained on current disease management for the duration of the PEACE Phase 3 trial. Upon completion of the 24-week treatment period, patients were eligible to participate in a long-term extension study of pegzilarginase, with all 31 patients who completed the double-blind period continuing into the long-term extension study and switching to subcutaneous administration.
In December 2021, we announced the topline results for the PEACE Phase 3 trial. In April 2022 and August 2022, we presented data from our ongoing PEACE Phase 3 trial at the Society for Inherited Metabolic Disorders, or SIMD, and at the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism, or SSIEM, respectively. Highlights from the PEACE Phase 3 trial to date are summarized as follows:
 •Primary endpoint was achieved with a highly statistically significant 76.7% reduction in mean plasma arginine in pegzilarginase treated patients (p<0.0001) compared to the placebo arm. 
 •Normal plasma arginine levels (40-115 µM) were achieved in 90.5% of pegzilarginase treated patients compared to no patients in the placebo arm. 

•Accompanying improvements in the key secondary mobility assessment endpoint in pegzilarginase treated patients compared to the placebo arm. 
 oGross Motor Function Measure Part E (GMFM-E): The least squares mean score improved by 4.2 units for pegzilarginase treated patients and worsened by 0.4 units in the placebo arm (p=0.1087), establishing a positive trend. 
 o2-minute walk test (2MWT): The least squares mean distance increased 7.4 meters in pegzilarginase treated patients and 1.9 meters in the placebo arm (p=0.5961).
 •Pegzilarginase was well-tolerated, and safety data were consistent with results from previous clinical trials. Serious adverse events included hyperammonemia and vomiting, which were infrequent, expected, and managed with standard treatment. There were no study discontinuations due to treatment-emergent adverse events.
 •In an analysis of individual patients that were Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) Level I-III with predefined clinical response criteria there were clinically important differences between the pegzilarginase treated patients (n=17) and the placebo arm (n=9).
 oEleven pegzilarginase treated patients (65%) reached or exceeded prespecified response criteria for at least one mobility assessment compared to four patients (44%) in the placebo arm.
 oEight pegzilarginase treated patients (47%) met or exceeded prespecified clinical response criteria for at least two of the mobility outcomes compared to no patients in the placebo arm.
 Phase 1/2 Open-Label Study of Pegzilarginase in Patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency: We completed a first-in-human Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency to assess the safety and clinical activity of pegzilarginase. The Phase 1/2, multi-center, single-arm, open-label trial of pegzilarginase enrolled 16 adult and pediatric patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency on background therapy in the United States, Canada, and Europe, exceeding the initial target of 10 patients. The Phase 1/2 dosing was completed in February 2019, with 14 patients completing 8 weeks of repeat dosing. The trial investigated both single ascending doses and repeated dosing. The primary endpoint of the trial was safety and tolerability of intravenous administration of pegzilarginase in patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency. The trial also evaluated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of repeated doses of pegzilarginase on plasma arginine levels. Additionally, patients who completed the repeat dose part of the Phase 1/2 trial were eligible to enroll in a long-term open-label extension study, with 14 out of 14 patients who completed the Phase 1/2 trial enrolling into the extension study. One patient later discontinued for non-study related reasons.
Phase 2 Open-Label Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Safety, Tolerability and Effects of Pegzilarginase in Patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency Who Received Treatment in a Previous Study: After completing the repeat dose portion of the Phase 1/2 study and at least three weeks of post-treatment observation, patients were allowed to continue treatment with pegzilarginase, including subcutaneous administration, by enrolling in a long-term open-label extension study. All 14 eligible patients enrolled in the Phase 2 open-label extension trial and all ongoing patients switched to subcutaneously dosed pegzilarginase when permitted.
We announced 20-week and 56-week data on 14 and 13 patients, respectively, from our completed Phase 1/2 trial and ongoing Phase 2 open-label extension trial for pegzilarginase in patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency. In each of the interim data announcements, we reported all patients continued to demonstrate marked and sustained reductions in plasma arginine following 20-weeks and 56-weeks of pegzilarginase administration and 79% (11 of 14) and 85% (11 of 13) of patients were clinical responders, respectively, based on a clinically meaningful improvement in one or more of three complementary mobility assessments. For GMFM-E, the mean change from baseline at the 56-week analyses was 6 units. When analyzing the subset of patients who had a baseline deficit (seven patients), the mean change for GMFM-E was 9 units. For the 6 Minute Walk Test, or 6MWT, the mean change from baseline at the 56-week analyses was 45 meters. Pegzilarginase was well tolerated and the rates of treatment-related adverse events decreased over time. Serious adverse events included hypersensitivity and hyperammonemia, which were infrequent, expected, and managed with standard treatment and did not lead to any patient discontinuations.
 Additionally, we announced 104-week mobility data from our completed Phase 1/2 trial and ongoing Phase 2 open-label extension trial on the nine patients that had completed assessments through the period. The mean change from baseline for GMFM-E and the 6MWT was 7 units and 38 meters, respectively, at the 104-week analyses. The clinical outcome assessment represented continued improvements over baseline after two years on treatment with pegzilarginase in the context of a progressive disease.
Regulatory: In August 2022, we announced that the EMA had validated the MAA, for pegzilarginase for the treatment of Arginase 1 Deficiency that was submitted by Immedica our commercialization partner in Europe and several countries in
the Middle East. Review of the MAA is underway, and a decision from the EMA with respect to approval of pegzilarginase may occur in late 2023.
 In April 2022, we announced that after careful consideration and further review of the efficacy and safety data from the ongoing PEACE Phase 3 trial, including the updated efficacy data from that trial and long-term safety data from the pegzilarginase program, we submitted a BLA to the FDA in order to provide all the study results for the FDA to review in detail.
 In June 2022, we announced that we received a RTF letter from the FDA for the BLA for pegzilarginase for the treatment of Arginase 1 Deficiency. In the RTF letter, the FDA requested additional data to support effectiveness, such as evidence showing that plasma arginine and metabolite reduction predicts clinical benefit in patients with ARG1-D or clinical data demonstrating a treatment effect on clinically meaningful outcomes. The FDA also requested additional information relating to Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls, or CMC. There were no issues related to safety raised in the letter. Upon receipt of the RTF letter, we had 30 days in which to request a Type A meeting with the FDA to clarify and respond to items identified in the RTF letter. The Type A meeting with the FDA was held in July 2022. We continue to engage in dialogue with the FDA to identify a viable regulatory approach and path to BLA resubmission.
 We have obtained Orphan Drug designation from the FDA and the EMA, as well as Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations from the FDA, for pegzilarginase for the treatment of patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency. In addition, the FDA granted a Rare Pediatric Disease designation for pegzilarginase for the treatment of Arginase 1 Deficiency. These designations do not necessarily lead to faster development or regulatory review of pegzilarginase, or increase the likelihood that it will receive marketing approval. The Rare Pediatric Disease designation by the FDA confirms our eligibility to receive a Rare Pediatric Disease priority review voucher if a qualifying BLA for pegzilarginase is approved before October 1, 2026.
 Licensing: We licensed to Immedica the rights to the commercialization of pegzilarginase in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, Vatican City, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman. The license and supply agreement, or Immedica Agreement, we entered into with Immedica includes a non-refundable upfront payment of $21.5 million from Immedica and development services provided to Immedica, up to $3.0 million. Under the terms of the Immedica Agreement, we are eligible to receive additional payments of up to approximately $120.8 million in regulatory and commercial milestone payments, assuming an exchange rate of $1.07 to €1.00. Additionally, we are entitled to receive royalties in the mid-20 percent range on net sales of the product in countries included in the Immedica Agreement. We will continue to be responsible for certain clinical development activities and the manufacturing of pegzilarginase and we retain commercialization rights in the United States and the rest of the world.
 
Arginase 1 Deficiency overview
 Arginase 1 Deficiency is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder with progressive, debilitating neurologic manifestations driven by persistent high arginine levels resulting from impaired arginase 1 activity. This leads to two important harmful metabolic effects: (1) the accumulation of high levels of arginine and other arginine derived metabolites, and (2) an impairment of the urea cycle which potentially leads to intermittent elevation of ammonia levels, especially at times of stress. The high plasma arginine level is believed to be the key driver of the spasticity, developmental delays, and seizures that develop in early childhood and progress over time. The impairment of the urea cycle also means that these patients are at risk of episodic and sometimes persistent hyperammonemia, which causes irritability, nausea, and vomiting with potential to progress to brain swelling, encephalopathy, reduced life expectancy, and death.
The current standard of care is inadequate to sufficiently lower arginine levels, and most patients experience continued progression, increasing morbidity, and early mortality. Current disease management practice includes a medical diet with protein restriction, ammonia scavengers, and adjustments to essential amino acids. Medical literature suggests that disease progression can be slowed with strict adherence to dietary protein restriction, which often includes the use of specially formulated supplements. Such dietary modification has been shown to partially reduce plasma arginine levels, but generally does not consistently reach the range stipulated by medical guidelines. Therefore, this disease management approach is generally inadequate to treat the majority of patients, unpalatable, and difficult to manage. Ammonia-scavenging drugs such as RAVICTI® (glycerol phenylbutyrate) and BUPHENYL® (sodium phenylbutyrate) are used to manage elevated ammonia levels. In some cases, liver transplantation has been utilized to treat Arginase 1 Deficiency; however, this intervention is available only to a small fraction of patients and carries significant procedural risk. There is a significant unmet need for treatment that effectively lowers arginine levels and prevents clinical deterioration in the long term.
 The lack of effective treatment options that directly address the cause of Arginase 1 Deficiency supports the need for a therapy that manages the harmful metabolic effects caused by accumulation of high levels of arginine and other arginine-derived metabolites (also referred to as guanidino compounds). We believe introducing an arginine-reducing therapeutic early in a patient’s life could potentially minimize the exposure to the neurotoxic effects of elevated arginine and its metabolites, as well as potentially enable increased protein intake. We believe that reduction and maintenance of plasma
arginine levels to within levels recommended by medical guidance for an extended period during the pegzilarginase dosing schedule has the potential to slow or halt the progression of the disease, thereby offering the potential for more normal growth and development in these patients.
 Arginase 1 Deficiency is a rare disorder, and disease prevalence has not been well established in the medical literature. Based on a published genetic prevalence analysis, we estimate that the Arginase 1 Deficiency population is greater than 2,500 patients in the global addressable markets and greater than 1,150 patients in the territories with regulatory and launch plans underway. The genetic prevalence-based methodology has the ability to account for misdiagnosis of the disease and to address limitations in newborn screening methodology, including naturally low arginine levels in newborns and lack of geographic availability or standardization of testing. Presently, only 34 U.S. states screen for Arginase 1 Deficiency, and screening in Europe is not universal. Because the manifestations of Arginase 1 Deficiency may overlap with other disorders such as hereditary spastic paraplegia, cerebral palsy or epilepsy, the prevalence of Arginase 1 Deficiency may be underestimated. We continue to make progress in patient identification, and insights from these efforts serve as a foundation for our potential commercialization strategy and execution.

AGLE-325 in Cystinuria and other research programs
 Cystinuria is a rare genetic disease characterized by frequent and recurrent kidney stone formation requiring multiple procedural interventions, and by an increased risk of chronic kidney disease. Cystinuria occurs due to genetic mutations in amino acid transporters that lead to increased amounts of cystine in the urine. This results in high cystine concentrations in the urine and formation of kidney stones. As such, we engineered and optimized AGLE-325 to reduce plasma cystine and cysteine levels with accompanying reductions in urine cystine concentrations as an approach to inhibit both cystine crystal and kidney stone formation. We presented preclinical data on a precursor molecule to AGLE-325 demonstrating reduced kidney stone formation in a preclinical model of Cystinuria.
In January 2023, we announced work on our preclinical pipeline candidates, including AGLE-325 for Cystinuria, would be halted and potential strategic options for these programs would be evaluated in order to maximize the value of those programs.

Patents may extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
 We aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach will provide us with proprietary positions for our product candidates, where available.
We also protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. In addition, we also require confidentiality or service agreements from third parties that receive our confidential information or materials.
 Licensing
 In December 2013, our wholly owned subsidiaries AECase, Inc. and AEMase, Inc. each entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement, including the right to grant sublicenses, with the University of Texas at Austin, or the University, for certain intellectual property owned by the University related to cystinase and methioninase. In January 2017, we and the University entered into an Amended and Restated Patent License Agreement, or the Restated License, which consolidated the two license agreements, revised certain obligations, and licensed additional patent applications and invention disclosures to the Company. The Restated License was amended in August 2017, December 2017, and December 2018 to revise diligence milestones and license additional patent applications, including the Company's program candidates under the pegtarviliase and Cystinuria programs.
 With respect to each program candidate covered by the Restated License, we could be required to pay the University up to $6.4 million in milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development milestones, including clinical trials and regulatory approvals, the majority of which are due upon the achievement of later development milestones, including a $5.0 million payment due on regulatory approval of a product and a $0.5 million payment payable on final regulatory approval of a product for a second indication. In addition, we are required to pay the University a low single digit royalty on worldwide-net sales of products covered under the Restated License, together with a revenue share on non-royalty consideration received from sublicensees. The rate of the revenue share ranges from 6.5% to 25%, depending on the date the sublicense agreement is signed. The term of the Restated License continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the patents licensed thereunder. The University may terminate the agreement under certain circumstances, including for a breach by us that is not cured within 30 or 60 days of notice (depending on the type of breach), or if we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees participate in any proceeding to challenge the licensed patent rights (unless, with respect to sublicensees, we terminate the applicable sublicense). As of December 31, 2022, we have paid $0.4 million under these license agreements.
 In March 2021, we entered into the Immedica Agreement, pursuant to which Immedica licensed the product rights for commercialization of pegzilarginase in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, Vatican City, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman. In April 2021, we received an upfront payment of $21.5 million from Immedica. Under the terms of the Immedica Agreement, we are also eligible to receive additional payments of up to approximately $120.8 million in regulatory and commercial milestone payments, assuming an exchange rate of $1.07 to €1.00. Additionally, we are entitled to receive royalties in the mid-20 percent range on the net sales of the product in countries included in the Immedica Agreement.
Grant Agreement
 In June 2015, we entered into a Cancer Research Grant Contract, or the Grant Contract, with the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, or CPRIT, under which CPRIT awarded us a grant not to exceed $19.8 million to be used to develop novel cancer treatments by exploiting the unique metabolism of cancer cells. The contract ended in May 2018 with the full $19.8 million in grant proceeds collected and recognized as revenue under the Grant Contract.
 Pursuant to the Grant Contract, we granted to CPRIT a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to any technology and intellectual property resulting from the grant-funded activities and any other intellectual property that is owned by us and necessary for the exploitation of the technology and intellectual property resulting from the grant-funded activities, or the Project Results, for and on behalf of CPRIT and other governmental entities and agencies of the State of Texas and private or independent institutions of higher education located in Texas for education, research and other non-commercial purposes only. The terms of the Grant Contract require that we pay tiered royalties in the low- to mid-single digit percentages on revenues from sales and licenses of products or services that are based upon, utilize, are developed from or materially incorporate Project Results. Such royalties are reduced to less than one percent after a mid-single-digit multiple of the grant funds have been repaid to CPRIT in royalties. Such royalties are payable for so long as we have marketing exclusivity or patents covering the applicable product or service (or 12 years from first commercial sale of such product or service in certain countries if there is no such exclusivity or patent protection).
 If we abandon patent applications or patents covering Project Results in certain major market countries, CPRIT can, at its own cost, take over the prosecution and maintenance of such patents and is granted a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, perpetual license with right to sublicense in such country to the applicable Project Results. We are required to use diligent and commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize at least one commercial product or service or otherwise bring to practical application the Project Results. If CPRIT notifies us of our failure with respect to the foregoing, and such failure is not owing to material safety concerns, then, at CPRIT’s option, the applicable Project Results would be transferred to CPRIT and CPRIT would be granted a non-exclusive license to any other intellectual property that is owned by us and necessary for the exploitation of the Project Results, and CPRIT, at its own cost, can commercialize products or services that are based upon, utilize, are developed from or materially incorporate Project Results. CPRIT’s option is subject to our ability to cure any failures identified by CPRIT within 60 days and a requirement to negotiate in good faith with us with respect to an alternative commercialization strategy for a period of 180 days.
 Competition
 While we believe that our expertise in enzyme science, bioengineering, and rare disease drug development provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and ultimately biosimilar and generic drug companies. Recent advances in gene-based medicine, such as gene therapy have resulted in market approvals of DNA and RNA-based therapeutics in certain rare genetic diseases. However, no gene therapy drugs have demonstrated clinical success in the type of complex diseases targeted by our research approach with novel enzyme therapeutics. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and a number of more established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products, may have competitive advantages as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product acquisitions. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash flows, and institutional experience.
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that address rare genetic diseases.
 With respect to pegtarviliase for Homocystinuria, there is currently one FDA-approved prescription therapy for the treatment of Homocystinuria and several medical foods for the dietary management of individuals with Homocystinuria. The primary treatment goal in patients with Homocystinuria is to maintain consistent plasma tHcy levels below the currently defined biochemical targets. Current disease management practice for the majority of Homocystinuria patients consists of dietary restriction, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folate supplementation, medical foods, and betaine. CYSTADANE® (betaine anhydrous for oral solution) was approved by the FDA in 1996 for the treatment of Homocystinuria, and Recordati Rare Diseases Inc. currently owns the North American marketing rights to this product. Medical foods are manufactured by Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc. and Upsher-Smith Laboratories, LLC.

We are also aware of a limited number of investigational therapies for the treatment of Homocystinuria. Travere Therapeutics Inc. is focused on the development of pegtibatinase, an enzyme replacement therapy in patients with Homocystinuria due to cystathionine β-synthase deficiency. Travere released topline data in December 2021 from its Phase 1/2 study of pegtibatinase which showed a 55% reduction in homocysteine at the highest dose cohort (1.5mg/kg, 2x/week). In January 2023, Travere stated that enrollment had been completed in the final cohort of their ongoing Phase 1/2 study and that the company is preparing for the initiation of a pivotal Phase 3 trial in the second half of 2023. SYNB1353 from Synlogic Inc. is also in clinical development for the potential treatment of Homocystinuria. In January 2023, the company announced completion of a Phase 1 study with anticipated advancement into Phase 2 in 2023. This investigational agent is an oral synthetic biotic platform that consumes methionine, an essential amino acid and precursor of homocysteine, in the gastrointestinal tract. We are also aware of two investigational therapies in preclinical development. The first is CDX-6512, an oral methionine-gamma-lyase enzyme therapy from Codexis. Additionally, Erytech Pharma SA also has a product candidate for Homocystinuria in preclinical development. It is possible that competitors may produce, develop, and commercialize therapeutics, or utilize other approaches to treat Homocystinuria.
 With respect to pegzilarginase for Arginase 1 Deficiency, there are currently no effective treatment options or approved therapeutic agents that address the underlying cause of the disease and we are not aware of any other therapeutics that do so in clinical development. It is possible that competitors may produce, develop, and commercialize therapeutics, or utilize other approaches to treat Arginase 1 Deficiency. The current disease management practice for patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency includes one or more of the following: dietary protein restriction, essential amino acid supplementation, and ammonia scavengers. The dietary restrictions with amino acid supplementation are intended to reduce plasma arginine levels, while ammonia scavengers (such as Horizon Therapeutics’ RAVICTI® (glycerol phenylbutyrate), BUPHENYL® (sodium phenylbutyrate) and Acer Therapeutics' OLPRUVATM) are used to manage elevated ammonia levels in patients with urea cycle disorders. A small number of companies have an interest in the role of arginine depletion in other therapeutic areas, but we are not aware of any active preclinical or clinical development activities in Arginase 1 Deficiency. In the oncology field, Polaris Group has conducted numerous clinical trials of ADI-PEG 20, an enzyme derived from mycoplasma, and Athenex has conducted preclinical research with PT01, a PEGylated genetically modified human arginase enzyme, in numerous tumor models.
 Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, nonclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved medicines than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of assays or tests that are essential to identifying an appropriate patient population, which we refer to as diagnostics, in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of biosimilar competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Manufacturing
 We currently contract with third parties for the process development, manufacturing, and testing of our product candidates for nonclinical and clinical studies and intend to do so for future studies as well. We may qualify additional manufacturers to provide potential alternative sources for the drug substance and fill-and-finish services for pegtarviliase and pegzilarginase as the compounds progress through clinical development. We believe we have sufficient supplies of pegtarviliase for our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Classical Homocystinuria and of pegzilarginase for our open-label extension study for the treatment of patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency who have participated in one of our previous clinical trials.
The Diosynth Agreement
 In November 2018, we entered into a master services agreement, or the Diosynth Agreement, with Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies UK Limited, Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies Texas, LLC, and Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies U.S.A., Inc., collectively, Fujifilm. Under the Diosynth Agreement, Fujifilm provides research, development, testing and manufacturing services of certain of our products, which are or will be designated as programs pursuant to scope of work agreements. The fees for such services are or will be set out in each scope of work agreement. We may pay additional fees in consideration of certain research and development and technical consultancy services in relation to the procurement,
testing and management of consumables, subcontracted work (including delivery of material to and from such subcontractors), process-specific equipment (including installation and qualification thereof), modifications and special waste. Either party may terminate the Diosynth Agreement by giving six months written notice to the other party, provided there are no uncompleted programs existing at the date such notice is given, or upon material breach. We may also be required to pay Fujifilm cancellation fees in the event that we decide to terminate any scope of work prior to its completion, calculated as a percentage of the fees payable under the applicable scope of work agreement. Additionally, upon providing written notice, we may cancel certain stages or programs for convenience, and Fujifilm may terminate for certain unforeseen technical errors.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 FDA approval process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of new drug applications, or NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, via a BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
 Biological product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of some preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. Unless the FDA places the trial in the IND on clinical hold within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. A clinical hold is an order issued by FDA to the sponsor of an IND application to delay a proposed clinical trial or to suspend an ongoing trial pending the resolution of a potential deficiency in the IND. All or some of the investigations conducted under an IND may be placed on clinical hold. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.

The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimal dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the biologic. A single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient in rare instances where: (1) the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) the trial has a statistically significant finding in combination with other confirmatory evidence.
 In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee for each prescription product. These fees are typically increased annually. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be filed based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review or whether to issue a Refuse to File letter. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard review biologic products are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the BLA; most applications for priority review biologics are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the BLA. Priority review can be applied to a biologic that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe, pure, potent and effective in the intended indication.
 After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for
healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy.
 Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs.
 Fast Track designation and accelerated approval
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs or biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track biologic concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. In addition to other benefits such as the ability to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the BLA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug or biologic for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A biologic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing trials, will allow the FDA to withdraw the biologic from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. The FDA may also grant a full approval to a drug or biologic based on a surrogate endpoint when the surrogate biomarker is validated, allowing it to be used in place of a clinical outcome. Validated surrogate endpoints must undergo extensive testing in clinical trials to show they can be relied upon to predict clinical benefit, which is more rigorous than the testing needed to demonstrate that a surrogate endpoint is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit to support an accelerated approval.
 Breakthrough Therapy designation
 The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drug or biological products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a Breakthrough Therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the biologic candidate. The FDA must determine if the product qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. Additionally, the Breakthrough Therapy designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process, including considering any new drug or biologic approvals that later the unmet medical need.
Orphan Drug designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug designation to drug or biological products intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug designation, the generic identity of the biological product and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a biological product containing the same principal molecular structural features for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with Orphan Drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan Drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the same disease or condition, or the same biological product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA user fee.
 Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program
 Under the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, FDA may award a Priority Review Voucher to the sponsor of an approved marketing application for a product that treats or prevents a rare pediatric disease. The voucher entitles the sponsor to priority review of one subsequent marketing application.
 A voucher may be awarded only for an approved rare pediatric disease product application. A rare pediatric disease product application is an NDA or BLA for a product that treats or prevents a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years; in general, the disease must affect fewer than 200,000 such individuals in the U.S.; the NDA or BLA must be deemed eligible for priority review; the NDA or BLA must not seek approval for a different adult indication (i.e., for a different disease/condition); the product must not contain an active ingredient that has been previously approved by FDA; and the NDA or BLA must rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population such that the approved product can be adequately labeled for the pediatric population. Before NDA or BLA approval, FDA may designate a product in development as a product for a rare pediatric disease, but such designation is not required to receive a voucher.
 To receive a Priority Review Voucher, a sponsor must notify FDA, upon submission of the NDA or BLA, of its intent to request a voucher. If FDA determines that the NDA or BLA is a rare pediatric disease product application, and if the NDA or BLA is approved, FDA will award the sponsor of the NDA or BLA a voucher upon approval of the NDA or BLA. FDA may revoke a Priority Review Voucher if the product for which it was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within 365 days of the product’s approval.
 The Priority Review Voucher, which is transferable to another sponsor, may be submitted with a subsequent NDA or BLA and entitles the holder to priority review of the accompanying NDA or BLA. The sponsor submitting the Priority Review Voucher must notify FDA of its intent to submit the voucher with the NDA or BLA at least 90 days prior to submission of the NDA or BLA and must pay a priority review user fee in addition to any other required user fee. FDA must take action on an NDA or BLA under priority review within six months of receipt of the NDA or BLA.
 The Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program was reauthorized in the Creating Hope Reauthorization Act in December 2020, allowing a product that is designated as a product for a rare pediatric disease prior to October 1, 2024 to be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher upon approval of a qualifying NDA or BLA prior to October 1, 2026.
 Disclosure of clinical trial information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biological products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain
circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 Pediatric information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by statute or regulation, PREA generally does not apply to a drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted; however, PREA applies to BLAs for orphan-designated drugs if the drug is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that the FDA has determined is substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.
 Additional controls for biologics
 To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents and related process impurities, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
 After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
 Patent term restoration
 After approval, owners of relevant drug or biologic patents may apply for up to a five year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between IND application and NDA or BLA submission—and all of the review phase—the time between NDA or BLA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
 For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug or biologic for which an NDA or BLA has not been submitted.
 Biosimilars
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical trials, animal trials, and a clinical trial or trials, unless the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, waives a required element. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of
the reference biologic. The FDA has approved numerous biosimilar products, and in 2021 approved the first interchangeable product under the BPCIA. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation, which is still being evaluated by the FDA.
 A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) 18 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) 18 months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
 Post-approval requirements
 Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 FDA regulation of companion diagnostics
 If use of an in vitro diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug or biologic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. The FDA has generally required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain a pre-market approval, or PMA, for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of a cancer therapeutic involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Approval and clearance of a companion diagnostic also requires a high level of coordination between the drug or biologic manufacturer and device manufacturer, if different companies.
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to a substantial application fee, which is typically increased annually. In addition, PMAs must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic has adequate sensitivity and specificity, has adequate specimen and reagent stability, and produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application
is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, additional testing and/or restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also register their establishment(s), including payment of an annual establishment registration fee, and list their device(s) with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes, and the processes of the device specification developer and repackager/relabeler (if different from the manufacturer) and initial importer (if manufactured outside of the United States), are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA.
 Other U.S. healthcare laws and compliance requirements
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of HHS (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below).
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses.

HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians, physician assistants, certain advanced care nurses and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data are posted in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Coverage, pricing and reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors
may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Healthcare reform
 Healthcare reforms that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, could result in further reductions in coverage and levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, increases in rebates payable under U.S. government rebate programs and additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical product prices. On September 9, 2021, the Biden administration published a wide-ranging list of policy proposals, most of which would need to be carried out by Congress, to reduce drug prices and drug payment. This recently culminated in the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, in August 2022, which will, among other things, allow the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to negotiate the selling price of certain drugs and biologics that CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D, although only high-expenditure single-source drugs that have been approved for at least 7 years (11 years for biologics) can be selected by CMS for negotiation, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. The negotiated prices, which will first become effective in 2026, will be capped at a statutory ceiling price. Beginning in October 2023, the IRA will penalize drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D drugs at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in Affordable Care Act marketplaces through plan year 2025. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. The full economic impact of the IRA is unknown at this time. It is unclear to what extent additional statutory, regulatory, and administrative initiatives will be enacted and implemented.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.

Additional regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
 International government regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
