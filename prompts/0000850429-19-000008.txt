General
Intellectual Property. Tredegar considers patents, licenses and trademarks to be significant to PE Films. On December 31, 2018, PE Films held 273 patents (including 63 U.S. patents), licenses under patents owned by third parties, and 109 registered trademarks (including 8 U.S. registered trademarks). Flexible Packaging Films held 1 U.S. patent and 14 registered trademarks (including 2 U.S. registered trademarks). Aluminum Extrusions held no U.S. patents and 2 U.S. registered trademarks. On December 31, 2018, these patents had remaining terms in the range of 1 to 20 years. 
Research and Development. Tredegar’s spending for research and development (“R&D”) activities in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was primarily related to PE Films. PE Films has technical centers in Durham, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; and Terre Haute, Indiana. Flexible Packaging has a technical center in Bloomfield, New York. R&D spending by the Company was approximately $18.7 million, $18.3 million and $19.1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Backlog. Backlogs are not material to the operations in PE Films or Flexible Packaging Films. Overall backlog for continuing operations in Aluminum Extrusions was approximately $67.6 million at December 31, 2018 compared to approximately $46.2 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $21.4 million, or approximately 46%. Net sales for Aluminum Extrusions, which the Company believes is cyclical in nature, were $573.1 million in 2018, $466.8 million in 2017 and $360.1 million in 2016. 
Government Regulation. U.S. laws concerning the environment to which the Company’s domestic operations are or may be subject include, among others, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), regulations promulgated under these acts, and other federal, state or local laws or regulations governing environmental matters. Compliance with these laws is an important consideration because Tredegar uses hazardous materials in some of its operations, is a generator of hazardous waste, and wastewater from the Company’s operations is discharged to various types of wastewater management systems. Under CERCLA and other laws, Tredegar may be subject to financial exposure for costs associated with waste management and disposal, even if the Company fully complies with applicable environmental laws.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act relating to emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (“GHG”), including mandatory reporting and permitting requirements. Several of the Company’s manufacturing operations result in emissions of carbon dioxide or GHG and are subject to the current GHG regulations. The Company’s compliance with these regulations has yet to require significant expenditures. The cost of compliance with any future GHG legislation or regulations is not presently determinable, but Tredegar does not anticipate compliance to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows based on information currently available.
Tredegar is also subject to the governmental regulations in the countries where it conducts business.
At December 31, 2018, the Company believes that it was in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits in the U.S. and other countries where it conducts business. Environmental standards tend to become more stringent over time. In addition, consumer preferences, ongoing health, safety and environmental studies on plastics and resins and other related legislative initiatives may adversely affect Tredegar’s business. In order to maintain substantial compliance with such standards, the Company may be required to incur additional expenditures, the amounts and timing of which are not presently determinable but which could be significant, in constructing new facilities or in modifying existing facilities. Furthermore, failure to comply with current or future laws and regulations could subject Tredegar to substantial penalties, fines, costs and expenses.
Employees. Tredegar employed approximately 3,200 people at December 31, 2018.
