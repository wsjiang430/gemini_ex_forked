Item 1: Business
Overview
Sonos is one of the world's leading sound experience brands. As the inventor of multi-room wireless audio products, Sonos' innovation helps the world listen better by giving people access to the content they love and allowing them to control it however they choose. Known for delivering unparalleled sound experience, thoughtful design aesthetic, simplicity of use and an open platform, Sonos makes the breadth of audio content available to anyone.
Our sound system provides an immersive listening experience created by our thoughtfully designed speakers and components, our proprietary software platform and the ability to wirelessly stream the content our customers love from the services they prefer. We manage the complexity of delivering a seamless customer experience in a multi-user and open-platform environment. The Sonos sound system is easy to set up, use and expand to bring audio to any room in the home. Through our software platform, we frequently enhance features and services on our products, improving functionality and customer experience.
Sonos sits at the intersection of emerging consumer technology and entertainment trends. The proliferation of streaming services and the rapid adoption of voice assistants are significantly changing audio consumption habits and how consumers interact with the internet. As a leading sound system for consumers, content partners and developers, Sonos is capitalizing on the large market opportunity created by these dynamics.
We debuted the world’s first multi-room wireless sound system in 2005 and have since been a leading innovator in wireless home audio. Today, our products include wireless speakers, home theater speakers and components to address consumers’ evolving home audio needs. We launched our first voice-enabled wireless speaker, Sonos One, in October 2017 and our first voice-enabled home theater speaker, Sonos Beam, in July 2018. In September 2019, we introduced Sonos Move, our first battery-powered, WiFi and Bluetooth-enabled speaker for use both indoors and outdoors, marking our first step outside the home. In fiscal 2019, we launched our first significant product partnerships - architectural in-ceiling, in-wall and outdoor speakers in partnership with Sonance as well as a bookshelf speaker and table lamp speaker launched in partnership with IKEA.
In addition to new product launches, we frequently introduce new features across our platform, providing our customers with enhanced functionality, improved sound and an enriched user experience. We are committed to continuous technological innovation, as evidenced by our growing global patent portfolio. We believe our patents comprise the foundational intellectual property for wireless multi-room audio technology.
Our network of partners provides our customers with access to voice control, streaming music, internet radio, podcasts and audiobook content, enabling them to control and listen to an expansive range of audio entertainment. In fiscal 2019, many of our speaker products added Google Assistant functionality, marking the first time consumers are able to buy a single smart speaker and have a voice assistant choice in addition to Amazon Alexa. Our platform has attracted a broad range of approximately 100 streaming content providers, such as Apple Music, Pandora, Spotify and TuneIn. These partners find value in our independent platform and access to our millions of desirable and engaged customers.
As of September 28, 2019, we added nearly 1.7 million new households in approximately 9.1 million households globally and our customers registered nearly 26.1 million products. As of September 28, 2019, 62% of our 9.1 million households had registered more than one Sonos product, and our customers have typically purchased additional Sonos products over time. We also estimate that our customers listened to 7.7 billion hours of audio content using our products in fiscal 2019, which represents 29% growth from fiscal 2018. 
Our innovative products, seamless customer experience and expanding global footprint have driven 14 consecutive years of sustained revenue growth since our first product launch. We generate revenue from the sale of our wireless speakers, home theater speakers and component products, as new customers buy our products and existing customers continue to add products to their Sonos sound systems. In fiscal 2019, existing customers accounted for approximately 37% of new product registrations. We sell our products primarily through over 10,000 third-party physical retail stores, including custom installers of home audio

systems. We also sell through select e-commerce retailers and our website sonos.com. Our products are distributed in over 50 countries, with 50.0% of our revenue in fiscal 2019 generated outside the United States.
Our products
Our portfolio of products encourages customers to uniquely tailor their Sonos sound systems to best meet their sound and design preferences.

• | Wireless speakers. Our wireless speakers include Play:1, Play:5, Sonos One SL and our voice-enabled speakers Sonos One and Sonos Move. Sonos Move was introduced in September 2019 and is our first battery-powered, WiFi and Bluetooth-enabled, portable speaker with voice control built for use both indoors and outside of the home.


• | Home theater speakers. Our home theater products include Playbar, Playbase, Sub and Sonos Beam and are designed to play audio content from TV/video. Sonos Beam also includes voice control.


• | Components. Our Connect, Sonos Port, and Sonos Amp, as well as our architectural speakers recently released in connection with our Sonance partnership, allow customers to convert third-party wired speakers, stereo systems and home theater setups into our easy-to-use, wirelessly controlled streaming music system.


• | Other. Sonos and third-party accessories, such as Sonos Boost, speaker stands and wall mounts, allow our customers to integrate our products seamlessly into their homes. Our other products also include module units, which are comprised of hardware and embedded software that are integrated into final products that are manufactured and sold by our partners such as IKEA.

Our software
Our proprietary software is the foundation of the Sonos sound system and further differentiates our products from those of our competitors. Our software provides the following key benefits: 

• | Multi-room experience. Our system enables our speakers to work individually or together in synchronized playback groups, powered by wireless mesh network capabilities to route and play audio optimally.


• | Enhanced functionality. Our platform enables us to understand and enhance our customers’ listening and control experience, delivering feature updates and intelligent customization through software enhancements and cloud-based services.


• | Intuitive and flexible control. Our customers can control their experiences through the Sonos app, voice control or an expanding number of third-party apps and smart devices. As our customers navigate across different controllers, our technology synchronizes the control experience across the Sonos platform to deliver the music and entertainment experience they desire.


• | Advanced acoustics. We have made significant investments in our engineering team and audio technology, which have enabled us to create speakers that produce high-fidelity sound. For example, we invented technology to allow two of our speakers to pair wirelessly and create multi-channel sound, thereby enabling a much broader sound field. In addition, our Trueplay technology utilizes the microphones on an iOS device to analyze room attributes, speaker placement and other acoustic factors in order to improve sound quality.

Our partner ecosystem
We have built a platform that attracts partners to enable our customers to play the content they love from the services they prefer. Our partners span across content, control and third-party applications: 

• | Content. We partner with a broad range of content providers, such as streaming music services, internet radio stations and podcast services, allowing our customers to enjoy their audio content from whichever source they desire.


• | Control. We provide our customers with multiple options to control their home audio experiences, including voice control and direct control from within selected streaming music service apps. In fiscal 2019, many of our speaker products added

Google Assistant functionality, marking the first time consumers are able to buy a single smart speaker and have a voice assistant choice in addition to Amazon Alexa.

• | Third-party partnerships. We partner with third-party developers to build new applications and services on top of the Sonos platform, increasing customer engagement and creating new experiences for our customers. In fiscal 2019, we launched a partnership with Sonance for architectural in-ceiling, in-wall and outdoor speakers, as well as a bookshelf speaker and table lamp speaker in partnership with IKEA. The IKEA partnership represents an innovative way to bring the Sonos experience to new potential customers at a global scale. IKEA offers a differentiated footprint as a distribution partner, providing retail showroom environments and extensive global reach.

Our competitive strengths
We believe the following combination of capabilities and features of our business model distinguish us from our competitors and position us well to capitalize on our opportunities:

• | Leading sound system. We have developed and refined our sound system over the last 16 years. Our effort has resulted in significant consumer awareness and market share among home audio professionals. For example, a 2019 product study by CE Pro, a leading custom electronics publication of the top 100 custom integrator professionals, ranked Sonos as the leading brand in the wireless audio, soundbar and subwoofer categories. Our 88% share in the wireless audio category among these industry professionals significantly outpaces our competitors.


• | Proprietary Sonos app and software platform. We offer our customers a mobile app that controls the Sonos sound system and the entire listening experience. Customers can stream different audio content to speakers in different rooms or the same audio content synchronized throughout the entire home. Additionally, the Sonos app enables universal search, the ability to search for audio content across their streaming services and owned content to easily find, play or curate their favorite music.


• | Platform enables freedom of choice for consumers. Our broad and growing network of partners provides our customers with access to voice control, streaming music, internet radio, podcasts and audiobook content, enabling them to listen to the content they love from the services they prefer. Our platform attracts a broad set of content providers, including leading streaming music services and third-party developers.


• | Differentiated consumer experience creates engaged households. We deliver a differentiated customer experience to millions of households every day, cultivating a passionate and engaged customer base. Long-term engagement with our products and our ability to continuously improve the functionality of our existing products through software updates leads to attractive economics as customers add products to their Sonos sound systems.


• | Commitment to innovation drives continuous improvement. We have made significant investments in research and development for over 15 years and believe that we own the foundational intellectual property of wireless multi-room audio. We have significantly expanded the size of our patent portfolio in recent years. In 2017, the strength of our patent portfolio placed us 2nd in Electronics and 19th overall in IEEE’s Patent Power Report.


• | Sound system expansion drives attractive financial model. We generate significant revenue from customers purchasing additional products to expand their Sonos sound systems, which has contributed to 14 consecutive years of sustained revenue growth. Existing households represented approximately 37% of new product registrations in fiscal 2019. We believe this aspect of our financial model will continue to contribute to our ability to achieve sustained revenue growth over the long term.

Our growth strategies
Key elements of our growth strategy include:

• | Consistently introduce innovative products. To address our market opportunity, we have developed a long-term roadmap to deliver innovative products and software enhancements, and we intend to increase product introductions across multiple categories, including products designed for enjoyment in all the places and spaces that our customers listen to audio content, including outside of the home. Executing on our roadmap will position us to acquire new customers, increase sales to existing customers and improve the customer experience.


• | Invest in geographic expansion. Geographic expansion represents a growth opportunity in currently unserved countries. We intend to expand into new countries by employing country-specific marketing campaigns and distribution channels.


• | Build direct relationships with existing and prospective customers. We intend to continue to build direct relationships with current and prospective customers through sonos.com and the Sonos app to drive direct sales.


• | Expand partner ecosystem to enhance platform. We intend to deepen our relationships with our current partners and expand our partner ecosystem to provide our customers access to streaming music services, voice assistants, internet radio, podcasts and audiobook content. For example, we introduced voice control with Amazon’s Alexa technology in 2017, Apple’s Siri via Airplay 2 in 2018, and Google Assistant in 2019.


• | Increase brand awareness in existing geographic markets. We intend to increase our household penetration rates in our existing geographic markets by investing in brand awareness, expanding our product offerings and growing our partner ecosystem.

Research and development
Our research and development team develops new software and hardware products as well as improves and enhances our existing software and hardware products to address customer demands and emerging trends. Our team has worked on features and enhancements to the Sonos system including development and improvements to the Sonos app, product setup, Trueplay tuning and the universal search function. The products and software we develop require significant technological knowledge and expertise to develop at a competitive pace. We believe our research and development capabilities and our intellectual property differentiates us from our competitors. We intend to continue to significantly invest in research and development to bring new products and software to market and expand our platform and capabilities. 
Sales and marketing
We sell our products primarily through over 10,000 third-party physical retail stores, including custom installers of home audio systems, and our products are distributed in over 50 countries. The majority of our sales are transacted through traditional physical retailers, including on their websites. We also sell through online retailers such as Amazon, to custom installers who bundle our products with services that they sell to their customers and directly through our website sonos.com. We sell products internationally through distributors and through retailers. These retailers also sell products offered by our competitors. In fiscal 2019, Best Buy accounted for 16% of our revenue and the ALSO Group, our distributor in Germany, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, accounted for 10% of our revenue.
We invest in customer experience and customer relationship management to drive loyalty, word-of-mouth marketing and growth of our direct channels. Our marketing investments are focused on driving profitable growth through advertising, public relations and brand promotion activities, including digital, out-of-home, print, sponsorships, brand activations and channel marketing. We intend to continue to invest significant resources in our marketing and brand development efforts, including investing in capital expenditures on product displays to support our retail channel partners.
Manufacturing, logistics and fulfillment
We outsource the manufacturing of our speakers and components to contract manufacturers, using our design specifications. Our products are manufactured by contract manufacturers in China and we have recently begun to diversify our supply chain through the addition of contract manufacturing in Malaysia.
7

Our contracts with our contract manufacturers do not obligate them to supply products to us in any specific quantity, except as specified in our purchase orders that are aligned with forecasts based on terms and conditions of the contract. The vast majority of our products are shipped to our third-party warehouses which we then ship to our distributors, retailers and directly to our customers. Our third-party warehouses are located in the United States in California and Pennsylvania, as well as internationally in Australia, Canada and the Netherlands.
We use a small number of logistics providers for substantially all of our product delivery to both distributors and retailers. This approach allows us to reduce order fulfillment time, reduce shipping costs and improve inventory flexibility.
Competition
We compete against established, well-known sellers of speakers and sound systems such as Bang & Olufsen, Bose, Samsung (and its subsidiaries Harman International and JBL), Sony and Sound United (and its subsidiaries Denon and Polk), and against developers of voice-enabled speakers and other voice-enabled products such as Amazon, Apple and Google. In some cases, our competitors are also our partners in our product development and resale and distribution channels. Many of our competitors have significant market share, diversified product lines, well-established supply and distribution systems, strong worldwide brand recognition, loyal customer bases and significant financial, marketing, research, development and other resources.
The principal competitive factors in our market include:
•brand awareness and reputation;
•breadth of product offering;
•price;
•sound quality;
•multi-room and wireless capabilities;
•customer support;
•product quality and design;
•ease of setup and use; and
•network of technology and content partners.
We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of the factors described above.

Intellectual property
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements, licenses and intellectual property assignment agreements. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary information. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we therefore may be unable to protect our proprietary technology in certain jurisdictions.
We currently hold over one thousand issued patents, including design and utility patents, and are pursuing hundreds of patent applications throughout the world. Our patents expire at various times. Our patents and patent applications focus on technology for the ability to stream content wirelessly to multiple rooms in the home, as well as other experiences that are important to the Sonos platform. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and 
8

in certain locations outside the United States. To protect our brand, we file trademark registrations in some jurisdictions. In 2017, the strength of our patent portfolio placed us 2nd in Electronics and 19th overall in IEEE’s Patent Power Report. We also enter into licensing agreements with our third-party content partners to provide access to a broad range of content for our customers. 
While we believe that our active patents and patent applications are an important aspect of our business, we also rely heavily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.
Employees
As of September 28, 2019, we had 1,446 full-time employees. Of our full-time employees, 1,023 were in the United States and 423 were in our international locations. Other than our employees in France and the Netherlands, none of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
