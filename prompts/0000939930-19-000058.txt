Company Overview
At Pyxus, we believe everything we do is to transform people’s lives so that together we can grow a better world. Pyxus provides responsibly produced, independently verified, and traceable agricultural products, ingredients and services to businesses and customers. Headquartered in the Research Triangle Park region of North Carolina, we contract with growers across five continents to help them produce sustainable, compliant crops. 
Historically, Pyxus’ core business has been as a tobacco leaf merchant, purchasing, processing, packing, storing and shipping tobacco to manufacturers of cigarettes and other consumer tobacco products throughout the world. Through our predecessor companies, we have a long operating history in the leaf tobacco industry with some customer relationships beginning in the early 1900s. In an increasing number of markets, we also provide agronomy expertise for growing leaf tobacco. Our contracted tobacco grower base often produces a significant volume of non-tobacco crop utilizing the agronomic assistance that our team provides. Pyxus is working to find markets for these crops as part of our ongoing efforts to improve farmer livelihoods and the communities in which they live. 
We are committed to responsible crop production which supports economic viability for the grower, provides a safe working atmosphere for those involved in crop production and minimizes negative environmental impact. Our agronomists maintain frequent contact with growers prior to and during the growing and curing seasons to provide technical assistance to improve the quality and yield of the crop. Throughout the entire production process, from seed through processing and final shipment, our SENTRISM traceability system provides clear visibility into how products are produced throughout the supply chain, supporting product integrity. 
As we announced in February 2018, we began a transformation process designed to diversify the Company's products and services by leveraging our core strengths in agronomy and traceability. In general, our diversification focuses on products that are value-added, require some degree of processing and play well to our strengths as well as offering higher margin potential than our core tobacco leaf business. In addition to our existing 50% interest in Purilum, LLC ("Purilum"), a U.S. company that develops, produces, and sells consumable e-liquids to manufacturers and distributors of vapable products, on August 21, 2017, the Company completed a purchase of a 40% interest in Nicotine River, LLC ("Nicotine River"), a manufacturer, retailer and wholesale supplier of compounds used for e-liquid production. On April 2, 2018, we purchased a 51% interest in Humble Juice, LLC ("Humble Juice"), a manufacturer and distributor of e-liquids. On December 18, 2017, a subsidiary of the Company completed a purchase of a 40% interest in Criticality LLC ("Criticality"), a North Carolina-based industrial hemp company to engage in cannabidiol ("CBD") extraction and other applications for industrial hemp in accordance with a pilot program authorized under the federal Agriculture Act of 2014 and applicable North Carolina law. On January 25, 2018, a Canadian subsidiary of the Company acquired a 75% equity position in Canada’s Island Garden Inc. (“FIGR East”). FIGR East is fully licensed to produce and sell medicinal cannabis in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island. We acquired an additional 18% equity interest in FIGR East on March 22, 2019. FIGR East sells its products in Canada directly to patients and through distributors. In January 2018, FIGR East signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the province of Prince Edward Island to be one of three suppliers under the provincial Cannabis Board. On January 29, 2018, the same Canadian subsidiary of the Company acquired an 80% equity position in FIGR Norfolk, Inc. ("FIGR Norfolk"), formerly known as Goldleaf Pharm Inc., which is licensed to produce cannabis in the Canadian province of Ontario. 
To support these business lines, we have broad geographic processing capabilities, a diversified product offering, an established customer base for our core leaf tobacco business and a growing customer base for our new business lines. We intend to focus on the expansion of our consumer-driven agricultural products. Because certain of these diversification investments are accounted 
 3
for under the equity method and others were made only recently and involve early-stage businesses, our core leaf tobacco operations continued to account for almost all of our revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
Our consolidated operations are managed and reported in ten operating segments that are organized by product category and geographic area and aggregated into three reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Leaf - North America, Leaf - Other Regions, and Other Products and Services. The Other Products and Services segment includes Global Specialty Products ("GSP") - Cannabis, GSP - E-liquids, GSP - Hemp, GSP - Other, and Value-Added Agriculture Products. 
Because we do not have a controlling interest in Criticality, Purilum, and Nicotine River, their results are not consolidated in our financial results and we account for our respective interests in these businesses under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our interest in their financial results, along with our interests in the financial results of several unconsolidated joint ventures with leaf tobacco operations, are reflected as “Equity in net income (loss) of investee companies” in our Statement of Consolidated Operations.
Leaf Tobacco Operations
Our leaf tobacco revenues are primarily comprised of sales of processed leaf tobacco and fees charged for processing and related services to these manufacturers of tobacco products. Processing and other revenues are approximately 5% of our total revenues. Our leaf tobacco operations deal primarily in flue-cured, burley, and oriental tobaccos that are used in international brand cigarettes. Pyxus has developed an extensive international network through which we purchase, process, and sell tobacco and we hold a leading position in most tobacco growing regions in the world. 
Leaf tobacco merchants purchase, process, pack, store, and ship tobacco to manufacturers of cigarettes and other consumer tobacco products throughout the world. In an increasing number of markets, we also provide agronomy expertise for growing leaf tobacco. Our leaf tobacco revenues are primarily comprised of sales of processed tobacco and fees charged for processing and related services to these manufacturers of tobacco products. We do not manufacture cigarettes or other consumer tobacco products.
We purchase tobacco in more than 35 countries and ship to approximately 90 countries. Tobacco is primarily purchased directly from suppliers with small quantities still purchased at auction. We purchase tobacco directly from suppliers and we assume the risk of matching the quantities and grades required by our customers to the entire crop we must purchase under contract. In some markets, we buy tobacco from local entities that have purchased tobacco from suppliers and supervise the processing of that tobacco by those local entities. Auction markets and our network of tobacco operations and buyers allows us to cover the major auctions of flue-cured and burley tobacco throughout the world. A number of our customers purchase tobacco directly from the suppliers in addition to the leaf merchants. Although our facilities process the tobacco purchased directly from suppliers by these customers, we do not take ownership of that tobacco and do not record sales revenues associated with its resale. Our arrangements with suppliers vary from locale to locale depending on our predictions of future supply and demand, local historical practice and availability of capital. We purchase seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and other products related to growing tobacco, which we are contractually obligated to purchase. We advance these inputs to suppliers, which represents prepaid inventory. The advances of inputs for the current crop generally include the original cost of the inputs plus a mark-up and interest as it is earned. Where contractually permitted, we charge interest to the suppliers during the period the current crop advance is outstanding. We generally advance inputs at a price greater than our cost, which results in a mark-up on the inputs. We account for our advances to tobacco suppliers using a cost accumulation model, which results in us reporting our advances at the lower of cost or recoverable amounts excluding the mark-up and interest. The mark-up and interest on our advances are recognized when the tobacco is delivered as a decrease in our cost of the current crop. Upon delivery of tobacco, part of the purchase price paid to the supplier is paid in cash and part through a reduction of the advance balance. The advances applied to the delivery are reclassified out of advances and into unprocessed inventory. We advance inputs only to suppliers with whom we have purchase contracts. Under longer-term arrangements with suppliers, we may advance or guarantee financing on suppliers' capital assets, which are also recovered through the delivery of tobacco to us by our suppliers.
Our agronomists maintain frequent contact with suppliers prior to and during the growing and curing seasons to provide technical assistance to improve the quality and yield of the crop. As a result of various factors including weather, not all suppliers are able to settle the entire amount of advances through delivery of tobacco in a given crop year. Throughout the crop cycle, we monitor events that may impact the suppliers’ ability to deliver tobacco. If we determine we will not be able to recover the original cost of the advances with deliveries of the current crop, or future crop deliveries, the unit cost of tobacco actually received is increased when unrecoverable costs are within a normal range which is based on our historical results or expensed immediately when they are above a normal range based on our historical results. We account for the unrecoverable costs in this manner to ensure only costs within a normal range are capitalized in inventory and costs that are above a normal range are expensed immediately as current period charges.
During the three years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, approximately 17%, 25%, and 24%, respectively, of our purchases of leaf tobacco were from the Leaf - North America operating segment and approximately 83%, 75%, and 76%, respectively, were from the Leaf - Other Regions operating segment. Within the Leaf - Other Regions operating segment, approximately 67%, 61%, 
 4
and 60% of our total purchases for the three years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, were from China, Brazil, Turkey, and the Africa Region. We have entered into contracts, joint ventures and other arrangements for the purchase of tobacco grown in substantially all other countries that produce export-quality flue-cured and burley tobacco.
We process tobacco to meet each customer's specifications as to quality, yield, chemistry, particle size, moisture content and other characteristics. Unprocessed tobacco is a semi-perishable commodity. The processing of leaf tobacco facilitates shipping and prevents spoilage and is an essential service to our customers because the quality of processed leaf tobacco substantially affects the quality of the manufacturer’s end product. Accordingly, we have located our production facilities in proximity to our principal sources of tobacco.
We process tobacco in Company-owned and third-party facilities around the world, including Argentina, Brazil, China, Zimbabwe, Jordan, Guatemala, India, Tanzania, the United States, Malawi, Thailand, Indonesia, Macedonia, Kenya, and Turkey. These facilities encompass all leading export locations of flue-cured, burley and oriental tobaccos. In addition, we have entered into contracts, joint ventures and other arrangements for the purchase of tobacco grown in substantially all other countries that produce export-quality flue-cured and burley tobacco.
Upon arrival at our processing plants, flue-cured and burley tobacco is first reclassified according to grade. Tobacco is then blended to meet customer specifications regarding color, body and chemistry, threshed to remove the stem from the leaf and further processed to produce strips of tobacco and sieve out small scrap. We also sell a small amount of processed but unthreshed flue-cured and burley tobacco in loose-leaf and bundle form to certain customers. Tobacco is redried to remove excess moisture so that it can be held in storage by customers or us for long periods of time. After redrying, whole leaves, bundles, strips or stems and scrap where applicable are separately packed in cases, bales, cartons or hogsheads for storage and shipment. Packed tobacco generally is transported in the country of origin by truck or rail, and exports are moved by ship. Prior to and during processing, steps are taken to ensure consistent quality of the tobacco, including the regrading and removal of undesirable leaves, dirt and other non-tobacco related material. Customer representatives are frequently present at our facilities to monitor the processing of their particular orders. Throughout the processing, our technicians use quality control laboratory test equipment to ensure that the product meets all customer specifications.
Key Customers
In our leaf tobacco business, our primary customers are major consumer tobacco product manufacturers. The consumer tobacco business is dominated by a relatively small number of large multinational cigarette manufacturers and by government controlled entities. Including their respective affiliates, accounting for more than 10% of our revenues were each of Philip Morris International, Inc. ("PMI"), China Tobacco International, Inc. and Imperial Brands, PLC for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 and PMI and China Tobacco International, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2017. In the 2019 fiscal year, Pyxus delivered approximately 38% of its tobacco sales to customers in Europe and approximately 14% to customers in the United States. The remaining sales of leaf tobacco are to customers located in Asia, Africa, and other geographic regions of the world.
Competition
The Company is one of only two global, publicly held leaf tobacco merchants. We hold a leading position in most major tobacco growing regions in the world, including the principal export markets for flue-cured, burley and oriental tobacco and, as a result of our scale, global reach, and financial resources, we believe we are well-suited to serve the needs of all manufacturers of cigarettes and other consumer tobacco products. The leaf tobacco industry is highly competitive and competition is based primarily on the price charged for products and services as well as the merchant's ability to meet customer specifications in the buying, processing, residue compliance and financing of tobacco. In addition to the primary global independent leaf tobacco merchants, there are a number of other independent global, regional or national competitors. Local independent leaf merchants with low fixed costs and overhead also supply cigarette manufacturers. Recent vertical integration initiatives and other changes in customer buying patterns have resulted in a more dynamic and competitive operating environment. There is also competition in all countries to buy the available leaf tobacco and, in many areas, total leaf tobacco processing capacity exceeds demand.
Seasonality
The purchasing and processing activities of our leaf tobacco business are seasonal. Tobacco purchases vary by market and tobacco variety. Flue-cured tobacco grown in the United States is purchased, processed, and marketed generally during the five-month period beginning in July and ending in November. U.S. grown burley tobacco is purchased, processed, and marketed usually from late November through January or February. Tobacco grown in Brazil is usually purchased, processed, and marketed from January through July and in Africa from April through September.
Other tobacco markets around the world have similar purchasing periods, although at different times of the year. During the purchasing, processing and marketing seasons, inventories of unprocessed tobacco, inventories of redried tobacco and trade accounts receivable normally reach peak levels in succession. Current liabilities, particularly advances from customers and short-term notes payable to banks, normally reach their peak in this period as a means of financing the seasonal expansion of current 
 5
assets. At March 31, the end of our fiscal year, the seasonal components of our working capital reflect primarily the operations related to foreign-grown tobacco.
Research and Development
We routinely cooperate with both our customers and the manufacturers of the equipment used in our leaf processing facilities to improve processing technologies. However, no material amounts are expended for research and development, and we hold no material patents, franchises, or concessions.
Track and Trace Technology
In connection with its leaf tobacco operations, the Company uses a proprietary “track and trace” system, which we have branded as the SENTRISM platform, which we believe provides transparency into the lifecycle of agricultural products by monitoring information and obtaining data related to the growth, cultivation, harvest, processing, formulation, testing, and release of individual batches of products. By obtaining data on products at each stage of the supply chain, SENTRISM permits proactive decision-making for both the Company and its leaf tobacco customers. The key features of the SENTRISM platform include:

• | Product Tracking: Data collection and tracking at various stages in the product lifecycle permits customers and consumers to gain an understanding of where products originate from, how they were produced, and the product testing data in order to understand ingredients and the product journey.


• | Control and Visibility: With access to increased data regarding the supply chain, we are able to monitor quality control at various points in the product route to market.


• | Sustainability Commitments: SENTRISM incorporates visibility into the practices and procedures of the product supply chain.


• | Lot Number Tracking: We are able to track specific products through the manufacturing process by lot number with full visibility to our customers. This permits us and our customers to discover more about the product, its origin and other information relevant to quality control and product transparency.


• | Agronomic Services: SENTRISM utilizes an experienced team of agronomists to track data and insights regarding growing practices.

New Business Lines
The new business lines encompass both consolidated operations and investments that are accounted for under the equity method, and generally are early-stage businesses. It is our plan that, as these new businesses further develop and we pursue other diversification opportunities, these business lines will begin to meaningfully contribute to future years’ revenues with a more significant impact toward profitability.
Canadian Cannabis Businesses
On October 17, 2018, legislation in Canada legalizing recreational adult use of cannabis nationwide came into effect. We refer to this legislation as the “Canadian Cannabis Act.” Pursuant to the Canadian Cannabis Act, the production and sale of cannabis products for medical or adult recreational use is subject to licensing by Health Canada and by various provincial authorities. Currently applicable Canadian regulations permit the sale of only dried cannabis, cannabis oil, fresh cannabis, cannabis plants, and cannabis seeds, including in such forms as “pre-rolled” and capsule products. Pursuant to the Canadian Cannabis Act, certain classes of cannabis products, such as edibles, concentrates and other ingestibles are currently prohibited from sale, but it is contemplated under the Canadian Cannabis Act that such products will be permitted for sale in the future.
FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk operate cannabinoid businesses from their facilities in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, and Simcoe, Ontario, respectively. FIGR East is licensed to produce, package and label dried cannabis, fresh cannabis, cannabis seeds, cannabis plants and cannabis oil, and to sell such cannabis products for recreational and medical purposes within Canada in accordance with Canadian regulatory provisions. FIGR Norfolk is licensed to produce dried cannabis, fresh cannabis, cannabis plants and cannabis seeds, and to sell produced cannabis plants and cannabis seeds within Canada in accordance with Canadian regulatory provisions and to sell dried cannabis only in bulk transfers to other licensed producers. 
FIGR East
FIGR East currently offers a line of legal cannabinoid consumer products, branded “FIGR”, for sale to the medical and adult-use market, with premium product offerings of dried cannabis flowers, pre-rolls, and cannabis oils containing varying levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”), the psychoactive compound in cannabis, and CBD intended to appeal to a range of consumer segments. FIGR East has further segmented its consumer products into several product lines, which FIGR East believes offers differentiated benefits to appeal to a broader range of consumer segments and improve price realization. 
 6
FIGR East's existing 24,000 square feet production facility (the “FIGR East Facility”) is a purpose-built indoor cannabis production and hydroponic cultivation facility located on a portion of 13 acres of property owned by FIGR East. The square footage of the FIGR East Facility is allocated as follows:

• | Cultivation: 10,000 square feet


• | Other (vault, trim room, drying room, mechanical room, locker rooms): 12,000 square feet


• | Administrative/office space: 2,000 square feet

The FIGR East Facility’s current annual production capacity is capable of yielding approximately 1,300 kilograms (or approximately 2,800 pounds) of dried cannabis and dried cannabis equivalent products. Being purpose-built for cannabis growing, the FIGR East Facility’s average yield per harvest has improved from 31.35 kilograms (or 69.11 pounds) in 2017 to 50.21 kilograms (or 110.69 pounds) in 2018. FIGR East expects the capacity to further expand as it continues to improve yields through operational improvements. 
FIGR East has successfully grown three different varieties of cannabis, with varying levels of THC and CBD. With the contemplated expansion described below, FIGR East intends to grow new varieties of cannabis obtained from FIGR Norfolk to add to the breadth of its consumer product portfolio. 
FIGR East’s regulatory license permits it to produce cannabis oil with on-site extraction. The FIGR East Facility has an approximate 4,000 kilogram (or approximate 8,800 pound) maximum annual extraction capacity. FIGR East employs supercritical carbon dioxide extraction equipment at the FIGR East Facility. 
FIGR East tests its product for potency, microbiological, heavy metal, and pesticide contamination using third party labs, as well as internal testing processes. These data points are logged and made available to consumers through the SENTRISM platform. FIGR East currently has in-house quality control testing capabilities and employs quality assurance personnel with extensive training, experience, and technical knowledge to monitor the quality of FIGR East products.
A portion of FIGR East’s harvested crop is used for premium dried cannabis flowers and pre-roll consumer products, while additional portions of the harvested crop are processed to extract cannabinoid oils. These oils are currently bottled into oil consumer products, and, as regulations permit, can be further processed into additional consumer products, including vapable products. FIGR East packages and labels its current products, being premium dried cannabis flowers, pre-rolls, and cannabis oils, at the FIGR East Facility.
Once product has been processed and packaged, it is stored in a vault at the FIGR East Facility. The FIGR East Facility has a level 7 vault, which meets Health Canada’s mandated minimum security requirements for Canadian licensed cannabis producers. The FIGR East Facility’s level 7 vault contains various layers of security mechanisms to prevent unauthorized entry, exit and product access, as well as further mechanisms that ensure the safety of the product contained inside the vault. These features include locking mechanisms, smoke detectors, entrance triggers, proximity detectors, alarm systems, guarded ventilation and sufficiently reinforced vault surfaces. 
FIGR East is in the process of expanding to add an additional 252,628 square feet of hydroponic cultivation space through the construction of a purpose-built greenhouse on land owned by FIGR East adjacent to the FIGR East Facility (the “Charlottetown Expansion”). In addition, there is an existing 53,574 square foot processing warehouse. FIGR East expects the Charlottetown Expansion to be operational beginning in October 2019, subject to applicable regulatory approvals. The square footage of the Charlottetown Expansion is expected to be allocated as follows:

• | Phase 1 Greenhouse: 165,772 square feet


• | Phase 2 Greenhouse: 86,856 square feet

FIGR East expects that the Charlottetown Expansion will become operational in phases so as to provide incremental increases in cultivation capacity until the Charlottetown Expansion is fully operational. 
FIGR Norfolk
FIGR Norfolk’s existing facility (the “FIGR Norfolk Facility”) consists of approximately 16,000 square feet of indoor cultivation and processing space owned by FIGR Norfolk. FIGR Norfolk’s license does not currently permit sale to the medical or adult-use market or the extraction and sale of cannabis oil. The existing FIGR Norfolk Facility was previously a metal manufacturing facility. In November 2017, FIGR Norfolk began the process of retrofitting the FIGR Norfolk Facility for cannabis cultivation and processing 
 7
as well as to make the FIGR Norfolk Facility compliant with Health Canada requirements for licensing. The approximate square footage of the FIGR Norfolk Facility is allocated as follows:

• | Cultivation: 7,034 square feet


• | Processing area (packaging, extraction, drying, curing, vault): 9,282 square feet


• | Administrative/office space: 2,746 square feet

The FIGR Norfolk Facility’s current production capacity is capable of yielding approximately 1,100 kilograms (or approximately 2,400 pounds) of dried cannabis and dried cannabis equivalent products. FIGR Norfolk employs hydroponic cultivation methods at the FIGR Norfolk Facility. FIGR Norfolk recently applied for an amendment to Health Canada for its license to permit the production of cannabis oil.
FIGR Norfolk tests its products for potency, microbiological, heavy metal, and pesticide contamination using third party labs, as well as internal testing processes. Upon receiving a license enabling it to sell branded dried cannabis products for sale to consumers, FIGR Norfolk plans to log relevant production data to be made available to consumers through the SENTRISM platform. FIGR Norfolk currently has in-house quality control testing capabilities and employs quality assurance personnel with extensive training, experience, and technical knowledge to monitor the quality of FIGR Norfolk products.
FIGR Norfolk has successfully grown two different varieties of cannabis at the FIGR Norfolk Facility, with varying levels of THC and CBD.
Once product has been processed and packaged, it is stored in a vault at the FIGR Norfolk Facility. The FIGR Norfolk Facility has a level 9 vault, which exceeds Health Canada’s mandated minimum security requirements for Canadian licensed cannabis producers. The FIGR Norfolk Facility’s level 9 vault contains various layers of security mechanisms to prevent unauthorized entry, exit and product access, and further mechanisms that ensure the safety of the product contained inside the vault. Such mechanisms include, without limitation, all of the features implemented at the FIGR East Facility, as well as additional layers of security and/or mechanisms possessing a higher degree of sensitivity to events that they are designed to prevent and/or detect.
Upon receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, FIGR Norfolk anticipates that a portion of its harvested crop will be used for premium dried cannabis flowers and pre-roll consumer products, while additional portions of the harvested crop will be processed to extract cannabinoid oils. Upon receipt of an amendment to its license to permit sales, FIGR Norfolk expects to package and label its product offerings at the FIGR Norfolk Facility. 
FIGR Norfolk is planning to construct an additional purpose-built cannabis cultivation and extraction facility (the “Norfolk Expansion”) on a portion of the vacant land adjacent to the existing FIGR Norfolk Facility purchased by FIGR Norfolk in parcels in July 2018 and March 2019. The Norfolk Expansion design includes areas for cultivation, processing, oil production, extract production, edible production, and office space. The Norfolk Expansion design is modular in nature and is intended to accommodate the addition of subsequent phased expansions. FIGR Norfolk plans to break ground on the initial phase of the Norfolk Expansion in the current fiscal year.
FIGR Norfolk intends to rezone the acquired land as appropriate to satisfy the requirements of applicable municipal requirements. The construction of the Norfolk Expansion cannot begin until such rezoning is completed. Subject to successful rezoning and FIGR Norfolk obtaining necessary financing, construction of the Norfolk Expansion is planned to commence in the fourth quarter of 2019, and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2021. Subject to receipt of a license from Health Canada, the Norfolk Expansion is expected to be able to begin production in late 2021, with the ability to operate at full capacity by 2022. FIGR Norfolk expects that the licensing process for the Norfolk Expansion will consist of an amendment to its existing license rather than a new license application. 
Market and Competition
The current market for the Canadian cannabis businesses of FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk is Canada. Health Canada has issued a limited number of licenses under the Canadian Cannabis Act to produce and sell medical cannabis. As of May 31, 2019, there were limited licensed producers approved by Health Canada. As the demand in Canada for lawfully distributed cannabis products increases, the Company believes that new competitors will continue to attempt to enter the market, some of which may have greater resources than FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk. Additionally, Health Canada may accelerate its processing of applications, which may result in an acceleration in the rate at which applicants become licensed producers. 
Subsidiaries of the Company are exploring further international cannabis opportunities as other jurisdictions move towards establishing new or improved medical and/or recreational cannabis systems. As Canada has developed an early regulatory model, companies familiar with that framework have expertise and knowledge that may be useful in expanding to countries adopting 
 8
similar regulatory frameworks. Company subsidiaries will conduct cannabis business activities only in jurisdictions where such activities are permitted by applicable law.
Marketing
The Canadian Cannabis Act places a general ban on promotion of cannabis, cannabis accessories or any service related to cannabis, unless the promotional activity is specifically authorized under the Canadian Cannabis Act. Cannabis products may be promoted at their point of sale if the promotion indicates only its availability and/or price. Further, brand preference and informational promotion is permitted if such promotion is:

• | in a communication that is addressed and sent to an individual who is 18 years of age or older and is identified by name;


• | in a place where young persons are not permitted; or


• | communicated by means of a telecommunication, where the person responsible for the content of the promotion has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the promotion cannot be accessed by a young person.

As a result of the general prohibition against cannabis advertising under the Canadian Cannabis Act, investments in branding and other marketing activities may have limited effect on consumer perception of the products of FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk. FIGR East’s products are marketed under the brand “FIGR”. Subject to applicable regulatory approvals, it is expected that FIGR Norfolk will also market its products under the “FIGR” brand. 
The products sold by FIGR East, whether dried flower, pre-roll or cannabis oil, are identified with a production lot number. FIGR East intends to use the SENTRISM platform to permit retailers and consumers to enter the lot number into FIGR East’s website and obtain access to information regarding the production of that specific lot number, including where the product was grown, when it was harvested, the mother plant, terpene profile, cannabinoid content, and third-party testing data. FIGR East believes this commitment to production transparency will differentiate it in the Canadian cannabinoid market. FIGR Norfolk intends to use the same platform for its products following receipt of regulatory approvals permitting it to sell branded dried flower and other cannabis products to retailers for sale to consumers.
Regulation
The Canadian Cannabis Act and the regulations thereunder (the “Canadian Cannabis Regulations”) became effective on October 17, 2018, thereby legalizing the production, distribution, and sale of cannabis for adult non-medicinal (i.e., recreational) purpose, as well as incorporating the existing medical cannabis regulatory scheme under one complete framework. The Canadian Cannabis Regulations, among other things, provide more detailed rules and standards that apply to the legal cultivation, processing, research, testing, distribution, sale, importation, and exportation of cannabis in Canada by federal license holders under the Canadian Cannabis Act.
Pursuant to the federal regulatory framework in Canada, each province and territory may adopt its own laws governing the distribution, sale and consumption of cannabis and cannabis accessories within the province or territory. All Canadian provinces and territories have enacted their own legislation to regulate the distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes within those jurisdictions, and retail models vary between jurisdictions.
The Canadian Cannabis Regulations establish the following different classes of licenses that are required depending on the nature of the activity being undertaken:

• | Cultivation licenses-standard cultivation, micro-cultivation and nursery cultivation;


• | Processing licenses-standard processing and micro-processing;


• | Licenses for sale for medical purposes;


• | Analytical testing licenses;


• | Research licenses; and


• | Cannabis drug licenses.

Each class and subclass of license carries different rules and requirements that are intended to be proportional to the public health and safety risks posed by each license category and subclass. A license, once issued, identifies the specific activities that the licensee is authorized to conduct. 
 9
Licenses that were issued under the predecessor Canadian legislation are deemed to be licenses issued under the Canadian Cannabis Act. Licenses issued under the Canadian Cannabis Act have associated expiry dates and are subject to renewal requirements.
The Canadian Cannabis Act requires that certain individuals associated with a licensee, such as directors, officers, large shareholders and individuals identified by the Canadian Minister of Health (the "Health Minister”) obtain security clearances with Health Canada. The Health Minister will grant a security clearance if the Health Minister determines that the applicant does not pose an unacceptable risk to public health or public safety. The Health Minister may refuse to grant security clearance to individuals with associations to organized crime or with past criminal convictions for, or an association with, drug trafficking, corruption or violent offenses. Under the Canadian Cannabis Act, the Health Minister is also authorized to establish and maintain a national cannabis tracking system, and the Cannabis Tracking and Licensing System (the "CTLS") came into effect on October 17, 2018. The purpose of the CTLS is to track cannabis throughout the supply chain to help prevent diversion of cannabis into, and out of, the legal market. Each license holders are required to submit monthly reports to the Health Minister relating to inventory of its recreational and medical cannabis products under the CTLS.
The Canadian Cannabis Regulations set out the product categories that are permitted for sale. Currently, the Canadian Cannabis Regulations permit the sale of dried cannabis, cannabis oil, fresh cannabis, cannabis plants, and cannabis seeds, including in such forms as "pre-rolled" and capsule products. The THC content and serving size of cannabis products is limited by the Cannabis Regulations. Edibles, cannabis extracts and cannabis topicals are currently not permitted for sale. The Canadian federal government has published proposed amendments to the Canadian Cannabis Regulations, which are not yet in force, to permit the production and sale of these additional classes of cannabis by holders of federal licenses specific for these product classes. The Canadian federal government has communicated its intention to bring the proposed amendments into force by October 17, 2019.
For medical cannabis patients, Health Canada requires that medical documents be written to include the amount of dried cannabis in grams per day a patient may consume. This requirement applies equally to oils.
The Canadian Cannabis Regulations set out strict requirements pertaining to the packaging and labelling of cannabis products. Vendors must package cannabis in a way that is tamper-proof, child-resistant, prevents contamination and ensures dryness. The Canadian Cannabis Regulations also require plain packaging, with strict requirements for logos, colors and branding. For example, all-over packaging wraps must be clear, and the interior surface and exterior surface of any container in which a cannabis product is packaged must be one uniform color. The packaging must also contain the following product information:

• | product source information, including the class of cannabis and the name, phone number and email address of the cultivator;


• | a mandatory health warning, rotating between Heath Canada's list of standard health warnings;


• | the Health Canada standardized cannabis symbol; and


• | information specifying THC and CBD content.

As described above, the Canadian Cannabis Act places a general ban on promotion of cannabis, cannabis accessories or any service related to cannabis, unless the promotional activity is specifically authorized under the Canadian Cannabis Act. Cannabis products may be promoted at their point of sale if the promotion indicates only their availability and/or price. 
The Canadian Cannabis Act provides that the provinces and territories of Canada have authority to regulate certain aspects of recreational cannabis, such as sale and distribution, minimum age requirements, places where cannabis can be consumed, and a range of other matters. All Canadian provinces and territories have enacted regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes within those jurisdictions. There are three general frameworks that the provinces and territories have followed: (i) private cannabis retailers licensed by the province; (ii) government-run retail stores; or (iii) a combination of both frameworks (e.g., privately licensed retail stores, while online retailers are operated by the applicable provincial government).
Regardless of the provincial or territorial framework, the recreational cannabis market in Canada is required to be supplied by federally licensed producers. In many cases, provinces that follow the licensed private retailer model will still have a government-run wholesale distributor. Such licensed private retail stores are or will be required to obtain their cannabis products from the wholesalers, and the wholesalers in turn, are or will be required to obtain the cannabis products from the federally licensed producers. The minimum age for purchase and possession of cannabis in each Canadian jurisdiction is 19 years old, except for Quebec and Alberta, where it is 18.
E-liquids
The Company conducts an e-liquids business through its majority-owned, consolidated subsidiary, Humble Juice, and has investments in unconsolidated joint ventures with involvement in e-liquids businesses, Nicotine River and Purilum. Humble Juice sells branded, flavored e-liquids (that is, the liquid containing tobacco-derived nicotine used in vaporizers, electronic cigarettes, 
 10
and other vaping hardware and accessories) to retailers for sale to consumers. Nicotine River supplies liquid tobacco-derived nicotine to commercial e-liquid producers nationwide and also retails online the materials necessary to permit the home manufacture of e-liquids, including lab equipment, vegetable glycerin, liquid nicotine, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, flavor extracts, titration kits and do-it-yourself kits. Purilum develops and manufactures flavors and vapable products.
Nicotine River
Nicotine River is a liquid nicotine supplier to e-liquid manufacturers and do-it-yourself consumers that includes nicotine, flavors, and other components. Nicotine River also provides e-liquid manufacturing and bottling services to business-to-business customers. Nicotine River is registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) as a manufacturer of tobacco products (nicotine containing vaping products). Nicotine River operates out of a 45,000 square foot shared-facility in Thousand Oaks, California. Nicotine River shares this facility with Humble Juice.

Humble shares this facility with Nicotine River. Nicotine River performs bottling services for Humble Juice.
Purilum
Purilum offers flavor formulation and development for vaping products, including e-liquids. In addition to creating original flavors for customers, Purilum replicates formulations and flavors, matching brand requirements. In addition, Purilum develops and manufactures vaping products, including vapable oils and nicotine salts, for direct sale, as well as for business-to-business commerce. Purilum has developed a fully-automated bottling and filling service using filling machines. Using in-house developed vapable oil blends and original flavors, cartomizers, bottles and pods are filled and assembled in high volume to meet client demands. Every product manufactured by Purilum is identified with a specific lot number, and Purilum uses the SENTRISM platform for select brands. Historically, Purilum has produced flavors and e-liquid products. Recently, Purilum has been focusing its efforts on expanding its product offering with respect to hemp-derived CBD products and other cannabinoids, as regulations permit. 
Purilum operates an 18,000 square foot leased facility located in Greenville, North Carolina (the "Purilum Facility"), which includes on-site research and development capabilities for the design from the molecular level of new flavors and vaping products. Purilum is registered with the FDA as a manufacturer of tobacco products (nicotine containing vaping products).
Competition
The market for the e-liquid products is highly competitive and subject to rapid change and regulatory requirements. While historically the e-liquids niche of the vaping industry had low barriers to entry, recent regulatory requirements in the U.S. have created regulatory hurdles and approvals for new entrants to those markets. The e-liquids market is currently intensifying with continual innovations and upgrades being the primary characteristics of the market. The e-liquids market is highly fragmented, and many of the competitors of each of Humble Juice, Nicotine River and Purilum have significantly greater resources than it does. Each of Humble Juice, Nicotine River and Purilum competes primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, service, marketing, advertising and price.
Regulation
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has authority to regulate e-liquids, e-cigarettes and other vaping products that contain (or are used to consume e-liquid containing) tobacco-derived ingredients (e.g., nicotine) as "tobacco products" under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the "Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act"), as amended by Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (the "Tobacco Control Act"). Based on the December 2010 U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's decision in Sottera, Inc. v. Food & Drug Administration, the FDA cannot regulate such e-liquids, e-cigarettes and other vaping products as "drugs" or "devices" or "combination products" under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act unless they are marketed for therapeutic purposes. Since Humble Juice, Nicotine River and Purilum do not market their respective products for therapeutic purposes, their products that contain tobacco-derived nicotine are subject to regulation as "tobacco products" under the Tobacco Control Act.
Although the FDA is prohibited from issuing regulations banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products, or requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act grants the FDA broad authority to impose restrictions on the design, manufacture, distribution, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products. Furthermore, the FDA may be required to issue future regulations regarding the promotion and marketing of tobacco products sold or distributed over the internet, by mail order or through other non-face-to-face transactions in order to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors. The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act also required the FDA to establish a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee to provide advice, information and recommendations with respect to the safety, dependence or health issues related to tobacco products. The FDA's implementation of authorities granted by the Tobacco Control Act could result in a decrease in tobacco product sales in the United States, including the sales of the e-liquid products.
 11
Following the Sottera decision, the FDA indicated that it intended to regulate e-cigarettes under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act through the issuance of "Deeming Regulations" that would subject e-liquids, e-cigarettes, and other vaping products that qualify as "tobacco products" to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act's requirements added by the Tobacco Control Act and the FDA's jurisdiction. On May 10, 2016, the FDA issued the "Deeming Regulations," which came into effect August 8, 2016. The Deeming Regulations extended the FDA's "tobacco products" authorities to apply to most previously unregulated products that meet the statutory definition of "tobacco product," including e-liquids, e-cigarettes and other vaping products that contain (or are used to consume e-liquid containing) tobacco-derived ingredients. Deemed tobacco products in this segment include, but are not limited to, e-liquids, atomizers, batteries, cartomizers, clearomisers, tank systems, flavors, bottles that contain e-liquids and programmable software ("Deemed Tobacco Products"). Beginning August 8, 2016, Deemed Tobacco Products became subject to all existing statutory controls initially applicable only to cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless tobacco as well as some existing and some new FDA regulations related to the sale and distribution of Deemed Tobacco Products. As a result, Deemed Tobacco Products are now subject to various federal restrictions and requirements, including without limitation: 

• | a prohibition on sales to those younger than 18 years of age and requirements for verification by means of photographic identification by purchasers under 27;


• | requirements to include addictiveness warnings on product packages and in advertisements;


• | a ban on vending machine sales unless the vending machines are located in a facility where the retailer ensures that individuals under 18 years of age are prohibited from entering at any time;


• | requirements for owners and operators of domestic tobacco product manufacturing establishments to register their establishments with the FDA and submit listings of products manufactured at those establishments to the FDA;


• | requirements for submission of health documents, ingredient listings, and listings of the quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents in products and their emissions;


• | a prohibition on marketing of "new tobacco products" (i.e., products not commercially marketed in the United States "as of" February 15, 2007, or modified in any physical respect since) without prior FDA authorization;


• | a prohibition on making direct and implied claims of reduced risk such as "light", "low" and "mild" descriptors unless FDA confirms (a) that scientific evidence supports the claim and (b) that marketing the product will benefit public health; and


• | a ban on the distribution of free samples.

As noted above, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act requires that any Deemed Tobacco Product that was not commercially marketed as of the "grandfathering" date of February 15, 2007, obtain premarket approval before it can be marketed in the United States. However, the FDA has announced a compliance policy for such Deemed Tobacco Products that qualify as "new tobacco products" and that the agency will not enforce these requirements for non-finished products (i.e., those intended solely for use in future manufacturing), which include certain products manufactured by Purilum. The current compliance policy allows companies to market finished non-combusted Deemed Tobacco Products that qualify as "new tobacco products" that were on the U.S. market on August 8, 2016, until August 8, 2022, and continued marketing of such products during the FDA's review of a pending marketing application submitted by August 8, 2022. In the absence of this policy, Humble Juice, Nicotine River and Purilum would have had to obtain prior authorization from FDA to market these products after August 8, 2016. Accordingly, such finished e-liquid products all are marketed pursuant to FDA's current compliance policy based on evidence that they were on the U.S. market on August 8, 2016, and have not been physically modified since.
On March 13, 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance to modify the current compliance policy for certain Deemed Tobacco Products that qualify as “new tobacco products,” have not received a marketing authorization from the FDA, and were on the U.S. market on August 8, 2016. Relevant to vaping products (e.g., e-liquids), the guidance proposes to change the deadline for submitting a marketing application for flavored products (other than tobacco-, mint-, and menthol-flavored products) from August 8, 2022, to August 8, 2021. The guidance also proposes that, even during the compliance policy period, the FDA would prioritize enforcement of the premarket review requirements for such flavored products when offered for sale in ways that pose a greater risk for minors to access such products. This includes enforcement against such flavored products sold: (1) in locations that minors may enter at any time; (2) through retailers (including online retailers) that have sold to minors after the FDA finalizes the document, (3) through online retailers lacking sufficient third-party age- and identity-verification services, and (4) through online retailers with no limit on the quantity that a customer may purchase within a given time period. The guidance also proposes that, even during the compliance policy period, the FDA similarly would enforce the premarket review requirements against all vaping products promoted to minors or marketed in a manner likely to promote use by minors. It remains unclear whether or when the FDA will issue a final 
 12
version of the draft guidance document, whether the FDA will finalize the document in the form proposed, precisely how the FDA will implement the proposed policy changes, or whether, in response to potential legal challenges to any final version of the document, the FDA could implement the policies during the pendency of such litigation.
On May 15, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland issued a decision that may have a future impact on the FDA’s compliance policy for deemed “new tobacco products” on the market on the August 8, 2016 effective date of the Deeming Regulations. In response to a complaint filed by public health groups and individual physicians, the court issued an order vacating the guidance document announcing the FDA’s compliance policy described above. The court has ordered briefing on the potential remedy. The court’s decision could ultimately result in the FDA’s establishing a substantially earlier deadline for filing marketing applications for finished, nicotine-containing vaping products than even the August 8, 2021, revised deadline proposed by the FDA in its March 13, 2019 draft guidance. The ultimate outcome of this decision, including any appeals, remains uncertain.
FDA authorization to introduce a "new tobacco product" (or to continue marketing a "new tobacco product" covered by the current or potentially modified compliance policy for Deemed Tobacco Products on the U.S. market on August 8, 2016) could be obtained via any of the following three authorization pathways: (1) submission of a premarket tobacco product application ("PMTA") and receipt of a marketing authorization order; (2) submission of a substantial equivalence report and receipt of a substantial equivalence order; or (3) submission of a request for an exemption from substantial equivalence requirements and receipt of a substantial equivalence exemption determination. The Company cannot predict if the finished, nicotine-containing e-liquid products of Humble Juice, Nicotine River and Purilum, all of which would be considered "new tobacco products," will receive the required premarket approval from the FDA if they were to seek premarket approval through an available authorization pathway. 
Since there were few, if any, e-liquid, e-cigarette or other vaping products on the market as of February 15, 2007, there is no way to utilize the less onerous substantial equivalence or substantial equivalence exemption pathways that traditional tobacco corporations can utilize for cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and other traditional tobacco products. In order to obtain premarket approval, manufacturers of practically all e-liquid, e-cigarette or other vaping products would have to use the PMTA pathway, which could potentially cost hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions of dollars per application. Furthermore, the Deeming Regulations created a significant barrier to entry for any new e-liquid, e-cigarette or other vaping product seeking to enter the market after August 8, 2016, since any such product would require an FDA marketing authorization through one of the aforementioned pathways.

State and local governments also currently regulate tobacco products, including nicotine-containing vaping products. Certain municipalities have enacted local ordinances that prohibit the use of e-liquid, e-cigarette and other vaping products where traditional tobacco-burning cigarettes cannot be used, and certain local jurisdictions have enacted total or partial bans on the sale of flavored tobacco products, including e-liquid, e-cigarette and other vaping products. A growing number of states have imposed excise taxes on e-liquids, e-cigarettes, and other vaping products. Other states and local jurisdictions have increased the minimum age to purchase such products to 19 or 21, have imposed restrictions or prohibitions on internet sales of such products, and have challenged the marketing of such products under consumer protection statutes (e.g., on the basis that certain marketers unlawfully target underage consumers or make unsubstantiated or misleading claims about their products). 
On June 7, 2019, Humble Juice received a warning letter from the FDA asserting violations of nicotine-warning-label requirements with respect to certain social media posting regarding Humble Juice’s e-liquid products and potential violations in social media postings requiring the disclosure of connections, if any, with product endorsers. In its warning letter, the FDA requested that Humble Juice respond to the FDA with respect to these matters, with a description of corrective actions and its plan to maintain compliance with the specified regulatory requirements. Humble Juice intends to promptly investigate the matters identified in the warning letter, respond to the FDA as requested and take all necessary corrective actions to maintain compliance with such requirements.
Industrial Hemp
In addition, the Company has an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture, Criticality, which produces a line of industrial hemp-derived CBD products. The Company sources industrial hemp from growers to supply Criticality.
Industrial Hemp Sourcing
The Company contracts with growers on an annual basis to purchase their crop for supply to Criticality. The Company provides growers with growing expertise, best practices, and a dependable route-to-market for their hemp crops. The Company procures industrial hemp from farmers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and New York. Company representatives regularly visit grow locations to provide grower assistance, agronomic expertise, and ensure compliance with quality and regulatory requirements. Criticality’s in-house hemp specialists also visit farmers and supports the Company’s agricultural teams. The Company uses its SENTRISM platform to track products from cultivation and provides that data to Criticality to allow continuous tracking through to extraction, consumer product formulation and packaging, providing consumers of Criticality’s products with transparent insight throughout the supply chain.

Criticality
Criticality offers a line of industrial hemp-derived CBD products through its consumer brand, "Korent". In May 2019, Criticality launched its "Korent Select" brand of hemp-derived CBD products. The various product classifications are designed to appeal to a range of consumers with varying preferences as to delivery method and CBD concentration. "Korent" currently includes products delivering hemp-derived CBD in vapable oils and oil drops. "Korent Select" includes products delivering hemp-derived CBD in multiple formats, including oil drops and topicals. 
Hemp-derived CBD used in Criticality's products is extracted from industrial hemp plant material using Criticality's high pressure carbon dioxide extraction process. Every "Korent" branded product sold by Criticality is identified with a production lot number. Criticality intends to use the SENTRISM platform to enable retailers and consumers to enter the lot number into Korent's website, and view where the product was grown, learn about the farmer behind the product, when it was harvested, its cannabinoid content, and testing and release data. Criticality is currently developing its SENTRISM customer interface, and is offering an alternative customer interface while the SENTRISM interface is being developed. 
Criticality operates a CBD extraction facility located in Wilson, North Carolina (the "Criticality Facility"). Criticality currently uses 55,000 square feet of the Criticality Facility, which is leased, while the total square footage of the Criticality Facility is approximately 85,000 square feet, allowing for potential expansion although Criticality does not expect to expand operations at the Criticality Facility in the near-term. CBD extraction operations at the Criticality Facility commenced in April 2019, while Criticality initiated its hemp processing research and development efforts in 2017 at a pilot-scale extraction facility in Hobgood, North Carolina. At the Criticality Facility, Criticality employs its carbon-dioxide based supercritical fluid extraction process to extract CBD oil from industrial hemp plant material. Criticality's products are subject to testing and analysis at multiple points throughout the manufacturing process, which Criticality believes enhances safety, purity, and consistency in its products.
In the case of vapable products and oil drops, Criticality engages with Purilum to prepare such products from the CBD oil provided by Criticality. Criticality places orders with Purilum individually as consumer demands merit, and does not have a fixed contractual arrangement with Purilum. In the case of ingestibles and topical products, Criticality outsources manufacturing to third-party contract manufacturers to prepare finished products for consumers. Purilum and applicable third-party contract manufacturers label and package the finished products according to Criticality's specifications. Following final validation testing of samples, the finished products are released for distribution. Criticality's "Korent" branded products are currently sold in the United States through its website and at select retail locations.
Criticality also offers bulk CBD oil on a business-to-business, direct fulfillment basis.
The market for CBD products is highly competitive and highly fragmented. Many of the Criticality’s competitors have significantly greater resources than it does, access to more retail distribution channels and a longer operating history. Criticality competes primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, production chain transparency, marketing, advertising and price.
Regulation
In 2014, Congress enacted section 7606 of the Agriculture Act of 2014 (the "2014 Farm Bill"), which provides for the domestic cultivation of industrial hemp as part of agricultural pilot programs adopted by individual states for the purposes of research by state departments of agriculture and institutions of higher education. The 2014 Farm Bill provides for the domestic cultivation of industrial hemp, in those pilot programs, notwithstanding other federal laws such as the Controlled Substances Act. The 2014 Farm Bill governs any current domestic production of industrial hemp.
The 2014 Farm Bill's provisions require states that choose to adopt agricultural pilot programs to do so in order to study the growth, cultivation or marketing of industrial hemp in a manner that (i) ensures that only institutions of higher education and state agriculture departments are used to grow or cultivate industrial hemp; (ii) requires that sites used for growing or cultivating industrial hemp be certified with, and registered by, the states; and (iii) authorizes state agriculture departments to regulate the pilot programs. Within those parameters, the 2014 Farm Bill gives significant discretion to states to determine whether or not to adopt an industrial hemp pilot program, and to adopt regulations governing industrial hemp (including marketing research involving products derived from industrial hemp) under those pilot programs. Many of the states that have adopted pilot programs have registered private companies to participate in the pilot programs. Criticality is a registered processor of industrial hemp under North Carolina’s agricultural pilot program.
Under the 2014 Farm Bill, any cannabis plant, plant part or plant product that contains a higher concentration of THC than permitted in industrial hemp is considered a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act (i.e., marihuana) and is not protected by the 2014 Farm Bill. In addition, as of the date of this report, any industrial hemp plant, plant part or plant product that is produced outside of a state agricultural pilot program may be considered unlawful but not a controlled substance.
 14
On December 20, 2018, the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (the "2018 Farm Bill") was enacted. When fully implemented, the 2018 Farm Bill will permit broad commercial production of hemp outside of the current state agricultural pilot programs for industrial hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, removes hemp and its derivatives (including cannabinoids such as CBD), from the Controlled Substances Act and amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to allow for hemp production and sale in the United States, subject to other laws, including those of the individual states. Most notably, the 2018 Farm Bill did not amend the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which remains applicable to any hemp-derived products, including those containing CBD, sold in interstate commerce.
In place of agricultural pilot programs, the 2018 Farm Bill provides for commercial production of hemp and permits states to assert primary regulatory authority over hemp production, if they choose to do so. States choosing to assert such authority may adopt their own plans for regulating hemp production, which must comply with specified statutory criteria (e.g., that the states identify land where hemp is grown, test hemp for the appropriate THC concentration, adopt procedures to destroy non-conforming plants, and follow the federal enforcement scheme). Those state plans must be approved by the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), which must promulgate implementing regulations that the agency has indicated will, among other things, establish more-detailed procedures regarding submission and approval of state hemp plans. For hemp production in states without approved plans, producers must comply with an umbrella hemp plan established by the USDA and obtain licenses from the USDA. The USDA is expected to establish the terms of its umbrella hemp plan and the licensure procedures in the same implementing regulations.
The USDA has deferred review and approval of state plans, establishing its umbrella plan for hemp production in states without approved plans, and issuance of federal licenses to producers in such states until the agency promulgates final implementing regulations. Until such time as the USDA issues such final regulations, commercial hemp production under the 2018 Farm Bill cannot legally begin. However, research-related activities involving industrial hemp under the more-restrictive 2014 Farm Bill, such as those permitted by the North Carolina agricultural pilot program, may continue. The USDA has expressed an intention to issue such final regulations in time for producers to cultivate hemp for commercial purposes during the 2020 growing season specifically by August 2019. However, the timing and content of the USDA’s final implementing regulations cannot be assured. Moreover, the 2018 Farm Bill permits states to establish additional restrictions on hemp production and hemp products than required under federal law, although states may not interfere with the interstate transportation of hemp or hemp products produced in compliance with the 2018 Farm Bill. Further, in May 2019, the USDA issued a legal opinion asserting its view that states may not interfere with the interstate transportation of industrial hemp or products derived from industrial hemp produced in compliance with the 2014 Farm Bill, although whether the individual states will heed and reviewing courts will defer to this opinion remains uncertain.
Under the 2018 Farm Bill, any cannabis plant, plant part or plant product that contains a higher concentration of THC than permitted in hemp is still considered a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act (i.e., marihuana) and is not protected by the 2018 Farm Bill. Further, the 2018 Farm Bill specifies certain consequences for domestic production of hemp in violation of the applicable state or USDA hemp plan. These include potential disqualification from hemp production for a five-year period beginning on the date of a third violation.
Further, under the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA has retained authority over hemp, including CBD derived from hemp, in products that qualify as regulated articles under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, including foods, drugs, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. The statutory text of that law expressly did not alter authority of the FDA over hemp-derived products, including hemp-derived CBD products, under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA has committed to regulating hemp-derived products sold in interstate commerce to the extent that they qualify as regulated articles under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act-i.e., they meet the statutory definition of “food,” “drug,” “cosmetic,” etc.
In particular, the FDA has continued to assert its view that the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act prohibits the marketing of CBD dietary supplements, regardless of whether the CBD is hemp-derived, because CBD was not marketed as a food or dietary supplement prior to the authorization of substantial clinical investigations of CBD-containing drug products. Further, the FDA has continued to assert that CBD cannot be added to conventional food sold in interstate commerce because CBD was not marketed in food prior to the initiation of substantial clinical investigations of CBD-containing drug products. Stakeholders have questioned the validity of the FDA’s stated positions as applied to some or all CBD-containing food or dietary supplement products (e.g., those containing full- or broad-spectrum hemp extracts containing naturally occurring quantities of CBD). Regardless, the FDA has express statutory authority to issue regulations permitting the marketing of CBD dietary supplements and use of CBD as a conventional food additive, although the FDA has never previously used these authorities to promulgate regulations permitting use of active drug ingredients in dietary supplements and conventional foods.
While the FDA has taken preliminary steps to explore the possibility of using these authorities and continues to invite submission of evidence establishing the prior marketing of CBD dietary supplements and CBD-containing foods, there can be no assurance that the FDA will change its current positions or proceed with issuing regulations overriding the statutory provisions on which the agency relies in asserting its current positions. Even if the FDA chooses to proceed with rulemaking, the timing and content of 
 15
any final regulations cannot be assured. In addition, even if FDA ultimately permits the marketing of CBD dietary supplements or CBD-containing conventional foods, such products must otherwise comply with all applicable requirements of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the FDA’s implementing regulations and policies for these categories of products, including restrictions on the types of claims that marketers may make for them. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") regulates advertising of all products, including for FDA-regulated articles made from hemp and CBD derived from hemp.
Under the 2014 Farm Bill, many states have adopted agricultural pilot programs to study the growth, cultivation or marketing of industrial hemp. The 2014 Farm Bill provided that “only institutions of higher education and State departments of agriculture are used to grow or cultivate industrial hemp.” States that have chosen to adopt agricultural pilot programs have varied in the extent to which private entities are permitted to participate in those pilot programs and the mechanisms for those commercial entities to do so. A common requirement for those programs is that all sites must be certified by, and registered with, the state agriculture departments. The registration mechanisms vary from state to state.
In North Carolina, where Criticality is based, the state general assembly passed Senate Bill 313 (as amended, the “NC Hemp Act”) on October 31, 2015, establishing a state pilot program to research the cultivation of industrial hemp. Consistent with the 2014 Farm Bill, the NC Hemp Act defined industrial hemp to include any part of the cannabis plant, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis. The NC Hemp Act further created a North Carolina Industrial Hemp Commission (the “NC Hemp Commission”) to oversee the state’s pilot program. The NC Hemp Commission was charged with, among other things, issuing licenses allowing persons, firms or corporations to cultivate industrial hemp for research purposes. The NC Hemp Act provided that those licensed to grow and cultivate industrial hemp under the pilot program could engage in any of eleven authorized research-related activities, including, among others, studying and investigating marketplace opportunities for hemp products; studying and investigating methods of industrial hemp cultivation; studying the economic feasibility of developing an industrial hemp market in various types of industrial hemp that can be grown in the state, including by commercial marketing and sale of industrial hemp; researching and promoting on the world market industrial hemp and hemp seed that can be grown in the state; and promoting research into the development of industrial hemp and commercial markets for North Carolina industrial hemp and hemp products. The NC Hemp Act also provides for civil and criminal penalties for, among others, those who violate the terms of the act or NC Hemp Commission rules or attempt to disguise marijuana by growing it in close proximity to industrial hemp. The North Carolina Department of Agriculture provides administrative support to the NC Hemp Commission and the research program is managed by State of North Carolina land grant universities. Criticality is a registered processor of industrial hemp under North Carolina’s agricultural pilot program.
In July 2017, the North Carolina Hemp Commission passed a resolution providing guidance to licensed growers, registered processors, registered farm aggregators, and others participants in the North Carolina industrial hemp pilot program. It noted that processed industrial hemp products, specifically excluding viable seeds and/or plants, may be imported into the United States and then freely bought and sold in commerce to the same extent as other like-kind goods. Interpreting the “plain language” of the 2014 Farm Bill, the North Carolina Hemp Commission found that the “marketing of industrial hemp products is part and parcel of what Congress authorized in connection with state pilot programs” and further that the 2014 Farm Bill “placed no restriction upon the marketing of hemp.” The North Carolina Hemp Commission thus reached the “inexorable conclusion that products flowing from lawfully established pilot programs are accorded the same badges of legitimacy and legality as are the imported hemp products specifically protected by the federal court’s decision in Hemp Industries Association,” a Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals decision which enjoined the enforcement of an FDA rule that would have banned non-hallucinogenic hemp products for human consumption. Based on these findings and an advisory opinion from the North Carolina Department of Justice that “Congress intended to allow industrial hemp grown for research purposes to be transported outside the state of origin,” in order to place North Carolina pilot program participants on the same footing as international growers, processors, wholesalers, and retailers, the North Carolina Hemp Commission resolved that licensed farmers, registered farm aggregators, and processors operating under the North Carolina industrial hemp pilot program may purchase from or sell live industrial hemp plants or seeds or propagules to both international and United States-based suppliers, and further resolved that licensed farmers may sell their industrial hemp crops, including seeds, propagules, plants and plant parts, to local, out of state, and international buyers and processors.
Under the 2018 Farm Bill, states may adopt plans for broader commercial production of hemp outside of agricultural pilot programs and for purposes other than research. The 2018 Farm Bill sets certain broad statutory guidelines for state plans (e.g., that the states identify land where industrial hemp is grown, test industrial hemp for the appropriate THC concentration, adopt procedures to destroy non-conforming plants, and follow the federal enforcement scheme). As discussed above, until the USDA promulgates its final regulations implementing the 2018 Farm Bill’s hemp production provisions, the agency does not plan to approve state plans, authorize commercial hemp production in states without approved state hemp plans under the terms of its umbrella hemp plan, or issue licenses to hemp producers in such states. Thus, industrial hemp production will generally continue to be governed by current state agricultural pilot program regulations, including in North Carolina.
In addition to regulating hemp and industrial hemp under the aegis of the 2014 and 2018 Farm Bills, states regulate hemp and industrial hemp in other ways. States, including North Carolina, have retained regulatory authority through their own analogs to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and have the authority to regulate the marketing of hemp and industrial hemp products, including 
 16
CBD products, in food, drugs, dietary supplements and cosmetics, as well as the claims made about them. Some states have adopted the FDA’s positions regarding CBD dietary supplements and CBD in conventional foods. Other states have not established industrial hemp pilot programs or otherwise prohibit the sale of all or certain hemp and industrial hemp products, including CBD products, under state controlled substances laws that do include the same exceptions for excluded parts and hemp found in the federal Controlled Substances Act, as amended by the 2018 Farm Bill, or that restrict the sale of such products only for certain limited medical uses. Some states’ industrial hemp pilot programs restrict or prohibit the marketing of all or certain industrial hemp products. In addition, the sales and marketing of hemp and industrial hemp products, including CBD products, are subject to regulation by state consumer regulatory and health agencies, and are subject to enforcement actions by state attorneys general. 
Criticality currently processes industrial hemp sourced from and grown by licensed growers operating under North Carolina’s agricultural pilot program. It may in the future source industrial hemp from growers located in and operating under the agricultural pilot programs of other states. It also may in the future source hemp cultivated under the 2018 Farm Bill from growers operating under approved state plans or under the USDA’s umbrella plan. Further, consistent with the research purposes articulated in the North Carolina Hemp Act and North Carolina Hemp Commission guidance, Criticality sells industrial hemp-derived products, including CBD products, to consumers in other states. Accordingly, Criticality’s industrial hemp activities are and likely will continue to be governed by a complex fabric of rapidly evolving and sometimes-conflicting federal and state laws and regulations, including among others the unique and varied laws of the states from which Criticality sources its hemp and industrial hemp and to which Criticality ships its products. The Company cannot provide assurance that all states will amend their laws to mirror the federal Controlled Substances Act’s exclusions for hemp or otherwise permit the broad commercial distribution of hemp-derived products, including CBD products.
