Item 1. Business
National Vision Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to here as “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” or “National Vision.” National Vision Holdings, Inc. conducts substantially all of its activities through its direct, wholly-owned subsidiary, National Vision, Inc. (“NVI”), and NVI’s subsidiaries.

General
We are one of the largest and fastest growing optical retailers in the United States and a leader in the attractive value segment of the U.S. optical retail industry. We believe that vision is central to quality of life and that people deserve to see their best to live their best, no matter what their budget. Our mission is to make quality eye care and eyewear affordable and accessible to all Americans. We achieve this by providing eye exams, eyeglasses and contact lenses to cost-conscious and low-income consumers. We deliver exceptional value and convenience to our customers, with an opening price point that strives to be among the lowest in the industry, enabled by our low-cost operating platform. We reach our customers through a diverse portfolio of 1,082 retail stores across five brands and 19 consumer websites as of December 29, 2018, our 2018 fiscal year end. 
Our History
Through its predecessors, NVI commenced operations in 1990. In 2005, private equity funds managed by Berkshire Partners LLC (“Berkshire”) acquired both NVI and Consolidated Vision Group, Inc., which operated America’s Best stores, and merged these entities, with NVI surviving. In 2009, NVI acquired the Eyeglass World store chain. In 2011, after a multi-year partnership, NVI acquired Arlington Contact Lens Service, Inc. (“AC Lens”) to bolster its e-commerce platform.
In March 2014, NVI was acquired (the “KKR Acquisition”) by affiliates of KKR & Co. Inc. (“KKR Sponsor” or “KKR”). National Vision Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on February 14, 2014 under the name “Nautilus Parent, Inc.” and NVI became our wholly-owned subsidiary in connection with the KKR Acquisition. In 2017, we changed our name to “National Vision Holdings, Inc.” 
In October 2017, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock (the “IPO”). Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “EYE.” National Vision was controlled by affiliates of KKR Sponsor and private equity funds managed by Berkshire until July 30, 2018. KKR Sponsor and Berkshire are collectively referred to herein as the “Sponsors.” Our principal executive offices are located at 2435 Commerce Avenue, Bldg. 2200, Duluth, Georgia 30096.

Our Business Model
Our history of profitable growth is founded on a commitment to a relatively simple business model: providing exceptional value and convenience to customers, enabled by our low-cost operating platform. Our disciplined approach to new store openings, combined with our attractive store economics, has led to strong returns on investment. The following chart depicts our new store growth:

Note: Represents stores in operations across all five company retail brands at the end of each fiscal year.

The fundamentals of our model are described below:

• | Differentiated and Defensible Value Proposition. We believe our success is driven by our low prices, convenient locations, broad assortment of branded and private label merchandise and the high levels of in-store service provided by our well-trained and passionate store associates and vision care professionals. We believe our bundled offers, including two-pairs of eyeglasses plus an eye exam for $69.95 at America’s Best and two-pairs of eyeglasses for $78 at Eyeglass World, represent among the lowest price offerings of any national chain. Our ability to utilize national advertising for America’s Best allows us to communicate this value proposition to a meaningfully greater number of current and potential customers. We believe that our value proposition will continue to drive comparable store sales growth as we attract new customers and increase loyalty with existing customers.


• | Recurring Revenue Characteristics. Eye care purchases are predominantly a medical necessity and are therefore considered non-discretionary in nature. We estimate that optical consumers typically replace their eyeglasses every two to three years, while contact lens customers typically order new lenses every six to twelve months, reflecting the predictability of these recurring purchase behaviors. This is further demonstrated by the customer mix of our mature stores, with existing customers representing 64% of total customers in 2018 and new customers representing the remaining 36% of total customers in 2018.


• | Attractive Store Economics. Since 2006, we have opened 640 stores in the aggregate, including 615 stores under our America’s Best and Eyeglass World retail brands. Our store economics are based on low capital investment, steady ramping of sales in new locations, low operating costs and consistent sales volume and earnings growth in mature stores, which result in attractive returns on capital. The majority of our owned stores have achieved profitability during the second year of operation and, have paid back invested capital in three to five years. By consistently replicating the key characteristics of our store model, we execute a formula-based approach to opening new stores and managing existing stores, which has delivered predictable store performance across vintages, diverse geographies and new and existing markets.

Our Mission and Philanthropic Efforts
Our mission is to help people by making quality eye care and eyewear more affordable and accessible. Our financial success has helped fuel our ever-growing philanthropic engine. Through multiple charitable partnerships with organizations such as VisionSpring, RestoringVision and Vosh International, we have directly assisted approximately one million individuals to see and have indirectly helped improve the vision of millions of individuals globally. In addition, through our partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, we provide free vision screenings, eye exams and eyeglasses to thousands of young Americans. We also work diligently to help a portion of the world’s population who live with uncorrected vision problems. Our philanthropic culture instills a sense of purpose and engagement in our associates, from in-store staff to senior management. Our associates feel pride in the positive work they are doing, which allows us to attract and retain both store associates and vision care professionals, thus improving the customer experience in our stores. In addition, our mission has been essential to the formation and retention of our cohesive management team, whose extensive experience is a key component of our business success.

Our Business
We are well positioned to serve our new and existing customers through a diverse portfolio of 1,082 retail stores across five brands and 19 consumer websites as of December 29, 2018. We have two reportable segments: our owned & host segment and our legacy segment. Our owned & host segment includes our two owned brands, America’s Best and Eyeglass World, and our Vista Optical locations in Fred Meyer stores. Within this segment, we also provide low-cost vision care products and services to American military service members by operating Vista Optical locations on select military bases across the country. Our legacy segment consists of our 28-year strategic relationship with Walmart to operate Vision Centers in select Walmart stores. In addition, our wholly-owned subsidiary, FirstSight Vision Services, Inc. (“FirstSight”), which is licensed as a single-service health plan under California law, issues individual vision care benefit plans in connection with our America’s Best operations in California and arranges for the provision of optometric services at optometric offices next to certain Walmart stores throughout California. We support our owned brands and our Vista Optical military operations through our ever-evolving omni-channel offerings and we also have an established standalone e-commerce business. Our e-commerce platform serves our proprietary e-commerce websites and the e-commerce websites of third parties, including Walmart, Sam’s Club and Giant Eagle. The following table provides an overview of our portfolio of brands:

Our America’s Best Brand. America’s Best strives to be the value leader in virtually every market in which it operates. Its signature offer of “two pairs of eyeglasses for $69.95, including a free eye exam”, is typically priced significantly lower than the competition on a per-pair basis and provides customers with a wide selection of frame choices at this entry point. In America’s Best stores, vision care services are provided primarily by optometrists employed either by us or by independent professional corporations. This model facilitates the brand’s bundled offer and its Eyecare Club programs, which offer two free eye exams per year for the duration of the membership plus a discount on contact lenses and eyeglasses. By leveraging our efficient centralized laboratory network, America’s Best stores are able to minimize processing costs and drive significant economies of scale. These stores typically stock approximately 1,320 eyeglass frame SKUs, including imports from low-cost overseas manufacturers, higher-margin private label brands and discounted well-known frame brands. America’s Best stores, which average 3,500 square feet, are primarily located in high-traffic strip centers next to similar off-price designer retailers, such as Marshalls stores.
Our Eyeglass World Brand. Eyeglass World also offers a value price point for customers, with an opening offer of “two pairs of eyeglasses for $78” and eye exams starting at $49. This brand is positioned as an eyeglass superstore that caters to a more cost-conscious customer base, with a broader selection of designer brands and price points, and offers more personalized levels of service. We source eyeglass frames for our Eyeglass World stores from leading designer brands, private label manufacturers, overstock inventories and low-cost overseas manufacturers. Eyeglass World locations offer eye exams, primarily from independent optometrists and optometrists employed by independent professional corporations, and have on-site laboratories that enable stores to quickly fulfill customer orders and make repairs. On-site laboratories can process a variety of lens options, with same-day service. Lens orders that are not completed in-store are completed by our centralized laboratory network. Due to the wider brand selection and on-site laboratories, Eyeglass World stores are larger, averaging approximately 4,500 square feet and typically stocking approximately 1,935 eyeglass frame SKUs. These stores are primarily located in freestanding or in-line locations near high-foot-traffic shopping centers.
Our Partner Brands. We have three partner brands consisting of 227 Vision Centers in Walmart stores across the country, 54 Vista Optical locations on military bases and 29 Vista Optical locations within Fred Meyer stores as of December 29, 2018. We have strong, long-standing relationships with these partners. Our strategic relationship with Walmart extends over 28 years and our partnerships with Fred Meyer and the U.S. military have been maintained for over 19 years. Our partner brands all compete within the value segment of the U.S. optical retail industry, with a starting price point for a pair of eyeglasses in the $38 to $99 range. These brands combine a broad selection of products and attentive customer service with the convenience of one-stop shopping. These brands also utilize our centralized laboratories and provide eye exams principally by independent optometrists in nearly all locations. Our partner brands are attractive businesses with relatively light capital requirements.
Our Omni-Channel and E-Commerce Platforms. We offer our customers an engaging digital shopping experience through an established platform of three omni-channel store websites, and 16 dedicated e-commerce consumer websites. Our omni-channel store websites augment our America’s Best, Eyeglass World and Vista Optical in military brands and provide a customer experience that extends across our in-store, mobile and e-commerce channels. We offer a range of services to customers, including eyeglass purchasing, online scheduling and appointment reminders, contact lens purchasing, “buy-in-store and ship-to-home” capabilities, online frame browsing and virtual frame try-on, among others. Our omni-channel offerings work in concert with these brands to enhance the overall quality of the customer experience.
Our 16 dedicated e-commerce websites are managed by our subsidiary, AC Lens. AC Lens operates six proprietary branded websites, including aclens.com and discountcontacts.com. In addition, AC Lens operates and provides support services for 10 third-party websites owned by other companies, including Walmart, Sam’s Club and Giant Eagle. AC Lens handles site management, customer relationship management and order fulfillment and also sells a wide variety of contact lenses, eyeglasses and eye care accessories. In the aggregate, sales from our omni-channel and e-commerce platforms represented approximately 3.5% of our net revenue in fiscal year 2018.
Our Industry
The U.S. optical retail industry, defined by Vision Monday to include optical retailers’ revenues from the sales of products (including managed vision care benefit revenues and omni-channel and e-commerce sales) and eye care services provided by vision care professionals, including eye exams, is a $35 billion industry that has exhibited consistent, stable growth across economic cycles. According to Vision Monday, over the period from 2007 to 2017, the industry grew from $26 billion to $35 billion in annual sales, representing a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3.1%. The industry experienced only a modest decline during the 2008 to 2009 recession and rebounded with robust post-recession sales growth of 4.0% CAGR from 2009 to 2017, according to Vision Monday. The steady growth of the industry and its resilience to economic cycles is due in large part to the medical, non-discretionary and recurring nature of eye care purchases.

The majority of eyewear purchases are driven by need, with two primary drivers of demand: (i) diminishing eyesight with increasing age, causing new customers to buy corrective eyewear and (ii) a steady and consistent replacement cycle, as customers frequently replace or purchase new eyewear for a variety of reasons, including changes in prescriptions, fashion trends and necessity (e.g., lost or broken eyewear).
The need for eyesight correction is diagnosed through eye tests and eye exams. 
We anticipate that there are four key secular growth trends that will continue to contribute to the stability and growth of the U.S. optical retail industry: 

• | Aging Population. According to The Vision Council, over 76% of adults in the United States used some form of vision correction as of September 2018. At age 45, the need for vision correction begins to increase significantly, with approximately 86% of adults in the United States between the ages of 45 and 54 and approximately 92% of adults in the United States aged 55 and older using vision correction, according to The Vision Council. As the U.S. population ages and life expectancy increases, the pool of potential customers and opportunities for repeat purchases in the optical retail industry are anticipated to rise. Given that eyesight deteriorates progressively with age, aging of the U.S. population should result in incremental sales of eyewear and related accessories.


• | Frequent Replacement Cycle. The repetitive and predictable nature of customer behavior results in a significant volume of recurring revenue for the optical retail industry. The purchasing cycle of vision correction devices is closely tied to the frequency with which consumers obtain eye exams. Most optometrists recommend annual eye exams as a preventive measure against serious eye conditions and to help patients identify changes in their vision correction needs. According to The Vision Council, an estimated 192 million people in the United States using vision correction devices in 2017 received nearly 115 million eye exams that year, implying an average interval between exams of 20 months. The interval between exams contributes to the industry’s stability and shortening this interval represents an opportunity to increase the frequency of customer purchases.


• | Increased Usage of Computer and Mobile Screens. Due to the proliferation of smartphones, laptops, tablets and other electronic devices, the U.S. population has experienced a dramatic increase in the amount of time spent viewing electronic screens. According to The Vision Council, about 80% of American adults report using digital devices for more than two hours per day with approximately 70% using two or more devices simultaneously, and approximately 60% reporting experiencing symptoms of digital eye strain. This is anticipated to result in a larger percentage of the population suffering from screen-related vision problems, driving incremental sales of vision correction devices, such as traditional eyeglasses and contact lenses, as well as higher margin products designed specifically to counteract the effect of looking at screens for prolonged stretches of time.

• | Growing Focus on Health and Wellness. The optical retail industry is poised to continue to benefit from expansive trends underlying an increasing societal focus on health and wellness. Consumers want personalized solutions that allow them to make informed decisions about their health. Additionally, rising healthcare costs are driving a growing emphasis on preventative healthcare. Eye exams can detect a host of physical ailments, such as hypertension or diabetes, and are one of the most inexpensive and effective forms of detection for many of these conditions. As consumers continue to develop greater awareness of health and wellness issues, there is an opportunity for retailers that are able to offer personalized, inexpensive, health-oriented products and services that can increase quality of life and reduce an individual’s overall level of healthcare expenditures. Furthermore, this increased focus on health means that people are living longer, which increases the overall demand for vision care and the frequency with which people visit their eye care practitioners for vision care products and services.

Our Products and Services
Within our two reportable segments, we primarily offer two products and one service: eyeglasses, contact lenses and eye exams. Nonetheless, our diverse product portfolio encompasses many brand names and thousands of SKUs. Depending on the brand, our stores display approximately 600 to 1,935 eyeglass frame SKUs, covering all age groups. Offerings include both brand name designers, like Ray-Ban, Guess and Calvin Klein, as well as private label options at attractive prices. Our frames are manufactured by market leaders such as Luxottica, Marchon and Zyloware. Additionally, we partner with several overseas factories to direct source our private label products. We also offer a broad portfolio of lenses, including single vision and bifocal lenses, with a variety of treatments to enhance vision. Through one-on-one consultative-selling, our sales associates have a number of opportunities to share information about value-added lenses, including thinner, higher-quality lenses and photochromatic options, which carry higher margins. As a result, a significant number of America’s Best customers and Eyeglass World customers who purchase eyeglasses choose upgraded lenses and/or frames instead of each brand’s base offer. We also offer contact lenses and accessories from all major contact lens manufacturers, including our own private label brands (Softmed and Natural Eyes HydraWear, made by CooperVision) that are offered in our America’s Best and Eyeglass World stores. Collectively, our broad product offerings deliver consistent financial results and reduce our reliance on any individual product, style or trend.
In both of our reportable segments, eye exam services are provided by optometrists employed by us or by professional corporations owned by eye care practitioners with whom we have contractual arrangements or by independent optometrists with whom we have contracted.
Within our owned & host segment, America’s Best offers its Eyecare Club programs primarily to its contact lens customers. As of December 29, 2018, the Eyecare Club had approximately 1.4 million active members. Benefits of the Eyecare Club include two free eye exams per year for the duration of the multi-year membership, 10% off all contact lenses and eyeglasses and other periodic benefits and discounts, such as free samples of contact lens solutions. Memberships can be purchased in stores or on our America’s Best website. Two separate club memberships are available: the three-year Silver membership, which costs $99, and the five-year Gold membership, which costs $139. By comparison, the cost of a contact lens exam, exclusive of the Eyecare Club, is $89. There is a high adoption rate of Eyecare Club membership by America’s Best customers who are not part of a managed care program and who visited an America’s Best store for a contact lens examination. The disposable nature of contact lenses means that customers must replenish their contacts frequently, and in order to refill their prescriptions, contact lens users must have a current prescription. For a prescription to be current, customers generally need to have an eye exam every one or two years, depending on the state in which they reside. The multi­year nature of these memberships facilitates repeat traffic to America’s Best stores for exams and contact lens purchases and builds customer loyalty. The Eyecare Club also has attractive working capital characteristics, as customers pay the full membership cost at the time that they join. 
See Note 7. “Revenue from Contracts With Customers” in our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II. Item 8. of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Our Customers
Our customers need to see their best to perform their jobs, care for their families and contribute to their communities. Purchasing decisions are based on value, quality of service, fashion, location and eye health, among others. Based on a variety of third-party research studies, we have found that our customers typically prioritize value and convenience above other considerations. Value encompasses a combination of eye health with quality products and services, all offered at a fair price. Convenience encompasses multiple vectors: (i) retail locations near where our customers work and shop, with easy, convenient parking, (ii) store hours that fit their lifestyles, (iii) product selection that achieves aesthetic and/or fashion goals, (iv) availability of on-site eye exams and (v) acceptance of certain vision insurance benefits.

For our two owned brands, we have developed specific customer demographic profiles. More specifically, we estimate that our typical America’s Best customer has a household income between $35,000 to $100,000, is a high school graduate, holds a blue collar job and is between 35 to 64 years old, while our typical Eyeglass World customer is slightly more affluent, has a college degree or higher, holds a professional or technical job and is between 35 to 79 years old. These profiles demonstrate that, even within the same market, our America’s Best and Eyeglass World brands appeal to and attract a different consumer, which speaks favorably to our growth potential and our ability to open new stores of both brands in the same markets. 
Our Sales and Marketing
We developed our marketing strategy based on the in-depth knowledge we have of our customers. Our brands are positioned to stand for low prices and great value, which resonate with our target consumers and leave a lasting impression that is distinct from the competition.
We believe that television is a key channel for connecting with our customers. Approximately two-thirds of America’s Best and Eyeglass World’s advertising investments are on traffic-driving television advertisements, which we leverage broadly across multiple stores in each television market to gain a larger share of voice, and, in turn, drive traffic and margins. Additional advertising investments include digital media, search, direct mail, email and local store marketing. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we shifted our America’s Best television advertising from local campaigns to purchasing television advertising nationally, which we believe is more cost effective and helps raise our brand awareness in both existing and new markets.
For our host and legacy brands, we rely on our host and legacy partners’ marketing initiatives to drive traffic into their stores, and then we develop and execute highly targeted local marketing campaigns within stores to create awareness of our service and product offerings.
Our customer relationship management (“CRM”) system is used to collect customer demographic data. With this information and the third-party data that we use to supplement the customer information, we create targeted mailing lists (both direct mail and email) to send communications to our customers based on their vision needs and interests to help improve retention of our existing customers. In addition to our CRM program, digital advertising is a critical component of our media mix, as we believe both of these programs generate a high rate of return. Potential customers gain awareness of our brands through paid and organic digital efforts via content, video and social media that lead them to our websites.
Our Sourcing and Supplier Relationships
We purchase our merchandise from a wide variety of vendors, with a limited number of vendors supplying the majority of our eyeglass frames, eyeglass lenses and contact lenses. We are a large customer for all of our suppliers and we strive to form meaningful, long-lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with our vendors. We have long-term contracts with certain of our suppliers, including Essilor and CooperVision. Under our agreement with Essilor, Essilor has the sole and exclusive right to supply certain lenses for eyeglasses to us. We extended our agreement with Essilor in November 2018 and the current term runs through May 2023.  Thereafter, the agreement will automatically renew on a month-to-month basis unless either party gives 30 days’ prior written notice of termination, and we also have the ability to unilaterally extend the agreement an additional calendar quarter after the proposed termination date. We are collaborative in our vendor negotiations so as to develop a partnership with our vendors and, in time, a sense of loyalty to National Vision. Each of our top ten vendors has been with us for at least ten years, and several of these vendors have been with us since our inception in 1990. We focus on sourcing low-cost products, including discounted well-known frame brands, secondary frame brands, direct import frames and private label contact lenses under our Softmed and Natural Eyes HydraWear labels. By investing in our sourcing operations, we have increased our direct importation of eyeglass frames, which has enabled us to offer high quality frames at low prices while also generating strong gross margins.
11

Our Optical Laboratories
We use a highly-efficient mix of four domestic, company-operated processing facilities and two international, outsourced facilities. We have state-of-the-art lens processing capabilities in our four, geographically-diverse company-operated production facilities in Lawrenceville, Georgia, St. Cloud, Minnesota, Plano, Texas and Salt Lake City, Utah. Our centralized optical laboratories handle all aspects of customizing eyeglass lenses, and have digital capabilities for grinding, coating and edging to customer prescription and eyeglass frame specifications. We have developed a high-volume, low-cost lens processing model to provide seven-day turnaround service through our domestic owned laboratories and our international partner laboratories. This network was created through significant investment by us, and is leveraged across our portfolio of brands in both segments to provide efficiency and scale. We route eyeglass orders to both our owned and outsourced laboratories through an automated decision tree that incorporates information on (i) the nature of the job; (ii) the technical capabilities of each laboratory; (iii) the capacity of each laboratory; (iv) the inventory at each laboratory; and (v) the cost of that particular type of job at each laboratory. This architecture is integrated with the point-of-sale system and enables us to minimize our processing costs, while ensuring on-time deliveries. The processing system is designed such that the more eyeglasses we sell, the more efficient the laboratories become, creating significant cost savings over time. 
In addition, our Eyeglass World stores are equipped with on-site laboratories, which typically process less complicated customer orders with same-day service. On-site laboratories can process a variety of lens options. For fiscal year 2018, over half of Eyeglass World in-store customer orders were processed entirely in the store. All lens orders that are not processed or completed in-store are processed or completed by our centralized laboratory network.
Our Distribution Network
Our approximately 66,000 square foot distribution center in Lawrenceville, Georgia is located near our corporate offices in Duluth, Georgia. We utilize third-party carriers to transport all of our products from this distribution center to our stores.
Our approximately 52,000 square foot distribution center in Columbus, Ohio is located close to the headquarters of our AC Lens subsidiary. We utilize third-party carriers to transport our products from this distribution center directly to customers and to store locations for our partners.
We believe that the size and scalability of our distribution centers is more than sufficient to support our future expansion over the next four to five years.
Our Employees
As of December 29, 2018, we had 10,668 full-time and part-time employees.  In addition, the professional corporations with which we contract employed 978 optometrists as of December 29, 2018. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced a strike or work stoppage, and we believe that our relations with employees are excellent.
Managed Vision Care
Our managed care business relates to vision care programs and associated benefits (i) sponsored by employees or other groups, (ii) provided by insurers and managed care entities, such as health maintenance organizations to individuals, and (iii) delivered, typically on a fee-for-service or capitated basis, by health care providers, such as ophthalmologists, optometrists and opticians. We are currently underpenetrated in the managed care market relative to the broader optical retail industry, and we believe that this represents an important opportunity for us. Through our point-of-sale system and our back-office electronic data interchange, or EDI, capabilities, we attempt to create a seamless transactional experience for our in-store managed care customers. From time to time, vision care insurance payors may make changes to their EDI claim systems. Such changes may require us to update our processes and could impact our ability to submit claims or to timely receive reimbursements from our managed care partners. As such, when asked, we have assisted a number of our larger vision care insurance payors to either implement or improve their EDI claim systems. 
We monitor both industry and national healthcare changes and are well-positioned to take advantage of these changes due to our low-cost offerings and strong electronic infrastructure. We expect to continue to grow the managed care component of our business through our relationships and partnership initiatives with managed care payors.
Competition
The optical retail industry is highly competitive. Competition is generally based upon brand name recognition, price, convenience, selection, service and product quality.
12

We operate within the value segment of the U.S. optical retail industry, which emphasizes price and value. This segment is fragmented. We compete with mass merchants and warehouse club stores, specialty retail chains and independent eye care practitioners and opticians. In the broader optical retail industry, we also compete with large national retailers such as (in alphabetical order) LensCrafters, Pearle Vision and Visionworks. This competition takes place both in physical retail locations and online.
We also compete with online sellers of contact lenses and eyewear. The online sale of contact lenses has steadily increased in particular since the passage of the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act. See “Government Regulation” below. The online sale of eyeglasses has not developed as quickly, but a number of firms are focused on this market, including Warby Parker and Zenni Optical. We also face potential competition from companies that employ emerging technologies in the optical industry, including, for example, online vision exams and 3D printing of eyewear.
We also compete to be a provider under managed care contracts, which can provide us with access to new customers and also allow us to better serve our customers who are covered by managed care by filing claims directly with the payor and collecting only the applicable co-pay amount from these customers. Competition is based on many factors, including price and the density of the provider network. Several large managed care payors are vertically integrated, with substantial retail networks. We have, in the past, and may, in the future, experience heightened challenges to be admitted as a provider to these networks or to maintain our status in them.
Seasonality
Our business is moderately seasonal in nature. Historically, our business has realized a higher portion of revenue, operating income and cash flows from operations in the first fiscal quarter, and a lower portion of net revenue, operating income and cash flows from operations in the fourth fiscal quarter. The seasonally larger first quarter is attributable primarily to the timing of our customers’ income tax refunds and annual health insurance program start/reset periods. We believe that many customers in our target market, which consists of cost-conscious and low-income consumers, rely on tax refunds to pay for eyewear and eye care. A delay in the issuance of tax refunds can accordingly have a negative impact on our quarterly financial results. Consumers could also alter how they utilize tax refund proceeds.
With respect to our fourth quarter results, compared to other retailers, our products and services are less likely to be included in consumer’s holiday spending budgets, therefore reducing spending on personal vision correction during the weeks preceding December 25 of each year. Additionally, although the period between December 25 and the end of our fiscal year is typically a high-volume period, the net revenue associated with substantially all orders of prescription eyeglasses and contact lenses during that period is deferred until January due to our policy of recognizing revenue only after the product has been accepted by the customer, further contributing to higher first quarter results. Our quarterly results may also be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings, the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores, the timing of certain holidays, as well as the timing of weather-related store closures.
Information Technology
Information technology systems are critical to our day-to-day operations as well as to our long-term growth strategies. Our systems are designed to deliver a consistent, scalable, high-performing and secure experience for our customers and partners. We utilize a combination of co-location data center and cloud-based solutions for our infrastructure and the majority of our applications consist of standard, integrated software solutions. Our systems provide the data analysis and automation necessary to support our marketing, merchandising, inventory, distribution, store operations and point-of-sale, e-commerce, finance, accounting and human resources initiatives. We believe our current systems allow us to identify and respond to operating trends in our business.
Over time, we have modernized our point-of-sale system, upgraded multiple financial package components and are implementing software systems to enhance the growth of our omni-channel and customer engagement efforts. In addition, enhancing cybersecurity continues to be a priority and we have several initiatives underway that are intended to further advance our security posture. We believe these investments, along with maintenance of our existing information technology capabilities, will provide the flexibility and capacity to accommodate our future growth plans.

All trademarks, service marks and trade names appearing in this Form 10-K (or in documents we have incorporated by reference) are the property of their respective owners.
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations. Because of the various facets of our business, the scope and extent of laws and regulations applicable to our business are always subject to the risk of change or material increase. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations can subject us to sanctions (including suspension and loss of operating licenses), fines or various forms of civil or criminal prosecution, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors” below for a discussion of these and other risks. A summary of certain laws and regulations is described below.
Corporate Practice of Medicine/Optometry and Similar Laws
Many states prohibit the corporate practice of medicine/optometry where a business corporation practices medicine or employs a physician to provide professional medical services. Many states interpret the corporate practice of medicine/optometry rules broadly to prohibit employment of eye care practitioners by corporations like us and to prohibit various financial arrangements, such as fee-splitting, between eye care practitioners and other entities. A number of states that permit these relationships nevertheless regulate them extensively. For example, some states prohibit a common entrance to a retail optical location and an optometric office. These laws and regulations can vary significantly by state, requiring us to tailor our operations in each state to the particular laws of such state. Many of these laws and regulations are vague and are subject to the interpretation of regulators and enforcement authorities, which may change over time. States periodically revisit these laws and regulations and we are subject to the ongoing risk that the regulatory scheme in any state can change in ways adverse to us. Our America’s Best operations, which feature a bundled offer of eyeglasses and an eye examination, are particularly implicated by these laws. 
Professional Licensure and Regulation
Our operations are also subject to state licensing laws. All states license the practice of ophthalmology and optometry and many states license opticians. The dispensing of prescription eyewear is further regulated in most states in which we do business. In some states, we are also required to register our stores. 
Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act (“FCLCA”)
In connection with our sales of contact lens, we must comply with the FCLCA, and its implementing regulations, which establish a national uniform standard in the United States with regard to releasing and verifying contact lens prescriptions. This law also contains a “passive verification” requirement pursuant to which a prescription is deemed verified if a prescriber fails to respond within eight business hours to a request by a seller for confirmation of the accuracy of the prescription.

Managed Care Regulation 
We are engaged in managed vision care, both as a managed care entity and as a provider to managed care payors and insurers. In California, our subsidiary, FirstSight, a specialized health maintenance organization (“HMO”), is subject to the managed care laws of the State of California and is licensed and comprehensively regulated by the California Department of Managed Health Care (the “DMHC”). These regulations contain operating, disclosure, reporting and financial viability requirements, among others. Material changes to the operations of FirstSight, including the opening of America’s Best locations outside of defined service areas, must be approved by the DMHC. This approval process can be complex and can cause delays in the projected opening of our stores. We also offer Eyecare Club programs pursuant to which, in exchange for a fixed payment, individuals can obtain eye examinations and discounts on eyeglasses, contact lenses and accessories during the program period. These programs may be subject to regulation under managed care and related state laws, including those of California, where these programs are offered as managed care products by FirstSight. In addition, our Eyecare Club programs may subject us to state statutes regulating discount medical plans. These laws, which have been adopted in a number of states, require the licensing or registration of organizations that provide discounted access to health care providers. It is possible that state regulators could determine that we are operating as a discount medical plan and as such are subject to the various registration, disclosure and solvency requirements. 
Privacy and Security
We directly collect, use, access, disclose, transmit and/or store protected health information (“PHI”) and personally identifiable information (“PII”) in connection with the sales of our products and services, customer service, billing and employment practices. As a health care provider and as a business associate to health care providers, we are subject to federal and comparable state laws governing privacy and security, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and its implementing regulations, such as the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule and the Breach Notification Rule. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (the “HITECH Act”) extends the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule directly to business associates. We are also subject to comparable state health privacy laws to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than the Privacy Rule. Nearly all states have adopted their own data breach laws with comparable (and sometimes conflicting) standards and requirements. These state laws apply to breaches of specified elements of personal information. In addition, states may amend or adopt new laws or regulations regarding data privacy that may be applicable to us, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 which will go into effect in January 2020.
Laws Related to Reimbursement by Government Programs
Our participation in federal reimbursement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, subjects us to federal anti-kickback, false claims, self-referral and similar laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in exchange for, the referral of an individual or purchasing, furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payment of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have found a violation of the statute’s intent requirement if a single purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered businesses. There are also a number of healthcare fraud statutes that impose criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the Anti-Kickback Statute or healthcare fraud statutes, or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation. Many states have adopted similar laws that apply to any third-party payors including commercial plans. 
In addition, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute provides that any claim for government reimbursement in violation of the statute also violates the False Claims Act (“FCA”). The FCA prohibits intentionally submitting, conspiring to submit, or causing to be submitted, false or otherwise improper claims, records or statements to the federal government, or intentionally failing to return overpayments, in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs. Most states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the FCA, and both federal and state false claims laws permit private individuals to file qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government. The Social Security Act also imposes significant penalties for false or improper Medicare and Medicaid billings.

The U.S. Physician Self-Referral Law, or the Stark Law, generally prohibits physicians (which the Stark Law defines to also include optometrists) from referring, for certain services, Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries to any entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship. This law further prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral. Many states have adopted similar self-referral laws which are not limited to Medicare or Medicaid reimbursed services. In some cases, the rental of space constitutes a financial relationship under this law. 
Federal Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Regulation
The FDA generally has authority to, among other things, regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and labeling of medical devices, including contact and spectacle lenses. Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”), medical devices must meet a number of regulatory requirements. We engage in certain manufacturing, repackaging and relabeling activities at our optical laboratories and at certain Eyeglass World stores, which subject us to the FDA’s registration, listing and quality requirements. We are required to register our centralized laboratories with the FDA. 
Consumer Protection Laws
Federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations can apply to our operations and retail offers. Some of our promotions, such as our America’s Best offer of a “free” eye exam, are subject to compliance with laws and regulations governing use of this term. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”) to investigate and prosecute practices that are “unfair trade practices,” “deceptive trade practices,” or “unfair methods of competition.” State attorneys general typically have comparable authority and many states permit private plaintiffs to bring actions on the basis of these laws. In addition, state regulators or boards of optometry may challenge our promotional practices, including America’s Best’s bundled offers, as, among other things, violating applicable state laws regarding unfair competition or false advertising to consumers. 
E-commerce Laws
Our e-commerce business, operated by our subsidiary AC Lens, must comply with various federal and state laws, most notably the FCLCA, and its implementing regulation, the Contact Lens Rule, adopted by the FTC. This law and rule require that, before we sell contact lenses online, we verify the prescriptions we receive from our customers. A violation of the Contact Lens Rule constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the FTC Act. Our online business must also be registered in various states. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”)
We source a significant portion of our products from outside the United States. The FCPA and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or offering anything of value to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies and our code of conduct mandate compliance with applicable law, including these laws and regulations. 
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI Standard”)
Because we accept debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to the PCI Standard, which contains compliance guidelines with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of cardholder data. Certain states have incorporated these requirements into state law. Our credit card agreements with our banks require that we comply with this standard and pay for any fines and assessments imposed by the credit card companies in the event of a compromise of card data. 
Service Contract Regulations 
We offer product protection plans for our eyeglasses; in certain states, service contract and similar laws regulate these plans. These laws, which vary by state, mandate that sellers of such contracts comply with various registration, disclosure and financial requirements. It is possible that regulators in certain states could determine that our extended warranty plans should be subject to these laws. 
Environmental and Safety Regulation
Our optical laboratories in the United States and our in-store laboratories in our Eyeglass World locations subject us to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment, public health and employee safety, including, for example, regulations governing the management of hazardous substances, and the maintenance of safe working conditions. These laws also apply generally to all our properties. Our failure to comply with these laws can subject us to criminal and civil liabilities.
16

Insurance and Risk Management
We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for workers’ compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers’ liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health-care benefits, among others. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Where we have retained risk through self-insurance or similar arrangements, we utilize third-party firms to assist management in assessing the financial impact of risk retention.
