ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Alimera Sciences, Inc., and its subsidiaries (we or Alimera), is a pharmaceutical company that specializes in the commercialization and development of prescription ophthalmic pharmaceuticals. Alimera was incorporated on June 4, 2003 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We presently focus on diseases affecting the back of the eye, or retina, because we believe these diseases are not well treated with current therapies and represent a significant market opportunity.
Our only commercial product is ILUVIEN®, an intravitreal implant that treats patients by delivering a continuous microdose of the non-proprietary corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide (FAc) in the eye, for up to 36 months. “Intravitreal” refers to the space inside the eye behind the lens that contains the jelly-like substance called vitreous. ILUVIEN was initially developed to treat diabetic macular edema (DME). DME is a disease of the retina that affects individuals with diabetes and can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. ILUVIEN has received marketing authorization in the United States (U.S.), Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Lebanon, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. In the U.S., Canada, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates, ILUVIEN is indicated for the treatment of DME in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure (IOP). In the European Economic Area (EEA) countries in which ILUVIEN has received marketing authorization, it is indicated for the treatment of vision impairment associated with DME considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies. As part of the approval process in Europe, we committed to conduct a five-year, post-authorization, open label registry study in 800 patients treated with ILUVIEN. Due to our post market safety surveillance not showing any unexpected safety signals, we requested and received approval to modify our protocol to cap enrollment in the study. Enrollment was completed with 562 patients. We anticipate this study to be completed in early 2020.
We commercially market ILUVIEN in the U.S., Germany, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Austria and Ireland.
In addition, we have entered into various agreements under which distributors are providing or will provide regulatory, reimbursement or sales and marketing support for ILUVIEN in France, Italy, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several countries in the Middle East. In 2016, our Middle East distributor launched ILUVIEN and initiated named patient sales in the United Arab Emirates. “Named patient sales” refers to the ability of a retinal specialist to prescribe ILUVIEN because the patient has a special need for a drug that lacks a general market authorization. Our Italian distributor launched ILUVIEN in Italy in 2017. Our Spanish distributor began selling on a named patient basis in 2017 and after receiving reimbursement in 2018, plans a full-scale launch in 2019. Our French and Canadian distributors are currently pursuing reimbursement in their respective countries. As of December 31, 2018, we have recognized revenue from sales of ILUVIEN to the Company’s international distributors in the Middle East, France, Italy and Spain.
In December 2017, we filed an application for a new indication for ILUVIEN for the treatment of non-infectious posterior uveitis (NIPU) in the 17 EEA countries where ILUVIEN is currently approved for the treatment of DME. Uveitis is an inflammatory disease of the uveal tract, which is comprised of the iris, ciliary body and choroid, that can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. In 2018, the regulatory authorities requested additional follow-up data from the clinical trials to support the application. We submitted this additional follow-up data in October 2018. We expect to obtain approval of our application for NIPU in the first half of 2019, although we can provide no assurances that we can do so.
ILUVIEN is inserted into the back of the patient’s eye in a non-surgical procedure employing a device with a 25-gauge needle, which allows for a self-sealing wound. We believe that corticosteroids provide the best option in the treatment of DME and NIPU because they reduce the inflammatory aspects of the disease. Further, we believe that ILUVIEN’s CONTINUOUS MICRODOSING™ delivery makes it the only approved drug therapy for DME that can deliver consistent daily therapeutic levels of corticosteroid. The delivery mechanism of ILUVIEN provides lower daily and aggregate exposure to corticosteroids than any other intraocular dosage forms currently available, which we believe mitigates the typical risks associated with corticosteroid therapy. Further, ILUVIEN, which is non-bioerodible, provides consistent delivery as a result of its constant surface area. This provides a sustained therapeutic effect on DME and NIPU. Other therapies that physicians currently use to treat DME, such as anti-VEGF treatments and other corticosteroids, are acute (short-acting) therapies that provide a higher initial daily dose but then rapidly decline, requiring frequent reinjection by the physician to maintain or reestablish the therapeutic effect.
Our strategy is to establish ILUVIEN as a leading therapy for DME patients and subsequently for other indications for which ILUVIEN is proven safe and effective because of its ability to treat retinal diseases consistently and continuously every day for up to three years. We intend to capitalize on our management’s experience, the breadth of our commercial resources in both the U.S. and Europe, and our marketing expertise to commercialize ILUVIEN. We intend to use those same strengths to acquire, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize other potential eye care products.

Business Strategy
We presently focus on diseases affecting the back of the eye, or retina, because we believe these diseases are not well treated with current therapies and represent a significant market opportunity. Our business strategy is to:

• | Maximize the Commercial Success of ILUVIEN. We commercially market ILUVIEN directly in the U.S., Germany, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Austria and Ireland. We began selling ILUVIEN in Austria in the first quarter of 2017 and in Ireland in the fourth quarter of 2017. We have approval in 12 additional countries in the EEA and we are pursuing opportunities to sell ILUVIEN in some of these countries. Our Italian distributor launched ILUVIEN in Italy in 2017. Our Spanish distributor began selling on a named patient basis in 2017, with plans for a formal launch in 2019. Our French distributor is currently pursuing reimbursement at the national level. In addition, outside the EEA, we have established distribution relationships in Canada and the Middle East. Our distributor in the Middle East began selling ILUVIEN in the United Arab Emirates in 2016, and has plans to begin selling on a named patient basis in several other Middle Eastern countries in 2019. Our distributor in Canada received regulatory approval in 2018 and is currently pursuing reimbursement with plans to sell on a named patient basis beginning in mid-2019.


• | Obtain approval for ILUVIEN for NIPU. We filed an application for a new indication for ILUVIEN for the treatment of NIPU in the 17 EEA countries where ILUVIEN is currently approved for the treatment of DME. We will evaluate seeking approval for the treatment of NIPU in other countries in the Middle East and Africa where we have the license to use ILUVIEN.


• | Pursue Approval for ILUVIEN for DME in Additional Countries. We plan to pursue regulatory approval for ILUVIEN for the treatment of DME, directly or with a partner, in other countries. We have entered into an agreement to distribute ILUVIEN in Australia and New Zealand. Pursuant to this agreement, our distributor has filed for approval in those countries. In addition, under a Mutual Recognition Procedure (MRP) available in the EEA, we can submit ILUVIEN for approval in any or all of the remaining 12 European Union (EU) countries where we do not have marketing approval.


• | Assess the Effectiveness of ILUVIEN for Additional Retinal Diseases. We believe that ILUVIEN has the potential to address additional retinal diseases other than DME and NIPU, including Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and wet AMD.


• | Expand Our Ophthalmic Product Pipeline. We believe there are further unmet medical needs in the treatment of ophthalmic diseases. We intend to continue to evaluate in-licensing and acquisition opportunities for compounds and technologies with potential treatment applications for diseases affecting the eye.

Disease Overview and Market Opportunity
Diabetes and Diabetic Retinopathy
Diabetes mellitus, with its systemic and ophthalmic complications, represents a global public health threat. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated prevalence of diabetes worldwide in 2017 increased to 425 million people and is expected to increase to 629 million people by 2045.
The 2017 National Diabetes Statistics Reports published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that as of 2015, 30.3 million Americans, or 9.4% of the U.S. population, have diabetes and that there were 1.5 million new cases of diabetes diagnosed among people ages 18 and older. Nearly 1 in 4 four adults living with diabetes, 7.2 million Americans, did not know they had the condition and are therefore not being monitored and treated to control their disease and prevent systemic and ophthalmic complications. The report also identified that around 84.1 million people have prediabetes, a condition that if not treated often leads to type 2 diabetes within five years. In this population, only 11.6% of adults know they had prediabetes. The IDF estimates that there are approximately 58.0 million people in Europe with diabetes and that 22.0 million remain undiagnosed. In the Middle East, it is estimated there are approximately 23.0 million people with diabetes and 10.0 million remain undiagnosed.
All patients with diabetes are at risk of developing some form of diabetic retinopathy, an ophthalmic complication of diabetes with symptoms including the swelling and leakage of blood vessels within the retina or the abnormal growth of new blood vessels on the surface of the retina. According to the CDC Vision Health Initiative, diabetic retinopathy causes approximately 12,000 to 24,000 new cases of blindness in the U.S. each year; making diabetes the leading cause of new cases of blindness in adults aged 20 to 74. Diabetic retinopathy can be divided into either non-proliferative or proliferative retinopathy. Non-proliferative retinopathy develops first and causes increased capillary permeability, micro aneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates (when fluid leaks into spaces between vessels), macular ischemia (lack of oxygen) and macular edema 
6

(thickening of the retina caused by fluid leakage from capillaries). Proliferative retinopathy is an advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy that, in addition to characteristics of non-proliferative retinopathy, results in the growth of new blood vessels. These new blood vessels are abnormal and fragile, growing along the retina and along the surface of the clear, vitreous gel that fills the inside of the eye. By themselves, these blood vessels do not cause symptoms or vision loss. However, these blood vessels have thin, fragile walls that are prone to leakage and hemorrhage.
Diabetic Macular Edema
When the blood vessel leakage of diabetic retinopathy leads to the build-up of fluid, or edema, in a region of the retina called the macula, the condition is called DME. This area of the eye is important for the sharp, straight-ahead vision that is used for reading, recognizing faces, and driving. There are an estimated 750,000 people with DME in the U.S., according to the National Eye Institute. DME is the most common cause of vision loss among people with diabetic retinopathy and about 30% of people with diabetic retinopathy will develop DME. It is more likely to occur as diabetic retinopathy worsens, although it may occur at any stage of the disease. The onset of DME is painless and may go undetected by the patient until it manifests with the blurring of central vision or acute vision loss. The severity of this blurring may range from mild to profound loss of vision. 
Studies have shown that DME is a multifactorial disease that is underpinned by inflammatory cytokine activity in the eye. Of the currently approved pharmacotherapies used to treat DME, only corticosteroids, including fluocinolone acetonide found in the ILUVIEN implant, affect these cytokines.
As the incidence of diabetes continues to increase worldwide, the incidence of DME and other complications is predicted to rise as well. Most patients who suffer from diabetes do not meet glycemic (glucose or blood sugar) targets, resulting in hyperglycemia (elevated levels of glucose in the blood). This, in turn, leads to the development of micro-vascular complications, which manifest in the eye as diabetic retinopathy, as well as elevated cytokines that break down the blood-retina barrier, leading to macular edema (DME) in many diabetic retinopathy patients. 
Uveitis
Uveitis means inflammation of the uvea track, which is a layer of tissue located between the outer layer (cornea and sclera) and the inner layer (the retina) of the eye. The front portion (anterior) of the uveal tract contains the iris, and the back portion (posterior) of the uveal tract contains the choroid and the stroma of the ciliary body. Inflammation of the uvea encompasses approximately 30 inflammatory disorders characterized by intraocular inflammation, a major cause of visual loss in people of working age in both developed and developing countries. It can affect people of all ages, producing swelling and destroying eye tissues, which can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. According to the classification scheme recommended by the International Uveitis Study Group, the disease can be classified on the basis of anatomic locations: anterior, intermediate, posterior or pan uveitis. Uveitis can be caused by a number of factors such as infection (infectious uveitis) or other autoimmune diseases or conditions. Posterior uveitis is a persistent and recurrent disease that also commonly affects the retina. Additionally, it commonly affects vision, more so than anterior uveitis, and macular edema is the most common mechanism of visual loss, affecting 44% patients with posterior uveitis.
There are two forms of uveitis:

• | infectious uveitis (bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic), which is treated with an appropriate antimicrobial drug as well as corticosteroids and cycloplegics; and


• | NIPU, where corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation and prevent adhesions in the eye.

Current Treatments for DME
Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies are the current standard of care for the treatment of DME. Lucentis (ranibizumab) and Eylea (aflibercept) are the only approved anti-VEGF therapies marketed for the treatment of vision loss associated with DME in the EEA and for the treatment of DME in the U.S. Off-label injections of the anti-VEGF therapy Avastin (bevacizumab) are also used to treat DME. However, anti-VEGF therapies are acute therapies and are limited by a need for multiple and frequent injections to achieve the same therapeutic effect reported in randomized controlled trials. Further, DME is a multi-factorial disease and anti-VEGF therapy does not address all of these factors. As a result, many patients either do not achieve a sufficient response or are unable to routinely attend clinic appointments, meaning that anti-VEGF therapy is not optimally administered. When not optimally administered, these acute therapies allow for a recurrence of the edema. In addition, these therapies have safety profiles that include an increased risk of endophthalmitis, a serious eye infection that must be treated with high doses of antibiotics. This risk of endophthalmitis is associated with any intravitreal injection. There is evidence that intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy affects systemic VEGF levels, which may have cardiovascular complications.
7

Intravitreal corticosteroid therapies are also used to treat DME. Acute corticosteroids typically have peak effects within three months, and there is a need for repeated injections. Similarly, without optimized treatment frequency, macular edema is allowed to recur when the effect of acute corticosteroids dissipates. Ozurdex (dexamethasone), a short-acting corticosteroid, is marketed for the treatment of vision loss associated with DME in the EEA and for the treatment of DME in the U.S. Triamcinolone acetonide is another short-acting steroid used off-label to treat DME. In contrast to the dexamethasone implant and triamcinolone acetonide, which are both acute therapies, ILUVIEN is a long-term persistent and continuous steroid delivery therapy. The steroid in the ILUVIEN implant, fluocinolone acetonide, or FAc, is a key component that allows a single implant to deliver a sustained daily dose for up to 36 months as discussed in more detail below. Corticosteroids have historically been associated with significant increases in IOP, which may increase the risk of glaucoma. Additionally, corticosteroids are associated with the acceleration of cataract formation. We believe the low dose of ILUVIEN mitigates these side effects and makes them more manageable. Additionally, the side effects of ILUVIEN are consistent with and predictable following the use of shorter duration or acute corticosteroid therapies, increasing the physician’s ability to manage those side effects. 
Laser photocoagulation is a retinal procedure in which a laser is used to apply a burn, or a pattern of burns, to cauterize leaky blood vessels to reduce edema. Visual acuity gains are less frequently seen with this therapy, as it is used to prevent or slow the loss of vision. Further, this destructive procedure has undesirable side effects including partial loss of peripheral and night vision. 
Current Treatments for NIPU
The treatment of uveitis varies according to the type of uveitis. The inflammation in non-infectious posterior uveitis or NIPU is at the back of the eye, and drops do not effectively reach the affected area. This means that treatment of NIPU uveitis focuses on (a) the localized delivery of therapies, usually a steroid, or (b) systemic therapy, administered in a tablet form or via injection. Systemic therapies very often lead to side effects that impact the whole body, unlike eye drops and injections into the eye.
Patients with NIPU are initially treated with systemic steroids, which are very effective, but when used at high doses for extended periods can lead to serious side effects. These side effects include acne, weight gain, sleep and mood disorders, hypertension and osteoporosis, which can limit the sustained use of systemic steroids. Patients then often progress to steroid-sparing therapies with systemic immune suppressants or biologics, which themselves can have severe side effects, including an increased risk of cancer and infections. In addition, periocular or intraocular steroids may be used to try to locally control inflammation in NIPU.
One problem for patients and clinicians is that recurrence of NIPU is very common. In chronic NIPU, recurrence often occurs within six months of withholding treatment, and patients and clinicians are forced to go through cycles of treatment initiation and cessation with the accompanying complexity of managing several drug classes, and their side effects, at once.
For patients with recurrent NIPU, locally delivered (intravitreal) steroids present an attractive treatment strategy allowing for effective delivery of steroid therapy at the point of need, while minimizing the risk of systemic side effects. For intravitreal treatment, the short-acting Ozurdex implant is marketed in the EEA for the treatment of adult patients with inflammation of the posterior segment of the eye presenting as non-infectious uveitis and for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis. ILUVIEN has been shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce the recurrence of NIPU, while at the same time reducing the need for adjunctive treatments, including systemic drug treatment. In January 2018 we announced we had submitted a Type II variation to our license in the EEA to add the indication of “recurrent and persistent non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment” across all registered markets in the EEA, as discussed in more detail below in “Uveitis.” 
In addition to corticosteroids, other therapies may be used to treat NIPU, including immunosuppressive drugs and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.

ILUVIEN
Overview
Our only commercial product is ILUVIEN, a sustained release corticosteroid intravitreal implant. ILUVIEN consists of a tiny non-bioerodible polyimide tube with a permeable membrane cap on one end and an impermeable silicone cap on the other end that is filled with 190 micrograms of FAc in a polyvinyl alcohol matrix. Both polyimide and the polyvinyl alcohol matrix have been demonstrated to be biocompatible with ocular tissues and have histories of safe use within the eye. ILUVIEN, which is non-bioerodible, provides consistent delivery as a result of its constant surface area which allows it to deliver a continuous microdose of FAc up to 36 months. ILUVIEN is inserted in the back of the patient’s eye in a non-surgical procedure using a sterile preloaded applicator (the ILUVIEN applicator) employing a 25-gauge needle, which allows for a self-sealing wound. This procedure is similar to that commonly employed by retinal specialists in the administration of other intravitreal therapies and commonly used in clinical practice.
ILUVIEN delivers continuous daily sub-microgram levels of FAc in both in vitro and in vivo release kinetic studies for up to 36 months, making it the only single injection therapy available to treat the retina consistently every day for up to three years, while reducing the recurrence of edema. The delivery mechanism of ILUVIEN provides lower daily and aggregate exposure to corticosteroids than any other intraocular dosage forms currently available for DME in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we have approval, which we believe mitigates the typical risks associated with corticosteroid therapy. Additionally, the side effects of ILUVIEN are consistent with and predictable following the use of shorter duration or acute corticosteroid therapies, increasing the physician’s ability to manage those side effects.
ILUVIEN has received marketing authorization in the U.S., Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Lebanon, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. In the U.S., Canada, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates, ILUVIEN is indicated for the treatment of DME in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in IOP. In the EEA countries in which ILUVIEN has received marketing authorization, ILUVIEN is indicated for the treatment of vision impairment associated with DME considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies.
The ILUVIEN technology has also demonstrated a therapeutic effect in the treatment of NIPU in two phase 3 trials. In December 2017, we filed an application for a new indication for ILUVIEN for the treatment of NIPU in the 17 EEA countries where ILUVIEN is currently approved for the treatment of DME. In mid 2018, the regulatory authorities requested additional follow-up data from the clinical trials to support the application. We submitted this additional follow-up data in October 2018. We expect that we will obtain approval of our application for NIPU in the first half of 2019, although we can provide no assurances that we can do so. In addition, if we receive approval of ILUVIEN for NIPU, it is likely that we will be required to conduct certain post-market activities to maintain the approval. These required activities could include a post-market safety or efficacy study of ILUVIEN in patients treated with ILUVIEN for NIPU. We will also be required to conduct a study assessing ILUVIEN in pediatric patients with NIPU that have been treated with ILUVIEN.
Fluocinolone Acetonide (FAc)
FAc, a non-proprietary corticosteroid, is the active compound in ILUVIEN and a member of the class of steroids known as corticosteroids. Corticosteroids have demonstrated a range of pharmacological actions, including inhibition of inflammation, inhibition of leukostasis, up regulation of occludin, inhibition of the release of certain inflammatory cytokines and suppression of VEGF secretion. Leukostasis refers to the accumulation of white blood cells at a particular site, which leads to further tissue damage. Occludin is an important protein in maintaining and reinforcing the tight junctions between cells. These pharmacological actions have the potential to treat various ocular conditions, including DME, NIPU, NPDR, RVO, dry AMD and wet AMD. However, FAc shares many of the same “class effect” side effects seen with other corticosteroids that are currently available for intraocular use. The two main side effects of using corticosteroids to treat ocular conditions are (a) increased IOP, which may increase the risk of glaucoma, and (b) the acceleration of cataract formation. FAc is uniquely lipophilic, making it very effective at penetrating retina tissue, and allowing it to achieve a therapeutic effect at a very low dose, typically lower than other corticosteroids.

ILUVIEN for Other Diseases of the Eye
Although we are not actively conducting clinical trials, we believe that ILUVIEN has the potential to address other ophthalmic diseases such as RVO, NPDR, dry AMD and wet AMD. Details regarding the rationale for these other indications are as follows:

• | Macular edema associated with RVO. According to GlobalData, a provider of global business intelligence, 16 million adults are affected by RVO around the world. In September 2009, Allergan, Inc. introduced Ozurdex (a short duration corticosteroid) as the first approved product for macular edema following RVO. The FDA approval of Ozurdex provides evidence that corticosteroids work effectively to treat RVO.


• | Moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). NPDR is the most at-risk stage of diabetic retinopathy for risk of progression to PDR. Prevention of progression to PDR is clinically important, as the risks of severe vision loss, blindness and retinal detachment increase when diabetic retinopathy progresses from NPDR to PDR. A recent paper published by Charles C. Wykoff in the Journal of Ophthalmology reported that treatment of DME patients with ILUVIEN over a 36-month period, slowed both the development of PDR and the progression of diabetic retinopathy.


• | Dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Dry AMD patients account for 90% of AMD patients, with the greatest unmet need among these patients being a treatment for geographic atrophy for which there are currently no treatments available. Pre-clinical studies in two established rat models of retinal degeneration reported at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology meetings in 2006, 2007 and 2008 described the efficacious effects of a miniaturized version of ILUVIEN in retinal degeneration. While there are no standard preclinical models of geographic atrophy, we believe these results support the exploration of ILUVIEN to treat this condition.


• | Wet AMD. The size of the wet AMD market was $2 billion in 2008 according to VisionGain, an independent competitive intelligence organization. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, more than 11 million people in America are affected by AMD and are now benefiting from advanced treatment options such as anti-VEGF agents and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Anti-VEGF antibodies require persistent dosing to maintain a therapeutic effect, which is a burden on both the patient and the physician. Estimates as of March 2015 of the global cost of visual impairment due to AMD is $343 billion, including $255 billion in direct health care costs according to BrightFocus Foundation. We believe ILUVIEN has the potential to complement the market leading anti-VEGF antibody therapies in the treatment of wet AMD, given that corticosteroids, including FAc, have been shown to suppress the production of VEGF.

ILUVIEN Regulatory Status
Diabetic Macular Edema
ILUVIEN has received marketing authorization in the U.S., Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Lebanon, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. In the U.S., Canada, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates, ILUVIEN is indicated for the treatment of DME in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in IOP. In the EEA countries in which ILUVIEN has received marketing authorization, it is indicated for the treatment of vision impairment associated with DME considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies. As part of the approval process in Europe, we committed to conduct a five-year, post-authorization, open label registry study in 800 patients treated with ILUVIEN. Due to our post market safety surveillance not showing any unexpected safety signals, we requested and received approval to modify our protocol to cap enrollment in the study. Enrollment was completed with 562 patients. We anticipate this study to be completed in early 2020.
We or our distributors are currently pursuing regulatory approval in certain Middle East countries, Australia and New Zealand.
Uveitis
We do not currently have a regulatory license for ILUVIEN to treat uveitis in the EEA or the U.S., and we do not have the right to pursue approval in the U.S. In January 2018, we announced that we had applied for a Type II variation to our license for the indication of “recurrent and persistent non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment” across all registered markets in the EEA. This submission is based on the positive results of two phase 3 trials conducted by EyePoint to assess the safety and efficacy of an equivalent of the ILUVIEN insert for the treatment of posterior uveitis. These studies are 
10

randomized, sham injection-controlled, double-masked trials. The primary endpoint for both trials was the rate of recurrence of posterior uveitis during six months, with patients being evaluated for up to three years. The first Phase 3 trial enrolled 129 patients in 16 centers in the U.S. and 17 centers outside the U.S. and achieved its primary efficacy endpoint. Likewise, the second trial enrolled 153 patients in 15 centers in India and also met its primary endpoint. We received formal acceptance of our Type II variation submission for ILUVIEN, which was submitted through the Mutual Recognition Procedure to the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The United Kingdom is the Reference Member State, which is the country that prepares an assessment report on the medicinal product and then shares the report with the other countries in the EEA in which the applicant has applied for a marketing authorization. The submission to the MHRA and 16 additional European states seeks to add the indication of recurrent and persistent NIPU to the ILUVIEN label in Europe. All 17 regulatory bodies have accepted the submission, which is currently under review. We expect to obtain approval of our application for NIPU in the first half of 2019, although we can provide no assurance that we can do so.
Commercialization
ILUVIEN is the only intraocular therapy to treat DME designed to deliver a continuous microdose of FAc for up to 36 months, enabling the physician to treat DME consistently and continuously every day with a single dose. Our commercialization strategy is to establish ILUVIEN as a leading therapy for the treatment of DME and subsequently for other indications for which ILUVIEN may prove safe and effective. We commercially market ILUVIEN in the U.S., Germany, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Austria and Ireland. We began selling ILUVIEN in Austria and Ireland in 2017. Our Italian distributor launched ILUVIEN in Italy in 2017. Our Spanish distributor began selling ILUVIEN on a named patient basis in 2017, and after receiving reimbursement, plans a formal launch in early 2019. We also plan to commercialize ILUVIEN, directly or with a partner, in other EEA and non-EEA countries pending the receipt of reimbursement and future applicable regulatory approvals. Although we anticipate that ILUVIEN will be administered as a standalone therapy, it is possible that ILUVIEN will be used in conjunction with other therapies. Our commercialization strategy in any jurisdiction is subject to and depends upon the approval of ILUVIEN by the applicable regulatory authorities.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales personnel focus on physician offices, pharmacies and hospitals in the U.S. and in European countries where we seek to persuade end users to purchase ILUVIEN. 
We have various agreements under which distributors are providing or will provide regulatory, reimbursement or sales and marketing support for commercialization of ILUVIEN in Italy, Spain, France, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and in several countries in the Middle East. Pursuant to these agreements, our distributors assisted or will assist us in obtaining approval or reimbursement, or they will seek approval or reimbursement with our oversight in those countries, if such approval or reimbursement has not already been obtained.
We develop our medical marketing, promotion and communication materials with the goal of ensuring that influential retinal specialists are presenting our data from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that supported our approval in the U.S. and Europe (the FAME studies), clinicians’ real world data, including our most recent post-market study in the U.S. (the USER study), and messages at key meetings in the U.S. and the EEA.
Manufacturing
We do not have an in-house manufacturing capability for our products. As a result, we depend and expect to continue to depend exclusively on third-party contract manufacturers to produce and package ILUVIEN. We manage the quality of our product produced by these manufacturers through quality agreements and our quality system to ensure that they produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and finished drug products in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain agreements with potential and existing manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to ILUVIEN.
Third party manufacturers are responsible for the commercial-scale production of ILUVIEN and the ILUVIEN applicator. We have agreements with a single third-party manufacturer for each of: 

• | the manufacture of the ILUVIEN implant and final assembly and packaging of ILUVIEN (Alliance Medical Products Inc., a Siegfried Company (Alliance))


• | the manufacturer of the components of the ILUVIEN applicator (FlexMedical or an affiliate of Flextronics International, Ltd. (Flextronics))


• | the manufacture of ILUVIEN’s active pharmaceutical ingredient (FARMABIOS SpA/Byron Chemical Company Inc.) and

11


• | the quality release testing of ILUVIEN in the EEA including the United Kingdom, post Brexit (AndersonBrecon Limited trading as Packaging Coordinators, Inc.).

Although we may seek alternative providers in the future, we do not currently have alternate providers for any of these activities. The manufacturing process for ILUVIEN consists of filling the polyimide tube with a paste consisting of 190 micrograms of FAc in an aqueous slurry of polyvinyl alcohol, cutting the tubes, capping the tubes with a permeable membrane cap on one end and an impermeable silicone cap on the other end, curing at high temperature, loading ILUVIEN inside the ILUVIEN applicator, packaging and sterilizing the product. This process has been validated at Alliance.
Under our agreement with Alliance, which we entered into in 2010 and amended and restated in 2016, we are responsible for supplying Alliance with the ILUVIEN applicator and the API. We purchased certain equipment at Alliance’s facility that Alliance uses solely to manufacture and package ILUVIEN for us. We have agreed to order from Alliance at least 80% of our total requirements for new units of ILUVIEN in the U.S., Canada and Europe in a calendar year, provided that Alliance is able to fulfill our supply requirements and is not in breach of its agreements or obligations to us. Currently, we order 100% of our global requirements for ILUVIEN units from Alliance because we do not have an alternate supplier. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its provisions, the amended and restated agreement has a remaining term through February 2021 and will automatically renew for successive terms of one year unless either party delivers written notice of non-renewal to the other at least 12 months before the end of the then current term. 
Under our agreement with Flextronics, which we entered into in 2012, Flextronics agreed to manufacture the components of the ILUVIEN applicator for us at its facility located near Tijuana, Mexico. We purchased certain equipment for Flextronics’ facility that Flextronics uses solely to manufacture the components of the ILUVIEN applicator for us. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the agreement, our agreement with Flextronics automatically renews for successive terms of one year unless either party delivers written notice of non-renewal to the other at least 18 months prior to the end of the then current term.
Business Segments
Our business has three segments: U.S., International and Other. Financial information about our business segments can be found in this annual report on Form 10-K in (a) Part I, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Segment Review” and (b) Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Customers
Our revenues for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were generated from product sales primarily in the U.S., Germany and the United Kingdom. In the U.S., two large pharmaceutical distributors accounted for 69% and 73% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These distributors maintain inventories of ILUVIEN and sell to physician offices, pharmacies and hospitals. Internationally, in countries where we sell direct, our customers are hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. We sometimes refer to physician offices, pharmacies, hospitals and clinics as end users. In international countries where we sell to distributors, these distributors maintain inventory levels of ILUVIEN and sell to their customers.
Competition
The development and commercialization of new drugs and drug delivery technologies is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to ILUVIEN and any products or product candidates we may develop or commercialize in the future from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide, many of whom have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. 
In the countries in which ILUVIEN has received or been recommended for marketing authorization or becomes approved for use in the treatment of DME, it competes or will compete against the use of anti-VEGF therapies, short duration corticosteroids and laser photocoagulation or other therapies that may be approved in the future. Other companies are working to develop other drug therapies and sustained delivery platforms for DME and other indications. These competitive therapies may result in pricing pressure even if ILUVIEN is otherwise viewed as a preferable therapy. We believe that the following drugs and treatments provide competition to ILUVIEN:

• | Lucentis© (ranibizumab injection), marketed by Genentech (Roche) in the U.S. and Novartis in the rest of the world and Avastin (bevacizumab), an oncology product marketed by the Roche group, are both antibodies that inhibit VEGF signaling pathways. Lucentis is currently approved for the treatment of DME, the treatment of diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME, the treatment of neovascular wet AMD and the treatment of macular

12

edema following RVO in the U.S. In the EEA, the indications are similar except for the indication to treat diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME. 

• | Avastin©, is used by retinal specialists in both the U.S. and in certain countries of the EEA in the treatment of numerous retinal diseases off label but is not formulated or approved for any ophthalmic use.


• | Eylea© (aflibercept), marketed by Regeneron in the U.S. and by Bayer in the EEA, is a VEGF antagonist that is approved for the treatment of DME, diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME, neovascular wet AMD and RVO in the U.S. In the EEA, the indication does not include diabetic retinopathy.


• | Ozurdex© (dexamethasone intravitreal implant), marketed by Allergan, is a short duration biodegradable implant that delivers the corticosteroid dexamethasone. Ozurdex is approved for the treatment of DME, macular edema following branch or central RVO and non-infectious uveitis in the U.S. In the EEA, the indication for DME is for visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema in persons who are pseudophakic (persons who have had an artificial lens implanted after the natural eye lens has been removed) or who are considered insufficiently responsive to, or unsuitable for non-corticosteroid therapy. It is also indicated for macular edema following either Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) or Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) and inflammation of the posterior segment of the eye presenting as non-infectious uveitis.


• | Humira© (adlimumab), marketed by Abbvie, is a TNF-blocker that has an ophthalmic indication. It works by targeting and blocking a specific source of inflammation that plays a role in non-infectious uveitis. In the U.S., Humira is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis. In the EEA, Humira is indicated for the treatment of chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in children aged two years or older who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy.


• | YUTIQ™ (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant) 180 micrograms, for intravitreal injection, marketed by Eyepoint, is a non-bioerodible intravitreal micro-insert that contains 180 micrograms of FAc that is designed to release .25 micrograms/day over the course of 36 months. YUTIQ is indicated for the treatment of chronic NIPU, in the U.S. It is not approved for any indication in Europe and EyePoint does not have the right to pursue any approval in Europe, where we are currently pursuing the approval of ILUVIEN for NIPU. YUTIQ is very similar to ILUVIEN, although the amount of FAc in the YUTIQ implant is slightly less and it utilizes a different injector. The two drugs are approved for different indications in the U.S., with ILUVIEN being approved for the treatment of DME and YUTIQ being approved for the treatment of chronic NIPU.


• | Intravitreal triamcinolone is used by some physicians for the treatment of DME although it is not approved for DME.


• | Laser photocoagulation is currently used to treat DME and may be used in conjunction with drug therapies as well. Other laser or surgical treatments for DME may also compete against ILUVIEN.

In addition, a number of other companies, including Alcon/ Novartis, Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Aerpio, Aerie, Allegro, and Clearside are developing drug therapies or sustained delivery platforms for the treatment of retinal diseases. Specifically, Alcon/ Novartis is developing Brolucizumab, a VEGF-targeted single-chain antibody fragment in development for retinal diseases including DME.
We believe we will be less likely to face a generic competitor for ILUVIEN for the treatment of DME because of the bioequivalency requirements of a generic form of ILUVIEN. A generic pharmaceutical competitor to ILUVIEN would need to establish bioequivalency through the demonstration of an equivalent pharmacodynamic endpoint in a clinical trial. We believe conducting such a clinical trial would be cost-prohibitive and time-consuming, although we cannot provide any assurances in that regard.
The licensing and acquisition of pharmaceutical products, which is part of our strategy, is a highly competitive area. A number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire products. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to, among other factors, their size, cash flow and institutional experience.
The active pharmaceutical ingredient in ILUVIEN is FAc, which is not patent protected. As a result, our competitors could develop an alternative formulation or delivery mechanisms to treat diseases of the eye with FAc. For a description of our license of proprietary insert technology for ILUVIEN, see the section immediately below.

Licenses and Agreements
EyePoint Pharmaceuticals US, Inc.
In 2005, we entered into an agreement with EyePoint Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (EyePoint), formerly known as pSivida US, Inc., for the use of FAc in EyePoint’s proprietary insert technology. In July 2017, we amended and restated the EyePoint agreement in the Second Amended and Restated Collaboration Agreement (New Collaboration Agreement). The New Collaboration Agreement provides us with a license to utilize certain underlying technology used in the development and commercialization of ILUVIEN. Before entering into the New Collaboration Agreement, we held a worldwide license from EyePoint for the use of steroids, including FAc, in EyePoint’s proprietary insert technology for the treatment of all ocular diseases other than uveitis. The New Collaboration Agreement expands the license to include uveitis, including NIPU, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
The New Collaboration Agreement provides us with a license to develop and sell EyePoint’s proprietary insert technology to deliver other corticosteroids to the back of the eye for the treatment and prevention of eye diseases in humans or to treat DME by delivering a compound to the back of the eye through a direct delivery method through an incision required for a 25-gauge or larger needle. We do not have the right to develop and sell EyePoint’s proprietary insert technology for indications for diseases outside of the eye anywhere in the world, or for the treatment of uveitis outside of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. EyePoint retained the right to develop and sell EyePoint’s proprietary insert technology for indications and countries not licensed to us. Further, our agreement with EyePoint permits EyePoint to grant to any other party the right to use its intellectual property (a) to treat DME through an incision smaller than that required for a 25-gauge needle, unless using a corticosteroid delivered to the back of the eye, (b) to deliver any compound outside the back of the eye unless it is to treat DME through an incision required for a 25-gauge or larger needle, or (c) to deliver non-corticosteroids to the back of the eye, unless it is to treat DME through an incision required for a 25-gauge or larger needle.
Before we entered into the New Collaboration Agreement, we were required to share 20% of our net profits on a country-by-country basis. We were permitted to offset up to 20% of this amount with our commercialization costs incurred during unprofitable calendar quarters in each country. The New Collaboration Agreement converts this profit share obligation to a royalty payable on global net revenues of ILUVIEN. We began paying a 2% royalty on net revenues and other related consideration to EyePoint effective July 1, 2017. This royalty amount increased to 6% effective December 12, 2018. We will pay an additional 2% royalty on global net revenues and other related consideration in excess of $75.0 million in any year. During 2018, we recognized approximately $998,000 of royalty expense. During 2017, we recognized approximately $621,000 of royalty and profit share expense.
Following the signing of the New Collaboration Agreement, we retained a right to offset $15.0 million of future royalty payments. This offset will be reduced by up to $5.0 million upon the earlier of the approval of ILUVIEN for posterior uveitis in any EU country or January 1, 2020, unless certain conditions under the New Collaboration Agreement are not met. As of December 31, 2018, the balance of the Future Offset was approximately $14.9 million.
We valued the additional rights we acquired under the New Collaboration Agreement utilizing a present value analysis of approximately $2,851,000. Because there was no approved indication for ILUVIEN for uveitis at the time, we expensed the $2,851,000 as a non-cash charge as in-process research and development expense in 2017. We also recognized $2,851,000 for recoverable collaboration costs for the value of the right of offset as a reduction of operating expenses. As a result, there was no impact on our operating loss or net loss for 2017.
Our license rights to EyePoint’s proprietary insert technology could revert to EyePoint if we were to:
(a) fail twice to cure our breach of an obligation to make certain payments to EyePoint following receipt of written notice of the breach; 
(b) fail to cure other breaches of material terms of our agreement with EyePoint within 30 days after notice of such breaches or such longer period (up to 90 days) as may be reasonably necessary if the breach cannot be cured within such 30-day period; 
(c) file for protection under the bankruptcy laws, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, appoint or suffer appointment of a receiver or trustee over our property, file a petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency act or have any such petition filed against us and such proceeding remains undismissed or unstayed for a period of more than 60 days; or 
(d) notify EyePoint in writing of our decision to abandon our license with respect to a certain product using EyePoint’s proprietary insert technology. We were not in breach of our agreement with EyePoint as of December 31, 2018.

Government Regulation
General Overview
Government authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate, among other things the research, development, testing, quality, efficacy, safety (pre- and post-marketing), manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, import, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In addition, although third parties manufacture ILUVIEN for us, these manufacturing operations and our research and development activities must follow applicable environmental laws and regulations. The cost to comply with these environmental laws and regulations is not currently significant, but in the future complying with these environmental laws and regulations could increase our costs for manufacturing, research and development.
U.S.
In the U.S., the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and other federal and local statutes and regulations, subjects pharmaceutical products to review. If we do not comply with applicable regulations, the government may refuse to approve or place our clinical studies on clinical hold, refuse to approve our marketing applications, refuse to allow us to manufacture or market our products, seize our products, impose injunctions and monetary fines on us, and prosecute us for criminal offenses.
To obtain approval of a new product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting the safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product and proposed labeling. 
The testing and collection of data and the preparation of the necessary applications are expensive and time consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approval that could delay or preclude us from marketing additional products. Once approved by the FDA, a drug requires an annual product and establishment fee, which was approximately $310,000 as of our last renewal in October 2018.
Post-Marketing Requirements
We are required to meet post-marketing safety surveillance requirements to continue marketing an approved product. We must report any adverse events with the product to the FDA and the FDA could impose market restrictions through labeling changes or in product removal. The FDA may withdraw product approvals if we fail to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems concerning safety and/or efficacy of the product occur following approval. The FDA may, at its discretion, also require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. The FDA did not require any post-marketing testing as part of its approval of ILUVIEN. As part of the approval process in Europe, we committed to conduct a five-year, post-authorization, open label registry study in 800 patients treated with ILUVIEN. Due to our post market safety surveillance not showing any unexpected safety signals, we requested and received approval to modify our protocol to cap enrollment in the study. Enrollment was completed with 562 patients. We anticipate this study to be completed in early 2020.
U.S. FDA Regulations
With respect to product advertising and promotion of marketed products, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulations that include standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotions, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and Internet promotional activities. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FD&C Act, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in (a) penalties, (b) the issuance of warning letters directing the sponsor to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials must be pre-cleared by the FDA, and (d) federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions (as well as state prosecutions).
The manufacturing facility that produces our product must maintain compliance with the FDA’s cGMP and is subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal and regulatory action, including Warning Letters, seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties.
Foreign Regulations
Foreign regulatory systems, although varying from country to country, include risks similar to those associated with FDA regulations in the U.S.
Under the EU regulatory system, applications for drug approval may be submitted either in a centralized or decentralized procedure. Under the centralized procedure, a single application to the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, if approved, 
15

would permit marketing of the product throughout the EU (currently 27 member states). The decentralized procedure provides for applications to be submitted for marketing authorization in a select number of EU countries. The process is managed by a Reference Member State that coordinates the review process with the other countries in the EEA in which the applicant has applied for marketing authorization.
A mutual recognition procedure of nationally approved decisions is available to pursue marketing authorizations for a product in the remaining EU countries. Under the mutual recognition procedure, the holders of national marketing authorization in one of the countries within the EU may submit further applications to other countries within the EU, who will be requested to recognize the original authorization.
We chose to pursue the decentralized procedure for ILUVIEN for DME and used the mutual recognition procedure due to our limited resources. Through this procedure, we obtained marketing authorizations in the 17 countries in the EEA discussed above. For ILUVIEN for NIPU, we filed a type II variation in these 17 countries in the EEA using the same procedure.
Third-Party Reimbursement and Pricing Controls
In the U.S., the EEA and elsewhere, sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third-party payers, such as government and private insurance plans. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, the ACA), significantly changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the ACA became effective beginning in 2010, although the current presidential administration and Congress have attempted to repeal it and replace it with a different health care law and have affected some of its key provisions through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. While we cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement policies this law or any replacement law will have in general or specifically on any product we commercialize, the ACA or any replacement may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of new products. Any rebates, discounts, taxes costs or regulatory or systematic changes on healthcare resulting from the ACA or its replacement may have a significant effect on our profitability in the future. We cannot predict whether the ACA will continue or what other laws or proposals will be made or adopted, or what impact these efforts may have on us.
We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability.
In many foreign markets, including the countries in the EEA, pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. In the U.S., there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing control. While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of those proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for ILUVIEN or any future products or product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Because we license certain intellectual property relating to ILUVIEN from third parties, we depend on their ability to obtain and maintain such protection. Where we have conducted our own research, our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
16

As of December 31, 2018, we owned or licensed seven U.S. utility patents, one U.S. design patent and one U.S. patent application as well as numerous foreign counterparts to many of these patents and patent applications relating to ILUVIEN or the ILUVIEN applicator. We licensed our seven utility patent rights relating to ILUVIEN from EyePoint. Pursuant to our agreement with EyePoint, our ILUVIEN-related patent rights are only for diseases of the human eye in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and for diseases of the human eye, excluding uveitis in the rest of the world. In addition to the U.S. patents licensed from EyePoint, we also license two European patents from EyePoint. We have a patent application pending directed to our applicator system for ILUVIEN. Our licensed patent portfolio includes U.S. patents (with no currently pending or issued corresponding European applications or patents) with claims directed to methods for administering a corticosteroid with an implantable sustained delivery device to deliver the corticosteroid to the vitreous of the eye wherein aqueous corticosteroid concentration is less than vitreous corticosteroid concentration during release.
U.S. utility patents generally have a term of 20 years from the date of filing. The utility patent rights relating to ILUVIEN that EyePoint licensed to us include seven U.S. patents that expire between March 2019 and August 2027 and counterpart filings to these patents in a number of other jurisdictions. The two European patents that EyePoint licensed to us that are directed to our low-dose device expire in April 2021 and October 2024. No patent term extension or supplementary protection certificate will be available for any of these U.S. or European patents or applications.
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology we develop. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before such product can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Research and Development
We invested $1.1 million and $4.2 million in research and development during 2018 and 2017, respectively. The 2017 investment includes a $2.9 million non-cash charge as in-process research and development expense for the additional rights we acquired under the New Collaboration Agreement with EyePoint.
Employees
As of January 31, 2019, we had 124 employees, all of whom were full-time employees.
