Overview 
 Brightcove Inc., or Brightcove, is a leading global provider of cloud-based services for video. Brightcove was incorporated in Delaware in August 2004 and our headquarters are in Boston, Massachusetts. Our suite of products and services reduces the cost and complexity associated with publishing, distributing, measuring and monetizing video across devices. 
 Brightcove Video Cloud, or Video Cloud, our flagship product released in 2006, is the worlds leading online video platform. Video Cloud enables our customers to publish and distribute video to Internet-connected devices quickly, easily and in a cost-effective and high-quality manner. Brightcove Zencoder, or Zencoder, is a cloud-based video encoding service. Brightcove SSAI, or SSAI, is an innovative, cloud-based ad insertion and video stitching service that addresses the limitations of traditional online video ad insertion technology. Brightcove Player, or Player, is a cloud-based service for creating and managing video player experiences. Brightcove OTT Flow is a service for media companies and content owners to rapidly deploy high-quality, direct-to-consumer, live and on-demand video services across platforms. Brightcove Video Marketing Suite, or Video Marketing Suite, is a comprehensive suite of video technologies designed to address the needs of marketers to drive awareness, engagement and conversion. Brightcove Enterprise Video Suite, or Enterprise Video Suite, is an enterprise-class platform for internal communications, employee training, live streaming, marketing and ecommerce videos. 
 Since 2014, our go-to-market approach for our solutions has been focused primarily on (i) media companies and (ii) enterprises and organizations in a wide range of use cases. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 3,783 customers in over 80 countries, including many of the worlds leading media companies, broadcasters, publishers, brands and corporations, as well as governments, educational institutions and non-profit organizations. 
 We primarily generate revenue by offering our products to customers on a subscription-based, software as a service, or SaaS, model. Our revenue grew from $155.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $164.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, we had 4,168 customers, of which 2,167 used our premium offerings and 2,001 used our volume offerings. As of December 31, 2018, we had 3,783 customers, of which 2,226 used our premium offerings and 1,557 used our volume offerings. Substantially all of our revenue has historically been attributable to our Video Cloud product, and we expect that revenue from Video Cloud will continue to comprise a significant portion of our revenue. In addition to being offered on a stand-alone basis, Video Cloud is also a core component of OTT Flow, Video Marketing Suite and Enterprise Video Suite. 
 We recently signed a definitive agreement to acquire Ooyala, Inc.s online video platform technology, including the video content management and publishing platform Backlot, Analytics, Live, and its associated patents and other intellectual property. As part of the transaction, we will acquire substantial portions of Ooyalas engineering, support, and sales staff, including the companys Guadalajara, Mexico operations. We intend to take on all customer, reseller, and partner relationships utilized by Ooyalas online video platform business globally.

Our Business Strengths

The majority of our revenue comes from annual contracts. Our existing contracts provide us with visibility into revenue that has not yet been recognized. We have also achieved an overall recurring dollar retention rate of at least 94% in each of the last four fiscal quarters, including 103%, 95%, 94% and 104% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, June 30, 2018, September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Our business model and customer loyalty provide greater levels of recurring revenue and predictability compared to traditional, perpetual-license business models.

Training 
 We offer free basic online training to registered users of our products. We also offer customized, onsite training for customers that is priced on a per engagement basis.

 An important component of our sales strategy is our account management organization. This organization is focused on ongoing customer success and engagement, as well as contract renewals and upsells to our customer base. 
Professional Services 
 While our products are easy for customers to use and deploy without any additional specialized services, we offer a range of professional services for customers who seek customization of our products or assistance with their implementations. These professional services are priced on a time and materials basis or a per project basis and include projects such as content migrations from other vendors or in-house solutions, video player enhancements, mobile and connected TV app development and the creation of web pages optimized for video. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We sell our products primarily through our global direct sales organization. Our sales team is organized by the following geographic regions: Americas, Europe and the Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Japan. We further organize our go-to-market approach by focusing our sales and marketing teams on selling primarily to (i) media companies, who generally want to distribute video content to a broad audience and (ii) enterprises and organizations in a wide range of industries, who generally use video for marketing or enterprise communication purposes. A small amount of sales are generated through referral partners, channel partners and resellers. We also sell some of our products online through our website.

 Operations 
 We use a number of third-party cloud computing platforms to provide our products and services to customers. We take advantage of this geographically dispersed, third-party, cloud computing capacity to improve the responsiveness of our service and lower network latency for our customers. We also operate our own servers for systems that manage meta-data and business rules. 
 Media delivery to end users, including video, audio, images and JavaScript components, is served primarily through CDN providers, including Akamai and Fastly. We believe our agreements with our CDN providers are based on competitive market terms and conditions, including service level commitments from these CDN providers. 
 We entered into our agreement with Akamai in July 2010. It enables us to use Akamai CDN services for our own benefit and to resell Akamai CDN services to our customers. The current expiration date of the agreement is April 30, 2020. 
 We entered into our agreement with Fastly in April 2017. It enables us to use Fastly CDN services for our own benefit and to resell Fastly CDN services to our customers. The agreement is currently automatically renewing on a month to month basis, through January 31, 2020. We expect to enter into a new agreement with Fastly in the first half of 2019. 
 Our agreements with each of Akamai and Fastly contain a service continuation period following expiration of the agreement, which we believe is sufficient to enable transition to an alternative provider to avoid material disruption to our business or to our customers. Our agreement with Akamai provides that, upon termination, Akamai will continue to provide CDN services to our existing customers for up to twelve months. Our agreement with Fastly provides that, upon termination by Fastly, Fastly will continue to provide CDN services for up to six months. 
 We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide cloud-based computing and storage to our customers. We entered into our agreement with AWS on May 17, 2012. We believe our agreement with AWS is based on competitive market terms and conditions, including service level commitments. The current expiration date of our agreement with AWS is July 31, 2019, and we are working with AWS to renew the contract. Our agreement with AWS provides that, upon termination, AWS will continue to store our content for 30 days and will, upon mutual agreement, provide additional post-termination assistance. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely principally on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, confidential information, business strategies and brands. We also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our employees coupled with the creation of new features, functionality and products are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, and we rigorously control access to our proprietary technology. 
 In the United States, we have 36 issued and/or allowed patents and 4 patent applications pending. Internationally, we have 17 issued and/or allowed patents and we are currently pursuing 17 patent applications, including two patent applications undergoing examination at the European Patent Office. We currently have patent applications pending in Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and Hong Kong, and we may seek coverage in additional jurisdictions to the extent we determine such coverage is appropriate and cost-effective. Our issued patents cover a variety of technical domains relevant to our business, including aspects of publishing and distributing digital media online, cloud-based stream delivery and ad insertion. 
 
11 


 Our registered trademarks in the United States include BRIGHTCOVE, ZENCODER, ONCEVOD and our logo. These trademarks are also registered in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the European Union and Canada. We may apply for registrations for these and other marks in additional jurisdictions to the extent we determine such coverage is appropriate and cost-effective. 
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products with the same functionality as our solutions. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and expensive. Our competitors could also independently develop technologies equivalent to ours, and our intellectual property rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from selling products incorporating those technologies. 
 Competition 
 We compete with video-sharing sites such as YouTube, in-house solutions, online video platforms and a broad range of other technology providers. Some of our actual and potential competitors may enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as larger marketing budgets and larger sales teams, as well as greater financial, technical and other resources. The overall markets for our products are fragmented, rapidly evolving and highly competitive. 
 We expect that the competitive landscape will change as our markets consolidate and mature. We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry include the following: 
 

 | total cost of ownership;
--+-------------------------


 | breadth and depth of product functionality;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | level of resources and investment in sales, marketing, product and technology;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ease of deployment and use of solutions;
--+-----------------------------------------


 | level of integration into existing workflows, configurability, scalability and reliability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | customer service;
--+------------------


 | brand awareness and reputation;
--+--------------------------------


 | ability to integrate with third-party applications and technologies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


 | size and scale of provider; and
--+--------------------------------


 | size of customer base and level of user adoption.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 The mix of factors relevant in any given situation varies with regard to each prospective customer. We believe we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors. 
 Some of our competitors have made or may make acquisitions or enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive service than we do. These combinations may make it more difficult for us to compete effectively, including on the basis of price, sales and marketing programs, technology or service functionality. We expect these challenges to continue as organizations attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions. 
 Research and Development 
 We have focused our research and development efforts on expanding the functionality and scalability of our products and enhancing their ease of use, as well as creating new product offerings. We expect research and
