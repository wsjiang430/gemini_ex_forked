(Dollars in millions, except per-share amounts or unless otherwise noted)
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
General Dynamics is a global aerospace and defense company that offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; information technology (IT) services; C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions; and shipbuilding and ship repair.
General Dynamics was incorporated in Delaware in 1952. Long periods of growth, organic and inorganic, defined our early history leading up to the early 1990s, when we shed most elements of our portfolio with the exception of military vehicles and submarines. We took subsequent actions beginning in the mid-1990s that laid the foundation for modern-day General Dynamics, including acquiring Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, combat-vehicle businesses, IT services and C4ISR solutions companies, and additional shipyards.
During 2018, we continued to position our company for future growth and superior profitability. On April 3, 2018, we completed the acquisition of CSRA Inc. (CSRA), our largest acquisition to date. Combining CSRA with our General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) business unit created a premier provider of IT solutions to the defense, intelligence and federal civilian markets.
Concurrent with the acquisition, for segment reporting purposes, we reorganized our Information Systems and Technology operating segment into two separate segments: Information Technology and Mission Systems. Our company now has five operating segments: Aerospace, Combat Systems, Information Technology, Mission Systems and Marine Systems. The latter four segments we collectively refer to as our defense segments. Prior-period segment information has been restated for this change.
Some of our segments consist of multiple business units. Each business unit is responsible for its strategy and operational performance, emphasizing the importance of flexibility and agility for those closest to the customer. Our corporate headquarters sets the overall strategy and governance for the company and is responsible for allocating and deploying capital. Our Ethos—based upon honesty, transparency, trust and alignment—undergirds our culture, our business model and our decision-making. 
We are focused on delivering superior shareholder returns by exceeding our customers’ expectations and committing to operational excellence. Our priorities are executing on backlog; managing costs; implementing continuous improvement; and maximizing earnings, cash and return on invested capital.
Following is additional information on each of our operating segments.
AEROSPACE

Bath Iron Works builds the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided-missile destroyers and manages modernization and lifecycle support. These high-utility, multi-mission ships are capable of fighting simultaneous air, surface and subsurface battles. The Navy restarted the program in 2010 after a four-year break in construction. Bath Iron Works delivered the first ship in the restart program to the Navy in 2017. In 2018, we were awarded contracts for the construction of five additional DDG-51s, for a total of 11 ships in backlog, scheduled for delivery through 2027.
Bath Iron Works is one of the Navy’s contractors involved in the development and construction of the Zumwalt-class (DDG-1000) platform, the Navy’s next-generation guided-missile destroyer. These ships are equipped with numerous technological enhancements, including a low radar profile, an integrated power system and a software environment tying together nearly every system on the ship. The DDG-1000 provides independent forward presence and deterrence, supports special operations forces, and operates as an integral part of joint expeditionary forces. We delivered the first ship in 2016 and the second ship in 2018. We continue to build the final ship, scheduled for delivery in 2020.
NASSCO is building Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) auxiliary support ships, a second variant of the Expeditionary Support Dock (ESD) ships. ESBs serve as floating forward staging bases, improving the Navy and Marine Corps’ ability to deliver large-scale equipment and expeditionary forces to areas without adequate port access. Equipped with a 52,000-square-foot flight deck and accommodations for up to 250 personnel, they are capable of supporting diverse missions, including airborne mine countermeasure, maritime security operations and disaster relief missions. In 2018, we delivered the fourth ESB and secured long-lead materials funding for a sixth ship. We expect to deliver the fifth ESB in 2019.
NASSCO was competitively awarded an exclusive design and construction contract in 2016 for the lead ship in the Navy’s new class of fleet replenishment oilers, the John Lewis class (T-AO-205), along with options for five additional ships. Designed to transfer fuel to Navy surface ships operating at sea, the oilers can carry 157,000 barrels of fuel and also offer significant dry cargo capacity and aviation capabilities. In 2018, we began construction on the first ship, the future USNS John Lewis.
Our Marine Systems segment provides comprehensive ship and submarine maintenance, modernization and lifecycle support services to extend the service life of these ships. NASSCO conducts full-service maintenance and surface-ship repair operations in Navy fleet concentration areas in San Diego, Norfolk, Mayport, and Puget Sound. Electric Boat provides submarine maintenance and modernization services in a variety of U.S. locations, and Bath Iron Works provides lifecycle support services for Navy surface ships. In support of allied navies, we offer program management, planning, engineering and design support for submarine and surface-ship construction programs.
In addition to our work for the Navy, the Marine Systems segment has extensive experience in all phases of commercial ship construction. We have designed and built oil and product tankers and container and cargo ships for commercial customers since the 1970s. These ships satisfy our commercial customers’ Jones Act requirement that ships carrying cargo between U.S. ports be built in U.S. shipyards.
We offer advanced commercial shipbuilding technology as demonstrated by NASSCO’s design and delivery of the world’s first liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered containerships. Using green ship technology, we have decreased emissions dramatically while increasing fuel efficiency. From 2014 to 2017, NASSCO constructed and delivered eight LNG-conversion-ready product tankers for commercial customers. In 2018, we began construction on the second ship in a two-ship series of Kanaloa-class containerships. The two new LNG-capable containerships with roll-on, roll-off capability are scheduled for delivery in 2019 and 2020.

To promote operating efficiency, innovation and affordability for our customers, we make strategic investments in our business, often in cooperation with the Navy. We leverage our design and engineering expertise across shipyards to improve program execution and generate cost savings. This knowledge sharing enables us to use resources more efficiently and drive process improvements. Through robust and disciplined planning, we are positioned to support our customers well into the future.
Revenue for the Marine Systems segment was 24% of our consolidated revenue in 2018 and 26% in 2017 and 2016. Revenue by major products and services was as follows:

Year Ended December 31 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Nuclear-powered submarines | $ | 5,712 | | | $ | 5,175 | | $ | 5,264
Surface ships | 1,872 | | | 1,607 | | | 1,648
Repair and other services | 918 | | | 1,222 | | | 1,160
Total Marine Systems | $ | 8,502 | | | $ | 8,004 | | $ | 8,072

CUSTOMERS
In 2018, 65% of our consolidated revenue was from the U.S. government, 14% was from U.S. commercial customers, 10% was from non-U.S. commercial customers and the remaining 11% was from non-U.S. government customers.
U.S. GOVERNMENT
Our primary customer is the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). We also contract with other U.S. government customers, including the intelligence community, the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, and first-responder agencies. Our revenue from the U.S. government was as follows:

Year Ended December 31 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
DoD | $ | 17,752 | | | $ | 15,441 | | | $ | 15,080
Non-DoD | 5,228 | | | 2,904 | | | 2,883 | 
Foreign Military Sales (FMS)* | 626 | | | 676 | | | 713 | 
Total U.S. government | $ | 23,606 | | | $ | 19,021 | | | $ | 18,676
% of total revenue | 65 | % | | 61 | % | | 61 | %

* In addition to our direct non-U.S. sales, we sell to non-U.S. governments through the FMS program. Under the FMS program, we contract with and are paid by the U.S. government, and the U.S. government assumes the risk of collection from the non-U.S. government customer.
Our U.S. government revenue is derived from fixed-price, cost-reimbursement and time-and-materials contracts. Our production contracts are primarily fixed-price. Under these contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount. Contracts for research, engineering, repair and maintenance, and other services are typically cost-reimbursement or time-and-materials. Under cost-reimbursement contracts, the customer reimburses contract costs incurred and pays a fixed, incentive or award-based fee. These fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract, such as cost, quality, schedule and performance. Under time-and-materials contracts, the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials.
Of our U.S. government revenue, fixed-price contracts accounted for 56% in 2018, 54% in 2017 and 53% in 2016; cost-reimbursement contracts accounted for 38% in 2018, 42% in 2017 and 43% in 2016; and time-and-materials contracts accounted for 6% in 2018 and 4% in 2017 and 2016.
For information on the advantages and disadvantages of each of these contract types, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

U.S. COMMERCIAL
Our U.S. commercial revenue was $5 billion in 2018 and $4.5 billion in 2017 and 2016. This represented 14% of our consolidated revenue in 2018 and 15% in 2017 and 2016. The majority of this revenue is for business-jet aircraft and related services where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies across a wide range of industries. 
NON-U.S.
Our revenue from non-U.S. government and commercial customers was $7.6 billion in 2018, $7.5 billion in 2017 and $7.4 billion in 2016. This represented 21% of our consolidated revenue in 2018 and 24% in 2017 and 2016.
We conduct business with customers around the world. Our non-U.S. defense subsidiaries maintain long-term relationships with their customers and have established themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers, providing a broad portfolio of products and services.
Our non-U.S. commercial revenue consists primarily of business-jet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services. The market for business-jet aircraft and related services outside North America has expanded significantly in recent years. While the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in North America, orders from customers outside North America represent a significant portion of our aircraft business with approximately 45% of the Aerospace segment’s total backlog on December 31, 2018.
COMPETITION
Several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and business-aviation markets. While customers’ evaluation criteria vary, the principal competitive elements include:

• | the technical excellence, reliability, safety and cost competitiveness of our products and services;


• | our ability to innovate and develop new products and technologies that improve mission performance and adapt to dynamic threats;


• | successful program execution and on-time delivery of complex, integrated systems;


• | our global footprint and accessibility to customers;


• | the reputation and customer confidence derived from past performance; and


• | the successful management of customer relationships.

DEFENSE MARKET COMPETITION
The U.S. government contracts with numerous domestic and non-U.S. companies for products and services. We compete against other large platform and system-integration contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability. Outside the United States, we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and state-owned defense manufacturers. Our Combat Systems segment competes with a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. businesses. Our Information Technology and Mission Systems segments compete with many companies, from large defense companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies or expertise. Our Marine Systems segment has one primary competitor with which it also partners on the Virginia-class submarine program. The operating cycle of many of our major platform programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully.
We are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors. Competitions for major defense programs often require companies to form teams to bring together a spectrum of capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements. Opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the 
15

program’s integrator, overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on a team, or as a provider of a specific component or subsystem.
BUSINESS-JET AIRCRAFT MARKET COMPETITION
The Aerospace segment has several competitors for each of its Gulfstream products. Key competitive factors include aircraft safety, reliability and performance; comfort and in-flight productivity; service quality, global footprint and responsiveness; technological and new-product innovation; and price. We believe that Gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas.
The Aerospace segment competes worldwide in the business-jet aircraft services market primarily on the basis of price, quality and timeliness. In our maintenance, repair and FBO businesses, the segment competes with several other large companies as well as a number of smaller companies, particularly in the maintenance business. In our completions business, the segment competes with several service providers.
BACKLOG
Our total backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts and includes funded and unfunded portions. For additional discussion of backlog, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7.
Summary backlog information for each of our segments follows:

 | | | | | 2018 TotalBacklog NotExpected to BeCompleted in 2019

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
To foster innovative product development and evolution, we conduct sustained R&D activities as part of our normal business operations. Most of our Aerospace segment’s R&D activities support Gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs. In our U.S. defense operations, we conduct customer-sponsored R&D activities under government contracts and company-sponsored R&D activities, investing in technologies and capabilities that provide innovative solutions for our customers. In accordance with government regulations, we recover a portion of company-sponsored R&D expenditures through overhead charges to U.S. government contracts. For more information on our company-sponsored R&D activities, including our expenditures for the past three years, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We develop technology, manufacturing processes and systems-integration practices. In addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property, we license some intellectual property rights to and from others. The U.S. government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the performance of U.S. government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents. Although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business, no existing patent, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business.
EMPLOYEES
On December 31, 2018, our subsidiaries had 105,600 employees, approximately one-fifth of whom work under collective agreements with various labor unions and worker representatives. Agreements covering approximately 5% of total employees are due to expire in 2019. Historically, we have renegotiated these labor agreements without any significant disruption to operating activities.
RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIERS AND SEASONALITY
We depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials, components and subsystems. Our U.S. government customer is a supplier on some of our programs. These supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints, which can put pressure on our costs. Effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance. We sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could impact our ability to meet our customer commitments. We attempt to mitigate risks with our suppliers by entering into long-term agreements and leveraging company-wide agreements to achieve economies of scale, and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts. We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.
Our business is not seasonal in nature. The receipt of contract awards, the availability of funding from the customer, the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are all factors that influence the timing of our revenue. In the United States, these factors are influenced by the federal government’s budget cycle based on its October-to-September fiscal year. 
REGULATORY MATTERS
U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
U.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) govern the majority of our contracts. The FAR mandates uniform policies and procedures for U.S. government acquisitions and purchased services. Also, individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the FAR. For example, the DoD implements the FAR through the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). For all federal government entities, the FAR regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition, including:

• | acquisition planning;


• | competition requirements;


• | contractor qualifications;

17


• | protection of source selection and vendor information; and


• | acquisition procedures.

In addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.
NON-U.S. REGULATORY
Our non-U.S. operations are subject to the applicable government regulations and procurement policies and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.
BUSINESS-JET AIRCRAFT
The Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). For an aircraft to be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness. Aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority, which often is accomplished through a supplemental type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.
ENVIRONMENTAL
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation and remediation of materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations. We are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at third-party sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency. As a PRP, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination. In cases where we have been designated a PRP, generally we seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate cost-recovery actions. In the unlikely event that we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site, the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other PRPs. We regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters.
Operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. Historically, these costs have not been material. Environmental costs often are recoverable under our contracts with the U.S. government. Based on information currently available and current U.S. government policies relating to cost recovery, we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters, see Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
