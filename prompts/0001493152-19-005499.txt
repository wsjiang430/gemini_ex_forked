ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
 
We began operations in 1988, under the ownership and control of Ardell Mees, who provided installation services to grocery decor design companies. On January 4, 2001, we incorporated in North Dakota as ADM Enterprises, Inc. On May 9, 2006, the Company changed both its name to ADM Endeavors, Inc. (“ADM Endeavors,” or the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and its domicile to the state of Nevada. On July 1, 2008, the Company acquired all of the assets of ADM Enterprises, LLC (“ADM Enterprises”), a sole proprietorship owned by Ardell and Tammera Mees, in exchange for 10,000,000 newly issued shares of our common stock. As a result, ADM Enterprises became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company.
 
On April 19, 2018, the Company acquired Just Right Products, Inc. (“Just Right Products”), a Texas corporation. The acquisition of 100% of Just Right Products from its sole shareholder was through a stock exchange whereas the ADM Endeavors, Inc. issued 2,000,000 shares of restricted Series A preferred stock. Each share of the Series A preferred stock is convertible into ten shares of common stock and each share has 100 votes on a fully diluted basis. The Preferred Shares represents 61% of voting shares, thus there is a change of voting control and the transaction will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition. As a result of the transaction, Just Right Products became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Even though the Company was incorporated on January 4, 2001, it had no operations until the share exchange agreement with ADM Enterprises on July 1, 2008. All business operations are those of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Just Right Products and ADM Enterprises from April 2018.


In May 2013, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to provide for an increase in its authorized share capital. The authorized common stock increased to 800,000,000 shares at a par value of $0.001 per share and preferred stock increased to 80,000,000 shares at a par value of $0.001 per share.


Current Business Operations


Just Right Products, Inc.
 
Since 2010, Just Right Products, Inc. has operated a diverse vertical integrated business, which consists of a retail sales division, screen print promotions, embroidery production, digital production, import wholesale sourcing, and uniforms.
 
The Retail Sales Division focuses on any product with a logo. It sells a very wide range of products from business cards to coffee cups. Its motto is “We sell anything with a logo.” Just Right Products’ salespeople excel at sales because they are selling the items people like to buy. Our sales consist of sales made by in-house hourly employees and commissioned-based employees. In house accounts are more profitable for Just Right Products than commissioned sales. Based on profitability reasons, Just Right Products has focus resources on SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and Website to develop more in-house customers.
 
The Screen Printing Department utilizes its 5 screen printing machines to print garments. The department can produce over 8,000 units per day. There are two types of orders, as follows: 1) Retail – where printing is done on purchased products, and 2) Contract printing – performed on wholesale customer provided products. Retail sales printing is more profitable whereas contract printing is less profitable but is beneficial at maximizing production space. Just Right Products is currently operating at 40% of capacity with its current equipment therefore, growth without additional equipment is feasible.
 
The Embroidery equipment has 51 heads of embroidery capacity. It is the same type of production as screen printing, as stated above, in regards to retail and contract embroidery. The Embroidery Department is operating at 30% of capacity with its current equipment therefore, growth without additional equipment is feasible.
 
The Digital Department also operates in the same manner as screen printing and embroidery and is operating at 50% of capacity based on its current equipment with significant growth potential.
 
All production departments have more equipment exceeding the workload of the employees’ potential. This gives Just Right Products the ability for expansion in revenue with the hiring of additional employees, and/or having the luxury of having backup equipment eliminating down time and the ability large jobs with the help of part-time employees. The additional equipment is also part of an expansion plan.
 
The Import Department sources products for retail and wholesale customers. Just Right Products has employees fluent in Chinese thereby affording the Company to significant opportunities to deal directly with factories in China. The Company, through its situation, has China-based sub-contractors, on an as needed basis, for factory inspections and quality control. The Import Division has great potential based on in-house production.
 
The Uniform Division sells uniforms to businesses and schools. Its’ advantages over its competition is in-house production and international sourcing.

ADM Enterprises 
 
We provide customized construction and installation of grocery store decor for both new and renovated grocery stores. Our service and expertise include the installation of grocery checkout stands, grid ceilings, cart-stops, shelving, customer service counter, office cabinetry and other grocery store equipment and fixtures. Our clients primarily consist of design companies, most of whom are subsidiaries of major retail grocery chains, or are affiliated with Associated Wholesale Grocers, the nation’s second largest retailer-owned grocery wholesaler. We believe that our success is the result of both our quality installation of grocery equipment and fixtures, and high level of personal service that we provide to our customers. We receive bid requests from all regions of the United States. Therefore, we are seeking to expand our operations to service additional geographic areas.
 
The majority of our contracts have been in the Midwestern United States including North Dakota, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. Over the past 25 years, ADM Endeavors has completed projects in 25 states, including North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Wyoming, Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Illinois, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, California, Nevada, and Florida.
 
The main focus of our expansion plan includes primarily the Midwestern United States including the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Nebraska, and Kansas, as well as some southern states such as Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi.
 
To effectuate our business plan during the next twelve months, we must increase our current customer base, as well as acquire additional employees and equipment so that we may accommodate our expanded customer base. We anticipate that we will establish an online presence to increase our market visibility and corporate recognition. We believe we can establish our industry presence and stimulate interest by constructing a trade show booth to market our services when we attend annual grocer tradeshows and conventions.
 
Use of Grocery Decor Installation Services in the Construction and Remodeling Industry has grown tremendously in recent years. The retail grocery industry is highly competitive and requires constant innovations to attract and retain customers. Accordingly, neighborhood markets battle for patrons by catering to customers’ desires for a modern, clean, and convenient shopping experience. Grocery stores, therefore, typically renovate every five to six years to maintain a new image.
 
In the past, store workers, painters or carpenters installed decor items. However, as the designs and materials became increasingly elaborate, the need for specialized and experienced installers grew. The installation process requires that an installer have special knowledge of various aspects of construction, including framing, finishing, and remodeling. Additionally, knowledge of standards for product usage, hanging methods and quality control are extremely helpful. As a result of the frequency of store renovations, coupled with the complexity of the items being installed secures the demand for custom installation services.

Competition


Just Right Products, Inc. 
 
In the past five years the United States promotional products industry expanded greatly. With annual revenues of over $23 billion and growth of over 3% per year, the industry employs over 250,000 people in over 26,000 businesses. Similar to other advertising industries over the period, the growing economy fostered healthy consumer spending, so businesses respond by increasing expenditures on advertisements to capture the attention of shoppers and downstream clients. In addition, an increase in the total number of US businesses added to the industry’s potential pool of clientele, as new companies often use promotional products to endorse their business, product or service. Over the next five years, continued growth in corporate profit and total advertising expenditure will boost industry demand, compelling companies to spend more on promotional products
 
Every single consumer for every single product is a potential recipient of branded promotional products. Countless thousands of promotional products have a far greater reaching impact than most people might think, considering the following facts: (source; PPIA)
 

● | 83% of customers say they enjoy receiving a promotional product with an advertising message; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | After receiving a promotional product, 85% of customers say they do business with the company; 
● | 58% of customers keep a promotional product for up to four years; 
● | 89% of customers can recall the advertiser on a promotional product they received in the past two years; and 
● | A promotional product increases the effectiveness of other media by 44%. 

ADM Enterprises, Inc.
 
We believe that the installation business competes on price, reputation for quality, timeliness, familiarity with retail construction, the availability of aggregate materials and financial strength. We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the foregoing factors. The market for construction services, particularly services to national retail chains, is highly competitive. Several of our competitors are larger, better known and have substantially greater marketing, financial, personnel and other resources, including established reputations and working relationships, than we do. We cannot guaranty that our services will continue to be competitive in the market place. Our primary competitor in our respective market area of the Midwest is PFI, Inc., based in Denver, Colorado.
 
ADM ’s chief competitors are located primarily in larger cities. The following identifies those with whom ADM competes on a regular basis and their applicable market share:
 

Competitor | Location | Market Share 
------------------------+---------------------+-----------------
PFP | Kansas City, MO | 20% 
A.N. Decor | Minneapolis, MN | 20% 
PFI, Inc. | Denver, CO | 60% 
Twin Store Fixtures | Chicago, Ill | 40% 
Jamison Sign Co. | Spokane, WA | 30% 

 
These particular locations are representative of the markets in which ADM already does a small percentage of business. Because of past success in these markets, it is ADM’s belief that establishing a full-time presence will build revenues very quickly.
 
ADM’s reputation in the industry will be the basis for expanding into these new markets. Word of mouth and designer referrals has led to the company’s success up to the present time. Consequently, ADM staff will contact any and all designers in these designated markets to obtain referrals and will send introductory letters upon entering the market.
 
Some of the targeted markets for expansion currently are showing enough demand for services that the full-time presence is already justified, and those locations would grow even more quickly. Those select locations are scheduled first for expansion.
