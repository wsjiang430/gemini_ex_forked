Item 1. Business
Overview
Yext is a knowledge engine. Our platform lets businesses control their digital knowledge in the cloud and sync it to more than 150 services and applications, which we refer to as our Knowledge Network, and includes Amazon Alexa, Apple Maps, Bing, Cortana, Facebook, Google, Google Assistant, Google Maps, Siri and Yelp. Digital knowledge is the structured information that a business wants to make publicly accessible. For example, in food service, the address, phone number or menu details of a restaurant; in healthcare, the health insurances accepted by a physician or the precise drop‑off point of the emergency room at a hospital campus; or in finance, the ATM locations, retail bank holiday hours or insurance agent biographies. We believe a business is the ultimate authority on its own digital knowledge, and it is our mission to put that business in control of it, everywhere.
Intelligent search, which are searches of digital knowledge that combine context and intent, has grown significantly in recent years. Unlike traditional web-based search where many results are displayed as a list requiring further exploration, web and mobile applications and voice and artificial intelligence, or AI, engines are increasingly answering questions directly and in certain cases providing only one answer. As intelligent search grows, and increasingly leverages AI, consumers are more likely to rely on these direct answers, rather than clicking through websites to find information about a company. The source of the results for intelligent searches is not a web page - it is structured data. Businesses and service providers want their digital knowledge to be accurate, compelling and more prominent than that of their competitors when consumers look for them on search platforms, mobile applications, voice assistants, social media, connected devices and other digital sources. Our solution drives commerce by providing updated digital knowledge that allows consumers to find the businesses and service providers that are most relevant to them.
The vast majority of digital knowledge provided by searches currently comes from third‑party sources such as data aggregators, governmental agencies and consumers. The net result of this third‑party sourcing has been to produce “best guess” data that can often miss or misstate the true digital knowledge for businesses worldwide. We pioneered a better way to source critical digital knowledge. We have built our business on the fundamental premise that the best source of accurate and timely digital knowledge about a business is the business itself. We have established direct data integrations with applications in our Knowledge Network that end consumers around the globe use to discover new businesses, read reviews and find accurate answers to their queries. Our platform ensures that our customers’ digital knowledge is available, accurate and consistent across our Knowledge Network. Businesses can directly control their own digital knowledge rather than leaving it in the hands of third parties, thereby making our platform the system of record for such vital knowledge.
We are increasingly using the structured data on our platform to expand or add new integrations with vertically specialized applications, voice‑based search and AI engines. Our provision of structured digital knowledge, directly produced and managed by businesses and professional service providers themselves, helps ensure the accuracy of search results whether they are presented in traditional search results, an information card or an answer from a digital assistant.
Businesses and professional service providers of nearly all sizes and in a diverse set of industries can benefit from our platform and capabilities. The Yext Knowledge Engine enables businesses and professional service providers to:

• | modify, enhance and control digital knowledge attributes for each of their locations, professionals, menus, events or other entities managed with our platform;


• | update once and disseminate changes to their listings across the most widely used third‑party maps, apps, search engines, GPS systems, digital assistants, vertical directories and social networks that consumers rely upon today;


• | create and update search‑optimized landing pages for their locations, professionals and events on their own websites;


• | encourage consumer reviews for inclusion on their landing pages; and


• | analyze how features in the platform drive consumer engagement.

We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our revenue was $228.3 million, $170.2 million and $124.3 million, respectively, and our net loss was $74.8 million, $66.6 million and $43.2 million, respectively.

Industry Background
Consumer Discovery Has Changed. Intelligent search has grown significantly in recent years. Businesses are now able to leverage intelligent search to help individuals discover what they need without having to necessarily visit the business’s own website and return digital knowledge directly responsive to a search. 
Knowledge Is Fundamental. Businesses spend significant sums on developing their brands and creating product and market awareness. When potential consumers reached through those efforts want to make a purchase, businesses need their digital knowledge to be widely available and correct so that they can be found efficiently. Inaccurate or incomplete information results in lost sales opportunities, negative brand experiences and organizational inefficiencies.
Intelligent Search Drives Commerce. When searching for a business, consumers need to know many relevant attributes such as qualifications of a wealth advisor, amenities at a hotel, or the agenda of an event. As a result, businesses and professional service providers must ensure that their digital knowledge is available, accurate and consistent so that they can be found. Moreover, businesses and professional service providers want to make sure that they appear prominently online when nearby consumers search for them. 
Managing Digital Knowledge Is Challenging
Many businesses lack the capabilities to effectively control, structure and manage digital knowledge across the digital ecosystem where consumers discover businesses. This lack of management capability is due to several factors:

• | Lack of Control of Digital Knowledge. The vast majority of digital knowledge currently comes from third‑party sources such as data aggregators, governmental agencies and consumers. The net result of this third‑party sourcing has been to produce “best guess” data that can often miss or misstate the true digital knowledge for businesses worldwide. 


• | Attributes that Comprise Digital Knowledge Are Expanding. Businesses need to be able to define their digital knowledge using detailed, category-specific attributes about their business ranging from name, address and phone number to more detailed items such as whether a hotel accepts pets, a restaurant has a gluten-free menu or a doctor accepts certain insurance plans. 


• | Digital Knowledge Is Dynamic. Digital knowledge increasingly includes dynamic attributes that change frequently, such as opening hours, holiday hours, menus, events and promotions. 


• | Digital Knowledge Exists in Many Places. The number of applications that leverage digital knowledge continues to increase, with the proliferation of vertical search applications and intelligent search using mobile, voice-based and in-app search. Businesses need an efficient way to control their digital knowledge across a multitude of services, such as Google, Facebook and Yelp. 

Businesses Need to Provide Customers with Relevant and Actionable Information. When consumers search for businesses, they expect to be able to quickly find all of the relevant information they need about those organizations. Furthermore, the increase in the number of mobile users around the world has resulted in the need for business information to be available on the applications where consumers engage and to be presented in a way that is consistent with the language and customs of each geography in which consumers reside.
Existing Alternatives Are Inadequate. Traditional methods for managing digital knowledge include paper or legacy software‑based solutions, such as word processors or spreadsheets. Simply managing and updating information within the few core search engines, such as Google and Bing, through these traditional methods is already very challenging, and becomes even more so when implementing updates on newer services such as Instagram, Snapchat and Uber. 
Customer Reviews Are of Critical and Growing Importance. Many major applications now include customer review data in their search results and may rank businesses and professional service providers based on the number, quality and recency of reviews. A limited number of reviews or a few poor reviews without offsetting positive reviews may result in an otherwise lower search ranking in certain applications.
Growth Strategy
Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Grow Our Customer Base. We believe that there is a substantial opportunity to continue to increase the size of our customer base across a broad range of industries and companies, and to include more professional service providers, such as individual doctors, insurance agents and financial services professionals, in addition to businesses. We plan to continue to invest in our direct sales force to grow our customer base, both domestically and internationally. 


• | Continue to Enter Attractive Industry Verticals. As of January 31, 2019, we have addressed specific industry verticals and we plan to continue this go-to-market strategy.

• | Expand Existing Customer Relationships. We continue to expand our relationships with existing customers. For example, some businesses may initially purchase our solution only for their stores in a particular country with opportunities to expand to other stores in the geographic region. We also up‑sell additional features, such as Pages and Reviews, to existing customers, who generally start with our entry‑level Listings feature. See "—Sales and Marketing" for a discussion of customer retention and our ability to expand customer relationships. 


• | Expand Internationally. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to continue to expand the use of our platform outside the United States. We derived more than 14% of our total revenue from non‑U.S. sales in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 and we believe there are substantial opportunities to increase sales to customers outside of the United States as well as to help our existing U.S.‑based customers manage data for more of their international business. We have an established presence in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, Japan and China and we intend to further expand our footprint to other regions. 


• | Develop and Market New Products and Features. We are committed to developing and marketing innovative capabilities for our customers to meet their digital knowledge management needs. We will continue to invest in our platform and develop features to help our customers better control their digital knowledge. 


• | Extend the Knowledge Network. We plan to continue to expand our Knowledge Network. In the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 our Knowledge Network is comprised of more than 150 applications. We are increasing our focus on adding more industry vertical-specific and international services to our Knowledge Network as well as including new services that may become more commonly used in the future. For example, in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 we launched a global integration with Amazon to give businesses control over the answers Amazon Alexa provides about them. 


• | Expand Our Developer Platform. We opened up our Knowledge Engine to developers with the introduction of our Yext Developer platform. The Yext Developer platform offers our customers the ability to integrate into other systems to give them programmatic control of their organization’s digital knowledge. We believe that the introduction of our Yext Developer platform will further expand the ways that our Knowledge Engine can be utilized and increase customer retention. 

Key Benefits of Our Platform 
Our global Knowledge Engine provides the following benefits depending on a customer’s subscription level and enabled solutions and features:

• | Control over Digital Knowledge. Our platform is the system of record that enables our customers to control their digital knowledge and be the single source of truth for their information.

The Yext Knowledge Engine 
The Yext Knowledge Engine is our cloud‑based platform that powers our key features allowing customers to control their digital knowledge and the content of their landing pages and to manage their consumer reviews, all from a single login. From our Knowledge Engine customers can centralize, control and manage data fields, including name, address and phone number, map marker, holiday hours, location‑specific promotions, photo and video content and social links, use the data to power and update their local landing pages and make this information available through our Knowledge Network of more than 150 maps, apps, search engines, intelligent GPS systems, digital assistants, vertical directories and social networks in a complete, up to date and accurate manner. 
We offer our cloud‑based Knowledge Engine platform to customers on a subscription basis in several packages. Each package provides varying levels of access to our key features, including Listings, Pages and Reviews. Our Listings feature allows our customers to sync and update the content they store in the Yext platform across our Knowledge Network providing customers with greater control and consistency over their brand. Our Pages feature gives our customers the ability to create individual web pages for their locations, professionals or events, enabling control over the image and efficacy of their digital appearance on their own sites. Our Reviews feature enables customers to encourage and facilitate reviews, thereby increasing the quantity and quality of the reviews available to potential consumers and provides tools to manage their reviews from multiple sources across our Knowledge Network from a single location. Ultimately, these and our other features and solutions help ensure that the critical digital knowledge created by businesses and professional service providers and delivered to the consumer is accurate, consistent, up to date and compelling.
We continue to invest in platform and features development to help our customers better control their digital knowledge and have released new products and features to all of our customers multiple times a year. In November 2017, we introduced Yext for Events, a feature that enables businesses to manage the public knowledge about their events and create event pages and calendars. 
Our Technology
Our cloud‑based platform is designed to scale as we continue to add customers and allows us to support digital knowledge for the locations, persons and entities managed with our platform and the millions of associated attributes. The platform is built primarily with industry‑standard open source technology. We use a microservices‑based architecture to maximize the manageability, flexibility and scalability of our software as it continues to grow more complex. We also employ a modern continuous delivery approach to building, testing and deploying our software.
Hosting
The majority of our customer‑facing software is run from two co‑location data centers. To provide the highest level of up‑time and lowest latency for our platform capabilities, key high‑volume services are hosted by third‑party hosting services, which allows easier and greater scalability and provides for redundancy. 
Data Structure
Our Yext Knowledge Engine allows customers to collect, store and manage structured data, consistent with standards published by schema.org. Schema.org is an open and collaborative initiative launched by certain large search engines that defines the vocabulary and format for structured markup. Search engines like Google and Bing consume local data through structured markup placed in the underlying code of web pages.
We actively monitor and track the schema.org standards so that our Yext Knowledge Engine stores and publishes data in accordance with the most current schema.org specifications.
Interfaces with our Knowledge Network
We rely on integrations with each of the applications in our Knowledge Network that enable us to accomplish some or all of the following key tasks with members of our Knowledge Network:

• | search for existing listings and retrieve details about them, in order to match our customers’ digital knowledge to existing listing data;


• | claim listings and deliver updated digital knowledge content;


• | retrieve or get notified about reviews and allow review response; and


• | obtain statistics about traffic on listings to display to our customers in the platform.

Over the years, we have developed special integrations with a number of the applications in our Knowledge Network. We have also worked with the major application providers in the Knowledge Network to develop trust and strong working relationships, resulting in specific operational workflows, processes for issue resolution, and specialized technology and processes tailored to the nuances of each. For smaller Knowledge Network application providers, we have developed our own API specifications that each provider builds and implements for integration with our Yext Knowledge Engine.

Our Customers
As of January 31, 2019, we served businesses with locations in over 100 countries. These include many leading businesses in a diverse set of industries, such as healthcare, retail and financial services. For this purpose, we define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity, such as a company, a government institution, a franchisor, a service provider or agency or a distinct business unit of a large corporation that has an active contract directly with us. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.
Sales and Marketing 
We sell our solution globally to customers of all sizes through direct sales efforts to our customers, including third‑party resellers, and through a self‑service purchase process. We serve the significant majority of enterprise and mid‑size business customers through our direct sales force, while most of our third-party reseller customers serve small businesses or non‑U.S. businesses. In transactions with resellers, we are only a party to the transaction with the reseller and are not a party to the reseller’s transaction with its customer. 
Our sales organization varies by market within each country and will change over time as we build critical mass and address various verticals within a market. As of January 31, 2019, we had 173 quota-carrying sales representatives compared to 131 as of January 31, 2018. We plan to continue to grow our sales and marketing organization as we expand globally.
Through our direct sales efforts, we offer annual and multi-year subscriptions to our platform. Our pricing strategy generally varies based on the number of licenses managed by a customer through our platform and the level of service and features that a customer requires. Beginning in October 2015, we began pricing new subscriptions in a discrete range of packages, with pricing based on specified feature sets and the number of locations managed by the customer with our platform. More recently, we began pricing subscriptions based not only on the number of physical locations, but also on the number of persons and other entities managed on our platform, such as physicians, wealth advisors and insurance agents and events among others. We refer to these locations, persons and other entities collectively as "licenses," which we believe reflects the breadth of our business and our current pricing methodology. 
We categorize our current packages as Base, Starter, Professional and Ultimate, which start with basic access to the Knowledge Engine and successively include access to additional capabilities at a higher cost. Many of our customers initially deploy a Starter or Professional subscription to control and manage their digital knowledge using the Listings feature. Some customers start with the Base subscription if they only need internal data management. As customers realize the benefits of our platform, many have increased or expanded their existing subscription levels to obtain greater access to our key features, such as Pages and Reviews, as they need them.
We believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand the revenue they generate for us over time is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long term value of our customer relationships. We assess our performance in this respect using a metric we refer to as our dollar‑based net retention rate. Our dollar‑based net retention rate was 110%, 109%, and 119% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We calculate this metric for a particular period by first establishing a cohort of the enterprise, mid‑size and reseller customers who had active contracts at the end of each month of the same period in the prior year. We divide the single month revenue from each of those customer cohorts for the applicable month in the current year by the single month revenue of that same customer cohort for the corresponding month in the prior year. We then determine the dollar‑based weighted average of each of the monthly rates, and this average represents the dollar‑based net retention rate for the period. We only consider revenue from our enterprise and mid‑size customers, including third-party reseller customers, when calculating this metric since small businesses that have limited locations experience inherently high turnover. Our revenue from direct sales to small businesses represented less than 10% of our total revenue in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 and less than 20% of our total revenue in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017. As we primarily focus our direct sales efforts on our enterprise and mid-size customers, including third-party reseller customers, we expect our revenue from direct sales to small businesses will continue to decline as a percentage of total revenue.
Research and Development
Our global research and development organization uses and shares the same technology, platform development tools and data across various sites. Our research and development expenses were $36.1 million, $25.7 million and $19.3 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is an essential element of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark, copyright and other intellectual property laws, confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We also license certain third‑party technology for use in conjunction with our platform.
We believe that our continued success depends on hiring and retaining highly capable and innovative employees, especially as it relates to our engineering base. It is our policy that our employees and independent contractors involved in development are required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property and assigning to us any ownership that they may claim in those works. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent intellectual property that we own or license. 
9

Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.
Patents and Patent Applications
As of January 31, 2019, we had eight issued U.S. patents, seven non‑provisional and five provisional U.S. patent applications, two international Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications pending, and one national stage application in the European Union. The issued patents have expiration dates ranging from 2032 to 2035. Although we actively attempt to utilize patents to protect our technologies, we believe that none of our patents, individually or in the aggregate, are material to our business. We will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. However, there can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved, that any patents issued will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that such patents will not be challenged by third parties or found by a judicial authority to be invalid or unenforceable.
Trademarks
We rely on registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. As of January 31, 2019, we had 75 trademarks registered globally. “Yext” is a registered trademark in the United States and in certain other countries.
Competition
The market for digital knowledge management, particularly for location and location‑related data, is new and rapidly evolving, and we face many competitors with a variety of product offerings. Our primary competition comes from businesses that choose to handle digital knowledge management in‑house using manual, paper and spreadsheet‑based systems that corporate personnel employ in a fragmented manner rather than pay for a third‑party product or service. In addition, some small companies may offer products and services at lower price points than us or that compete with some but not all of the features present in our platform and solutions. As we introduce new features and our existing platform evolves, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition.
We believe that we generally compete favorably with our competitors because of the size and breadth of our integrations and relationships with the applications in our Knowledge Network, the features and performance of our platform, the ease of integration of our solutions with the technological infrastructures of our customers and the incremental marketing benefits and return on investment that our various solutions offer to our customers.
Employees
As of January 31, 2019, we had over 900 full‑time employees, the majority of which are based in our New York headquarters. We consider our culture and employees to be vital to our success. None of our domestic employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Additional Information
We were incorporated in 2006 as a Delaware corporation. Our headquarters are located at 1 Madison Avenue, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10010 and our telephone number is (212) 994-3900. You can access our website at www.yext.com and our investor relations website at http://investors.yext.com.
