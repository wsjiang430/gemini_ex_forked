CORPORATE HISTORY
 
Historical Business
 
flooidCX Corp. was incorporated on January 7, 2014 in the State of Nevada as Baixo Relocation Services, Inc. We previously operated a consulting business whereby we provided personalized relocation services to clients, both individual and corporate, who were relocating to the state of Goa, India. We assisted clients who intended to relocate to the region for temporary, long-term, and permanent periods. We offered a wide range of relocation services to our clients, including arranging and assisting with transportation in the state of Goa, India, household goods movement, appropriate immigration documentation, real estate rental and purchases, children’s’ education registration, area orientation, housekeeping, utilities connections, banking introductions, local transportation, tax compliance, and language and cultural training.
 
Changes in Control of Registrant
 
Dated May 31, 2016 and effective October 3, 2016, Rosy Rodrigues (“Rodrigues”), our former majority shareholder, and sole executive officer and member of the Board of Directors, entered into those certain stock purchase agreements (collectively, the “Stock Purchase Agreements”) with certain individuals and/or entities (collectively, the “Investors”). In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreements, Rodrigues sold and transferred at a per share price of $0.037 the control block of the Company consisting of 75,000,000 (post-Stock Split) shares of restricted common stock and representing approximately 62.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock, constituting a change in control. 
 
Name Change and Forward Stock Split
 
On December 9, 2016, the majority shareholders of the Company approved a forward stock split of fifteen for one (15:1) of our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Stock Split”) and a change in our name from “Baixo Relocation Services Inc.” to “Gripevine Inc.” (the “Name Change”). Pursuant to our Bylaws and the Nevada Revised Statutes, a vote by the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding votes was required to effect the Stock Split and the Name Change. An amendment to our articles of incorporation was filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on December 22, 2016 to effect the Name Change. Our trading symbol was changed to “GRPV”. The Stock Split was effected as of January 5, 2017 and increased our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock from 8,000,000 shares to 120,000,000 shares of common stock. 
 
Acquisition of MBE Holdings Inc.
 
Effective February 28, 2017, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “MBE Exchange Agreement”) with MBE Holdings Inc., a private corporation organized under the laws of Delaware (“MBE”) and the shareholders of MBE (the “MBE Shareholders”). In accordance with the terms and provisions of the MBE Exchange Agreement, an aggregate of 5,248,626 post-Stock Split shares of our restricted common stock were issued to the MBE Shareholders in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of MBE, thus making MBE our wholly-owned subsidiary. Our Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of the respective shareholders to enter into the MBE Exchange Agreement pursuant to which we acquired all the technology and assets and assumed all liabilities of MBE. This resulted in a change in overall business operations of the Company bringing potential value to our shareholders.

2019 Name Change
 
Effective March 18, 2019, we changed our name to flooidCX Corp. pursuant to Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation filed with the Nevada Secretary of State. The new CUSIP number for the Company’s common stock is 33974L 106, and the new trading symbol is FLCX. The name of the Company was changed as part of its rebranding, which better reflects its new business direction into the customer care and feedback solutions space – offering easy to adapt customer care and feedback solutions to enterprises of all sizes.
Acquisition of Resolution 1, Inc.
 
On May 17, 2019, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “R1 Exchange Agreement”) with the stockholders of Resolution 1, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“R1”), to acquire all of the outstanding shares of R1 in exchange for 10,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock (the “Acquisition”). R1 has developed a comprehensive customer care and feedback management platform, which is delivered as a cloud-based, software as a service solution. R1 was founded in August 2012 by Richard Hue, the CEO and a director of our Company. The Acquisition was approved by the independent members of the board of directors of the Company. 
CURRENT BUSINESS OPERATIONS
 
General
 
Our mission is to help businesses bring back the conversation with customers with innovative, simple to use solutions that empower both the businesses and customers to communicate and create positive outcomes. With the consummation of the R1 Exchange Agreement resulting in R1 being our subsidiary, we now offer a suite of customer relationship management (CRM) solutions that enhances and builds upon our initial offering, “GripeVine.” 
Market Opportunity
 
The CRM industry is based on the premise that existing customers can drive the success of a business. According to the Harvard Business Review, acquiring a new customer is anywhere from 5 to 25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one.[1] Further, the book, Marketing Metrics, states that businesses have a 60% to 70% chance of selling to an existing customer while the probability of selling to a new prospect is only 5% to 20%.[2] Statistics from Gartner Group support the assertion that 80% of a company’s future revenue will come from just 20% of its existing customers.[3] The CRM market is estimated at $200 billion, which alone includes approximately 270 billion contact center conversations.[4]
Products
 
We offer unified communications and collaboration online CRM solutions - GripeVine and Resolution1. We offer unified communications and collaboration online CRM solutions - GripeVine and Resolution1. In 2002, customers overwhelmingly chose voice calling to contact businesses, as compared to direct messaging. In 2017, contact via voice calling (16.1%) has largely been replaced by direct messaging (24.7%) and social media (34.5%).[5]

The following illustrates how these solutions work together:
 


GripeVine. GripeVine is a consumer-to-business platform that helps build a customer feedback-minded community, focused on transparency, mutual respect and open communications among like-minded customers and businesses – all working together – to facilitate positive outcomes. It allows for private messaging between customers and businesses for positive resolutions, so that businesses are not forced to communicate via the comments section. While functioning as a social customer experience platform for social customer service and consumer reviews, GripeVine differentiates itself in the following ways:
 

· | Pay-Wall Free – Rather than taking businesses hostage like other rating and review sites, GripeVine connects business directly with their customers without the worries of having to pay for such access.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Transparent – With a focus on sincerity, respect and open communications to build trust through transparency, GripeVine is the “go to” consumer-to-business platform, for many Fortune 1000 brands. 

 
Significantly, GripeVine’s platform creates an incredibly strong search engine optimization (SEO) presence. Once there are multiple posts about a business (usually 5 or more) from consumers who want to connect to companies, the GripeVine platform automatically creates a strong SEO with the key words, “[company] headquarters,” which consumers usually use to search for a company when they have a customer care or feedback issue. This then triggers GripeVine’s proprietary auto-notification platform that advises the businesses that (1) their customers are waiting to hear back from them on GripeVine with regards to customer care and feedback issues and (2) they can claim their page and directly connect with the customer “pay-wall” free.
 
Resolution1. Resolution1 functions as a cloud-based customer care and feedback workflow management platform, where businesses can manage the entire logistics of customer care, feedback or inquiries throughout their entire organizations. Businesses can respond quickly and accurately to customers, while keeping track of every customer interaction. The platform is designed to grow and scale, so that businesses of all sizes, from small to medium-size enterprises (SMEs) to large enterprises, can use this cloud-based customer care and feedback management system.

The Resolution1 platform offers the following features and advantages:
 


· | Leads from GripeVine – As GripeVine’s back-end customer care solution, Resolution1 has the capability to receive sales leads from GripeVine. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | AI-powered sentiment analysis and process automation – Resolution1 uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to automate standard repeatable tasks, enable more impactful use of data, and create tools that boost agent productivity and decision making. 
· | Reporting and analytics – Resolution1 offers robust analytics and the ability to build custom reports. This reporting also uses sentiment analysis on a business’s social sites, so that a business can quickly view how it is perceived on all social platforms. 
· | Case management – Resolution1 can ticket and track all incoming feedback, conversations and/or inquiries so that businesses can immediately see all commentary or social posts and track the case management and resolution process. This enables businesses to prioritize, categorize and assign cases to the right department and agent. 
· | Omni-channel support – This feature allows a business to enter feedback manually, as well as staying on top of conversations about the business in its social channels. A business can aggregate customer feedback and respond to social commentary through its multiple social channels, in addition to creating cases and messages directly from its social feeds into Resolution1’s case manager.
· | Build watchlist – The watchlist allows a user/agent to pin posts of interest from social sites for later review or to aggregate them for lead generation and/or other marketing opportunities. Users/agents can tag notes and share watchlist posts internally with other departments and team members, create custom notes and generate cases as required. 
· | Team collaboration – Resolution1 allows for collaboration across an organization’s teams and/or departments. People from beyond the immediate support team can be brought in to help resolve or join in the customer conversation all under a single application. 
· | Auto review generator – This feature allows businesses to solicit ratings and reviews from their customers, without them having to first register to do so. 

Pricing. Once companies claim their free Resolution1 platform, access is granted to their proprietary dashboard where they can communicate publicly or privately with consumers, keep accurate track of reviews and gripes, see their current ratings, launch resolution offers, and manage their overall online customer service channels across other social platforms. 
 
We will also offer paid company accounts, which will allow companies to access a more robust social customer service management system utilizing unique and proprietary features allowing them to scale the use of the system to suit their organizational needs. The paid accounts will also allow the respective company to have more control over its presence on the site and be provided access to tools for gaining market share within their industries thus expanding the channels through which they will receive and manage customer service feedback. Management intends that paid accounts will offer companies access to the customer commentary and sentiment on social media. Whether a company is large or small, there is tremendous value in being able to monitor social customer service conversations about its brand across multi-platforms under one dashboard.
 
Currently, Resolution1’s basic free subscription option is much more robust than other comparable paid solutions. Resolution1 offers bronze, silver and gold plans, which are currently priced at $9.99, $29.99 and $49.99 per month, respectively, which offer features comparable to much more expensive competitor packages.

Marketing Strategies
 
We are utilizing the freemium model approach - offering a robust “free” plan (a “freemium”) that allows small businesses to use the basic features of GripeVine and Resolution1. Management believes that this will allow the Company to rapidly gain market share, create brand awareness and increase conversion of the users to its tiered paid plans. 
 
Our marketing strategy includes the following:
 


· | Channel Partners – We plan to create joint ventures with non-traditional channels to showcase and offer our free version of our products. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) – Our innovative “drag and drop” APIs that easily integrates with popular applications such as WordPress (over 4 million websites) and WIX (over 150 million users) will allow us to broaden our reach and attract a strong user base quickly. 
· | Affiliate Marketing - Once business users are on board, we plan to launch our Affiliate Marketing platform to direct-sell to SMEs. Management believes that this sales strategy, coupled with our freemium model approach, can be a very effective low cost strategy, eliminating the need to create an expensive sales infrastructure. 
· | Value Added Resellers (VARs) – Through our partner program, we plan to offer trusted partners the ability to attract new customers and provide additional value to existing ones. By introducing the flooidCX suite of products to existing and prospective clients, our VARs will allow us to gain additional exposure to both SMEs and enterprise clients.

EMPLOYEES
 
We do not have any full-time employees; however, we engage approximately 12 individuals as independent contractors. The Company also has its President/Chief Executive Officer, Richard Hue, and its Chief Technology Officer, Mark Vange. These individuals are primarily responsible for all of the Corporation’s day-to-day operations. Other services may be provided by outsourcing and consultant and special purpose contracts.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
 
We have incurred $783,440 and $2,993,097 during the fiscal years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on research and development for the Company. None of these research or development costs were borne by the customer.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
Patent
 
On February 15, 2019, patent applications were filed in the United States and Canada for “Complaint Resolution System” – US 16/325,828 and CA 3034118. The applications, which are pending, claimed the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/375,027, filed on August 15, 2016, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/475,447, filed on March 23, 2017, for the “System and Method for Determining Metrics,” as well as International application PCT/CA2017/050965 filed on August 17, 2017.
Trademarks
 
We have trademarked certain of our logos and names. On October 16, 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a trademark for “Gripevine”, Registration No. 4,227,471, for classes 35 and 42, which primarily is for business data analysis and electronic data collection and use of online non-downloadable proprietary software for business purposes for third parties featuring the use of such proprietary software to collect, evaluate and analyze consumer complaints and assist third parties in the resolution of such complaints. 
 
We rely on federal, state, common law and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology and algorithms by entering into confidentiality and agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with third parties. 
 
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of patent pending applications, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our intellectual property. We will pursue the registration of our patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names in North America and in certain locations outside the United States. We believe that our registration efforts will focus on gaining protection of our trademark “Gripevine” name and logos among others. These marks are material to our business as they enable others to easily identify us as the source of the services offered under these marks and are essential to our brand identity. 
 
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the North America or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. 
 
Companies in the Internet, media and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We are currently subject to, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we may likely face claims of infringement.

COMPETITION
 
There are a number of established and emerging competitors in the broad market of customer engagement software. This market is fragmented, rapidly evolving, and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry in some segments. We consider the principal competitive differentiators in our market to include:

· | Ease-of-deployment and use; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Time to value realization; 
· | Enablement of customer communications across channels; 
· | Availability of self-service options; 
· | Data analytics and performance recommendations; 
· | Mobile and multi-device capabilities; 
· | Proactive outreach tools; 
· | Customization and integration with third-party applications; 
· | Brand recognition and thought leadership; and 
· | Total cost of ownership for the customer (including software updates, ongoing maintenance, and consulting and system integration fees).

 
Given the large number, disparate sizes, and varying areas of focus of other companies with which we compete in the provision of customer engagement software, we may not always compare favorably with respect to some or all of the foregoing factors. Most, if not all, of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources than our Company, as well as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger marketing budgets. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements. With the introduction of new technologies, the evolution of our products, and new market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. Pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses, or the failure of our suite of products to achieve significant market acceptance, any of which could harm our business. In order to improve our competitive position in the market, we must remain focused in our development, operations, and sales and marketing efforts on the evolving customer service needs of all organizations.
