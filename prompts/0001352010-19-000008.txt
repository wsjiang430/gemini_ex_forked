Item 1. Business
Company Background
EPAM is a leading global provider of software product development and digital platform engineering services to many Fortune 500 and 1000 customers located around the world, primarily in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. We focus on helping our customers thrive in a market constantly challenged by the pressures of digitization through our innovative and scalable software solutions, high quality business consulting and experience design, and a continually evolving mix of advanced capabilities, blending our engineering and technology capabilities with business and experience consulting to deliver true end-to-end value. We focus on building long-term partnerships with customers, enabling them to reimagine their businesses through a digital lens. Our industry expertise includes financial services, travel and consumer, software and hi-tech, business information and media, life sciences and healthcare, as well as other industries in which we are continuously growing.
 Our historical core competency, software development and product engineering services, and our work with global enterprise leaders in enterprise software platforms and emerging technology companies, created our foundation for the evolution of our other offerings, which include advanced technology software solutions, intelligent enterprise services and digital engagement. Our strategic acquisitions have expanded our service capabilities such as digital strategy and design, consulting and test automation. We expect our strategic acquisitions will continue to enable us to offer a broader range of services to our customers from a wide variety of locations.
Business Strategy
Our service offerings have been evolving to provide more customized and integrated solutions to our customers where we combine best-in-class software engineering with customer experience design, business consulting and technology innovation services. We are continually expanding our service capabilities, moving beyond traditional services into business consulting, design and physical product development and areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics and virtual reality. 
EPAM’s key service offerings and solutions include the following practice areas:
Engineering
Our engineering foundation underpins how we architect, build and scale next-generation software solutions and agile delivery teams. Our engineering expertise allows us to build enterprise technologies that improve business processes, offer smarter analytics and result in greater operational excellence through requirements analysis and platform selection, deep and complex customization, cross-platform migration, implementation and integration. 
We use our experience, custom tools and specialized knowledge to integrate our customers’ chosen application platforms with their internal systems and processes and to create custom solutions filling the gaps in their platforms’ functionality in order to address the needs of the customers’ users and customers. We address our customers’ increased need for tighter enterprise integration between software development, testing and maintenance with private, public and mobile infrastructures through our infrastructure management services. These solutions cover the full lifecycle of infrastructure management including application, database, network, server, storage and systems operations management, as well as monitoring, incident notification and resolution. We deliver maintenance and support services through our proprietary distributed project management processes and tools, which reduce the time and costs related to maintenance, enhancement and support activities.
We have deep expertise and the ability to offer a comprehensive set of software product development services including product research, customer experience design and prototyping, program management, component design and integration, full lifecycle software testing, product deployment and end-user customization, performance tuning, product support and maintenance, managed services, as well as porting and cross-platform migration. We focus on software products covering a wide range of business applications as well as product development for multiple mobile platforms and embedded software product services.

Operations
We turn our customers’ operations into intelligent enterprise hubs with our proprietary platforms, integrated engineering practices and smart automation. Developing a digital experience or product from end-to-end requires input and expertise from a variety of professionals with a broad range of skills. Our multidisciplinary teams and global delivery framework come together to deliver well-rounded technology solutions that bring competitive advantage to our customers. In addition to utilizing our dedicated delivery centers, which allow us to deploy key delivery talent, we work closely with leading companies in various industries to enable our customers to better leverage technology and address the simultaneous pressures of driving value for their consumer and offering a more engaging experience. 
Optimization
We turn process optimization into real transformation by using process automation and cognitive techniques to transform legacy processes and deliver streamlined operations that increase revenues and reduce costs for our customers. We rely on our teams, methodologies and tools to optimize every stage of software delivery for improved quality and better features with each release. 
We maintain a dedicated group of testing and quality assurance professionals with experience across a wide range of technology platforms and industry verticals, who perform software application testing, test management, automation and consulting services focused on helping customers improve their existing software testing and quality assurance practices. We employ industry-recognized and proprietary defect tracking tools and frameworks to deliver a comprehensive range of testing services that identify threats and close loopholes to protect our customers’ business systems from information loss. 
Consulting
Over the years, as a complement to our core engineering skills, we have added capabilities in business consulting to give us an agile, hybrid approach to the market. Our consulting services drive deeper relationships as we help our customers with larger and more complex challenges. Our industry, technology and experience consulting services are interconnected to deliver maximum impact for our customers. The functional business expertise of our professionals is supplemented by a thorough understanding of technology platforms and their interactions as well as application of data science and machine learning to deliver best insights into our customers’ business. 
Our technical advisory services help customers stay ahead of current technology changes and innovate, where innovation beyond technology is also delivered through collaborative workshops, challenges and new organizational models. 
Design
We apply design thinking to digital and service strategy, user experience and the product lifecycle with a focus on innovative design ideas and product development. Our digital and service design practice provides strategy, design, creative and program management services for customers looking to improve the user experience. 
We are continuously looking to strengthen and grow our design and consulting practices as evidenced by recent business acquisitions. During 2018, we acquired Continuum Innovation LLC, which will enhance our consulting, physical design and product development capabilities and Think Limited, which will enhance our global product and design offerings.

Global Delivery Model
We believe the development of a robust global delivery model creates a key competitive advantage, enabling us to better understand and meet our customers’ diverse needs and to provide a compelling value proposition. We continuously grow our delivery platform both organically and through strategically acquired locations and personnel with diversified skills that support our strategy. We had 26,760 revenue generating personnel as of December 31, 2018, which mainly includes our core information technology professionals as well as designers, consultants and scientists. 
We serve our customers through on-site, off-site and offshore locations across the world and use strategically located delivery centers to offer a strong, diversified and cost-effective delivery platform. Our largest delivery centers are located in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 8,242 IT professionals located in Belarus. The majority of these IT professionals are located in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, which is well-positioned to serve as a prime IT outsourcing destination given its strong industrial base and established educational infrastructure. Furthermore, the government in Belarus strongly supports the technology industry and encourages investment in this sector through various long-term tax incentives. 
Our locations in Ukraine and Russia offer many of the same benefits as Belarus, including educational infrastructure, availability of qualified software engineers and government support of the technology industry. As of December 31, 2018, we had 5,836 IT professionals in Ukraine and 4,438 IT professionals in Russia. Our delivery model has not been materially affected by the political and economic uncertainty in Ukraine and Russia to date. 
Our other significant locations with IT professionals are the United States with 1,787, Hungary with 1,337, Poland with 1,194, India with 1,053 and China with 470 as of December 31, 2018. 
Customers
We maintain a geographically diverse client base, which primarily consists of Fortune 500 and 1000 customers located in North America, Europe, CIS and APAC. Our focus on delivering quality service is reflected in established relationships with many of our customers, with 54.8% and 30.9% of our revenues in 2018 coming from customers that had used our services for at least five and ten years, respectively. Our sustained growth and increased capabilities are furthered by both organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We continually evaluate potential acquisition targets that can expand our vertical-specific domain expertise, geographic footprint, service portfolio, client base and management expertise. 
As we remain committed to diversifying our client base and adding more customers to our client mix, we expect revenue concentration from our top customers to continue to decrease over the long-term. The following table shows revenues from the top five and ten customers in the respective year as a percentage of revenues for that year: 

 | % of Revenues for Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Top five customers | 22.3 | % | | 24.0 | % | 28.4 | %
Top ten customers | 31.6 | % | | 33.9 | % | 38.4 | %

See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this annual report for additional information related to revenue. 
See Note 15 “Segment Information” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding long-lived assets and customer revenues by geographic location as well as financial information related to our reportable segments.

Industry Expertise 
Strong industry-specific knowledge, backed by extensive experience merging technology with the business processes of our customers, allows us to deliver tailored solutions to various industry verticals. Our customers operate in five main industry verticals as well as a number of other verticals in which we are increasing our presence. 
Financial Services. We have significant experience working with global investment banks, commercial and retail lending institutions, credit card and payment solution companies, wealth management institutions, fund operators and various other providers of financial services. We assist these customers with challenges stemming from new regulations, compliance requirements, customer-based needs and risk management.

Our capabilities span a range of platforms, applications and solutions that businesses in travel and hospitality use to serve their customers, capture management efficiencies, control operating expenses and grow revenues. Some of the world’s leading airlines, hotel providers and travel agencies rely on our knowledge in creating high-quality tools for operating and managing their business. Within this vertical, we also serve global, regional and local retailers, online retail brands, consumer goods manufacturers and distributors and online marketplaces. We deliver a wide range of services to retail and eCommerce customers from complex system modernizations to leading edge innovations in multi-channel sales and distribution. We have transformed organizations to use technology to expand and revolutionize their business models. Our services directly impact the consumer experience of our customers’ brands, and allow our customers to reach more consumers. 
Software and Hi-Tech. We provide complex software product development services to meet software and technology companies’ constant need for innovation and agility. We help some of the most prominent software brands in the world build, what we believe to be the best software. Through our extensive experience with many industry leaders in Hi-Tech R&D, software engineering and integration, we have developed proprietary internal processes, methodologies and IT infrastructure, which give us an edge when it comes to serving customers in the Hi-Tech and Software Product markets. Our services span the complete software development lifecycle for software product development using our comprehensive development methodologies, testing, performance tuning, deployment, maintenance and support.

Our personnel in Life Sciences leverage their vast technology expertise to offer deep scientific and mathematical knowledge to broad-based initiatives. Our Life Sciences solutions enable customers to speed research and accelerate time-to-market while improving collaboration, knowledge management and operational excellence. 
Emerging Verticals. We also serve the diverse technology needs of customers in the energy, telecommunications, automotive and manufacturing industries, as well as government customers. These customers are included in our Emerging Verticals, which are further discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this annual report. 
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our services through our senior management, sales and business development teams, account managers, and professional staff. Our client service professionals and account managers, who maintain direct customer relationships, play an integral role in engaging with current customers to identify and pursue potential business opportunities. This strategy has been effective in promoting repeat business and growth from within our existing client base and we believe that our reputation as a reliable provider of software engineering solutions drives additional business from inbound requests and referrals. In addition to effective client management, our sales model also utilizes an integrated sales and marketing approach that leverages a dedicated sales team to identify and acquire new accounts. 
5

We maintain a marketing team, which coordinates corporate-level branding efforts such as participation in and hosting of industry conferences and events as well as sponsorship of programming competitions. We have been recognized by many top global independent research agencies, such as Forrester, Gartner, Zinnov and HFS and by publications such as Forbes and Fortune.
Employees
Our employees are a key factor in our ability to grow our revenues and serve our customers. We have dedicated full-time employees who oversee all aspects of our human capital management process including a professional talent acquisition team whose objective is to locate and attract qualified and experienced IT professionals within various EPAM locations. It is critical that we effectively plan our short-term and long-term recruitment needs and deploy the necessary personnel and processes to optimize utilization and quickly satisfy the demands of our customers. As our business grows, we also focus on hiring and retaining individuals with appropriate skills to fill our executive, finance, legal, HR and other key management positions. 
At December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had a total of 30,156, 25,962 and 22,383 employees, respectively. Of these employees, as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, 26,760, 22,998 and 19,670 were revenue generating IT professionals. 
In our competitive industry, the ability to hire and retain highly-skilled information technology professionals is critical to our success. We believe the quality of our employees serves as a key point of differentiation in how we deliver a superior value proposition to our customers. To attract, retain and motivate our IT professionals, we offer a challenging work environment, ongoing skills development initiatives, attractive career advancement, and promotion opportunities thus providing an environment and culture that rewards entrepreneurial initiative and performance. 
We dedicate significant resources to the training, continuing education and career development programs of our entry-level and experienced IT professionals. We believe in the importance of supporting educational initiatives and we sponsor employees’ participation in internal and external training and certifications. Entry-level IT professionals undergo a rigorous training program that consists of approximately three to six months of classroom training, as well as numerous hours of hands-on training through actual engagements. This comprehensive program results in employees who are highly proficient and possess deep technical expertise that enables them to immediately serve our customers’ needs. For our mid-level and senior IT professionals, we offer continuing education programs aimed at helping them advance in their careers. We also provide mentoring opportunities, management and soft skills training, intensive workshops and management and technical advancement programs in order to support the development of middle and senior management through formal leadership training, evaluation, development and promotion.
Historically, we developed our base of IT professionals by hiring highly-qualified, experienced professionals from Eastern Europe and by recruiting students from the region’s leading universities. We have established EPAM delivery centers near many of these university campuses and we continue supporting the universities through EPAM-branded research labs, developing training courses and curriculum, providing teaching equipment and engaging students to identify their talents in information technology. Our strong relationships with these leading technical institutions provide us access to a highly-qualified talent pool. In addition, in recent years, we have been exploring additional markets, such as India, as a new source of talent. 
 We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees and our employees have not entered into any collective bargaining agreements (other than broad industry-wide agreements as required in certain countries in Europe and Mexico) or engaged in any labor disputes.
Competition
The markets in which we compete are changing rapidly and we face competition from both global technology solutions providers as well as those based primarily in specific geographies with lower cost labor such as Eastern Europe, India and China. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge, end-to-end solution offerings, reputation and track record for high-quality and on-time delivery of work, effective employee recruiting, training and retention, responsiveness to customers’ business needs, scale, financial stability and price.
We face competition from various technology services providers such as Accenture, Atos, Capgemini, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Deloitte Digital, DXC Technology, Exlservice, Genpact, GlobalLogic, Globant, HCL Technologies, HP Enterprise, IBM Services, Infosys, Luxoft Holding, Inc., Mindtree, Perficient, Tata Consultancy Services, Virtusa Corporation, and Wipro, among others. Additionally, we compete with numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate.

We believe that our focus on complex software product development solutions, our technical employee base, and our development and continuous improvement in process methodologies, applications and tools position us well to compete effectively in the future. 
Quality Management and Information Security 
We are continuously investing in applications, tools and infrastructure to manage all aspects of our global delivery process in order to manage quality and security risks, while providing control and visibility across all project lifecycle stages both internally and to our customers. We maintain processes and infrastructure to protect our clients’ and their customers’ confidential and sensitive information and allocate resources to ensure information security, cybersecurity and data privacy. We have made significant investments in the appropriate people, processes and technology to establish and manage compliance with confidentiality policies, laws and regulations governing our activities, such as the European Union data protection legal framework referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), among others. 
We focus on establishing stringent security standards and internal controls and meet the standards of ISO 27001:2013 and ISO 9001:2015. We are an ISAE 3402 Type 2 certified IT services provider. This certification is issued by an auditor in compliance with the globally recognized assurance standard. The certification, along with others we hold, provide our customers with independent third-party verification of our information security, quality management and general controls practices.
We have developed sophisticated project management techniques facilitated through our proprietary Project Management Tools, a web-based collaborative environment for software development, which we consider critical for visibility into project deliverables, resource management, team messaging and project-related documents. These tools promote collaboration and effective oversight, reduce work time and costs, and increase quality for our IT management and our customers. 
Corporate and Social Responsibility
We are committed to integrating positive social, environmental and ethical practices into our business operations and strategy. This commitment is key to our continual development as a business and drives value for our employees, customers, business partners, the community and other stakeholders. We practice the principles established in our Code of Ethical Conduct by making positive contributions to the communities in which we operate and championing corporate social responsibility efforts.  
Through our focused efforts in the areas of Education, Environment, and Community, we are committed to sharing the expertise and attributes of our highly skilled global workforce to effectively support the needs of, and positively add to the world at large and the communities where we work and live. By understanding our impact on local, regional and global communities, we strive to create positive change and opportunities in areas where it is needed most. Such efforts include our global technology education initiatives, through which we provide innovative, industry-relevant technology training and mentorship programs to students globally as well as through other technology conferences, seminars, and hackathon events where we encourage social innovation and jumpstart collaboration among our local tech communities.
We believe responsible stewardship of the environment is critical, and we take this responsibility seriously. We continually strive to improve our environmental performance through implementation of sustainable development and environmental practices. In addition, as an innovation-driven business, EPAM’s success depends on hiring the most talented employees in the industry. We are committed to respecting our employees' fundamental human rights at work. We similarly expect our suppliers, vendors, and subcontractors and all other third-party companies that comprise EPAM’s supply chain to respect human rights and to avoid complicity in human rights abuses. EPAM seeks to provide our customers with exceptional personnel, which includes people with varied and diverse characteristics, to drive the innovation and thought diversity for which we are known. We aim to continuously retain and supply a pipeline of qualified, diverse candidates to foster this goal.
Intellectual Property
Protecting our intellectual property rights is important to our business. We have invested, and will continue to invest, in research and development to enhance our domain knowledge and create complex, specialized solutions for our customers. We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. We require our employees, vendors and independent contractors to enter into written agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us, which assign to us all intellectual property and work product made, developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment with us. These agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us remains confidential. 
7

We also enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our customers. These customary agreements cover our use of our customers’ software systems and platforms as our customers usually own the intellectual property in the products we develop for them. Furthermore, we usually grant a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, transferable and non-revocable license to our customers to use our preexisting intellectual property, but only to the extent necessary in order to use the software or systems we developed for them.
Regulations
Due to the industry and geographic diversity of our operations and services, our operations are subject to a variety of rules and regulations. Several foreign and U.S. federal and state agencies regulate various aspects of our business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — We are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we operate, including export restrictions, economic sanctions and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-corruption laws. If we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures”.
