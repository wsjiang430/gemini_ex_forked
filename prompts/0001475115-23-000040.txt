Item 1. Business
Overview
Our mission is to bring the world together through live experiences, and since inception, we have been at the center of the experience economy, helping to transform the way people organize and attend events.
Eventbrite connects event creators - the people who bring others together to share their passions, artistry and causes through live experiences - with their audiences. Through our highly-scalable self-service platform, we enable event creators to plan, promote and sell tickets to their events. Our consumer-facing experiences enable event seekers to find experiences they love and serve as a demand generating engine for event creators. In 2022, more than 800,000 creators held over five million free and paid events using Eventbrite, issuing nearly 285 million tickets to consumers on our global marketplace.
Our event creators are entrepreneurs who express their passions and skills through live events. To meet creators’ most pressing needs, we are focused on delivering products that grow their audience reach and generate demand for their events. We are also investing in an enhanced event discovery experience for consumers. As more creators and consumers view Eventbrite as a trusted place for live events, we believe we can drive more ticket sales and enhance our market position as a leading live events marketplace.
The Eventbrite platform empowers creators of free and paid events. Creators of free events currently use our ticketing features for free, and we charge creators of paid events on a per-ticket basis when an attendee purchases a ticket for an event. Today, we derive substantially all of our revenues from ticketing services. We also offer premium marketing tools to help event creators sell more tickets, build their audiences and grow their businesses.
The global COVID-19 pandemic tested our mission, our company and event creators in unprecedented ways. While in 2022, events in our core geographies largely occurred without federal, state or local COVID-19 restrictions, our operations were notably impacted during periods of accelerating case counts, which led to temporary shifts in creator and consumer confidence and behavior. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 and its variants, along with other geopolitical and macroeconomic events, including but not limited to shifts in consumer behavior, inflation, labor challenges, increased labor costs, rising interest rates, economic recession and other factors, may cause creators to scale back events which could materially and adversely affect our paid ticket volume, and consequently our net revenue and financial results. We may implement mitigation actions in response to these factors, including further modifications to our operating strategies, which may have an adverse impact on our business.
Our Platform
We leverage technology to connect live experience creators with consumers looking to discover new things to do or do more of what they love. Our creator and consumer experiences are purpose-built to engage each audience and, collectively, connect them in ways to help maximize the business opportunity for creators and satisfy consumer demand.
Creator Experiences
Event creators are the heart and soul of Eventbrite, and we build our platform with their success in mind. Our self-service approach has allowed us to pioneer a powerful business model that drives our go-to-market strategy and allows us to efficiently serve a large number and variety of creators with minimal training, support or professional services. We are committed to continuing to enhance the performance of our platform for frequent creators who drive the majority of ticketing activity and launching tools that help them grow their ticket sales and audience reach, which we believe will propel long-term growth.
In 2022, we released new functionality to deliver improved reliability and usability for creators while positioning our platform for marketing and demand generation expansion. Eventbrite Boost, our suite of marketing tools, and Eventbrite Ads, our promoted listings feature, help creators drive audience growth and attract incremental creator spend to our platform beyond ticketing fee revenue. Powering additional ticket sales for creators via products like Boost and Ads strengthens the overall demand generation value proposition of our platform. As we continue to build features that drive ticket sales and help consumers find their preferred events, we believe demand generation will remain a key differentiator that draws both creators and ticket buyers to our platform.
Consumer Experiences
We aspire to be the trusted choice for event discovery by helping consumers find new experiences and connect them with others who share their passions. When consumers come to Eventbrite, we want to deliver a personalized, easily navigable experience that will connect them with events that resonate. To help us build the demand side of our marketplace, we are 
investing in enhancing event discovery, building consumer trust and optimizing checkout conversion. Eventbrite is already a meaningful source of audience growth for many creators, and we believe that as we engage consumers and scale the consumer appeal and audience of our marketplace, we will be able to drive more demand for creators, drive more ticket sales as well as grow our marketing tools business.
Our Technology
Our platform operates on a global scale, and is designed to perform consistently, securely, efficiently and reliably at high loads. Our platform supports transaction volume associated with high-demand and peak volumes, and handles millions of events each year. We are continuing to strengthen our platform infrastructure as we shift from a monolithic architecture to one based on microservices. We believe the microservices infrastructure we are building will improve our platform's overall velocity, scalability and availability and ultimately benefit our event creators. 
Human Capital
Eventbrite is committed to bringing the world together through live experiences, and we like to think about working at Eventbrite as the ultimate live experience. In order to continue building on our innovative self-service ticketing and experience technology platform, it is important that we attract, engage and retain talented employees. We strive to offer a competitive compensation and benefits program tailored to our employees' needs across our global locations. We also work to foster a diverse and inclusive culture.
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 881 full-time employees, of which 508 were in the United States and 373 were outside the United States. 
Compensation and Benefits Program
Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to drive our business objectives, help achieve our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary, cash bonuses, and long-term incentives in the form of stock. We believe that a competitive compensation program with both short-term and long-term award opportunities tied to the achievement of meaningful performance metrics, allows us to align employees with stockholders interests. In addition to our compensation programs, we focus on promoting the total wellness of our people through resources, services and programs that support the physical, mental, and financial health of our Britelings and their families. We offer a wide range of benefits, such as comprehensive health insurance, access to certified coaches and therapists, paid time off, paid parental leave, retirement plans and other support. We further support Britelings' wellness through our BriteBreak program, which was established in 2020 to increase productivity, mitigate burnout, and drive increased engagement and retention with designated days off once per month. With the change from a primarily in-office to a primarily remote workforce, we have enhanced our benefit offerings to include home office stipends and have built more virtual, rather than in-office, engagement programs.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
We believe progress as a society and as a company comes from proactively fostering diversity, equity and inclusion with tangible, evidence-based practices that we believe are key to attracting and retaining top talent. We are committed to hiring and retaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive team through initiatives that ensure we consider a diverse slate of candidates for all mid-level and higher positions and conducting audits to ensure pay equity.
We are also focused on supporting Britelings across the full employee lifecycle and have implemented programs and practices designed to promote inclusion and diversity, employee engagement and employee wellness. For example, to foster an increased sense of inclusion at Eventbrite, we are committed to hosting ongoing workshops, conversations, exercises and training to explore how we can create change in our roles to foster more diversity, equity, and inclusion. We also support employee “BriteBelonging'' groups, an important component of our culture, which help to build an inclusive culture through company events and education, networking and mentorship opportunities, participation in our recruitment efforts, and input into our hiring strategies. Further, we are using our platform and marketing channels to amplify creators that promote racial and social justice, equality, equity and civic action. To strengthen the communities we work and live in, we advocated for national policies that promote gender and racial equity including paid family and medical leave and advancing voting rights in the United States. 
Competition
The market for event management solutions is highly fragmented and is impacted by shifting creator and attendee needs and changing technology and consumer trends. We also compete with internally-developed systems. This competitive landscape provides creators and attendees with many channels to promote or engage with live experiences.
We believe that our competitors fall into four broad groups: internally-developed ad hoc systems that creators cobble together on their own; event management software vendors, who are typically dedicated to a particular category of events in a limited number of countries; smaller niche or regional providers, who are typically smaller in scale and have limited technology and feature functionality; and large technology companies who have added products in the events space and whose userbases have substantial event-related activity, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Spotify and Zoom.
With respect to each of these competitor types, we seek to differentiate ourselves by being an event technology platform first and foremost, and by leveraging the scale of our event discovery platform to more effectively connect creators with consumer demand to help fuel them sell more tickets and fuel the success of their businesses
Intellectual Property
Our ability to protect our intellectual property, including our technology, is an important factor in the success of our business. We rely on intellectual property laws, including trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents laws, in the U.S. and abroad. We also use contractual provisions and restrictions governing access to our proprietary technology, including the use of confidentiality agreements and assignment of inventions agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, and companies with which we conduct business. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - “If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate reduced revenue and incur costly litigation to protect our rights.”
Government Regulations
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, ticketing, payments, export taxation or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because global laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.
