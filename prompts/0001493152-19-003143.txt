All references in this report to “Corbus,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise indicates.
 
Overview
 
We are a Phase 3, clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat chronic and serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases with clear unmet medical needs by targeting the human endocannabinoid system (ECS). We are developing a pipeline of cannabinoid drug candidates which are rationally designed, synthetic, small molecule drugs which target the ECS to treat inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. Our focus on the ECS is backed by an ever-expanding body of knowledge on the biology of the ECS and its role as being a master regulator of inflammation and fibrosis. Our lead investigational drug candidate, lenabasum, is a novel, synthetic, oral, cannabinoid (CB2 agonist) designed to resolve chronic inflammation and halt fibrotic processes. We are currently developing lenabasum to treat four serious and rare chronic inflammatory diseases: systemic sclerosis (SSc), dermatomyositis (DM), cystic fibrosis (CF) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In addition, we are developing a pipeline of experimental drug candidates from our library of more than 600 novel cannabinoids targeting the ECS. Our pipeline also includes CRB-4001, a 2nd generation, peripherally-restricted, CB1 inverse agonist designed to treat organ specific fibrotic liver diseases, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We expect to initiate a Phase 1 study for CRB-4001 by the end of 2019.
 
Lenabasum selectively binds to CB2 in the periphery, which is preferentially expressed on activated immune cells, fibroblasts and other cell types, including muscle and bone cells. Lenabasum stimulates the production of Specialized Pro-Resolving Lipid Mediators (SPMs) that act to resolve inflammation and halt fibrosis without immunosuppression by activating endogenous pathways. These pathways are activated in healthy individuals during the course of normal immune responses but are dysfunctional in patients with chronic inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. By its binding to CB2, lenabasum drives innate immune responses from the activation phase into the resolution phase. CB2 plays a central role in modulating and resolving inflammation by, in effect, turning heightened inflammation “off” and restoring homeostasis. This has been demonstrated in animal models lacking CB2 as well as humans with genetic polymorphism in the CB2 gene, as these exhibit excessive inflammation and fibrosis in response to activators of the innate immune system.
 
Lenabasum is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 SSc study, expected to enroll 354 patients and be completed in 2020, a Phase 2b CF study expected to enroll 415 patients and be completed in 2020, and a Phase 3 study in DM that commenced in December 2018 and is expected to enroll 150 patients. In addition, we are conducting a Phase 2 SLE study funded by a grant through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) which is expected to enroll 100 patients. Open-label extension studies are ongoing in SSc and DM following the completion of the Phase 2 studies in these indications. Lenabasum has generated positive clinical data in three consecutive Phase 2 studies in diffuse cutaneous SSc, CF and skin-predominant DM. Lenabasum has demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability profiles in clinical studies to date.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, has granted lenabasum Orphan Drug Designation as well as Fast Track Status for SSc and CF, and Orphan Drug Designation for DM. The European Medicines Authority, or the EMA, has granted lenabasum Orphan Designation for SSc, CF and DM.
 
Recent Developments
 
On January 3, 2019, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Kaken Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Kaken), pursuant to which we granted Kaken an exclusive license to commercialize lenabasum in Japan for the treatment of SSc and DM. In consideration for the license, we will receive a $27 million upfront payment and have the potential to receive approximately $173 million in additional milestone payments. In addition, Kaken is obligated to pay us double digit royalties upon the sale of lenabasum in Japan for SSc and DM. As a result of the $27 million upfront payment, we will owe a $2.7 million royalty (which is 10% of such payment) to CFF pursuant to the Investment Agreement.
 
On September 20, 2018, we licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and market drug candidates from more than 600 compounds targeting the ECS from Jenrin Discovery LLC. In consideration for the license rights, Jenrin was paid $250,000 upfront and is entitled to receive potential milestone payments totaling up to $18,400,000 for each compound Corbus elects to develop based upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones. In addition, Corbus is obligated to pay Jenrin royalty rates in the mid, single digits based on net sales of the licensed compounds.
 
Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to business planning, research and development, recruiting management and technical staff, acquiring operating assets, licensing lenabasum to marketing partners and raising capital. Our research and development activities have included conducting pre-clinical studies, developing manufacturing methods, and the manufacturing of our drug lenabasum for clinical trials and conducting clinical studies in patients. Two of the four clinical programs for lenabasum are being supported by non-dilutive awards and grants. The NIH funded the majority of the clinical development costs for the DM Phase 2 clinical trial and is funding the SLE Phase 2 clinical trials. In cystic fibrosis, the Phase 2b clinical trial is being funded in part by a development award for up to $25 million from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, while the previously completed Phase 2 clinical trial in CF was partially funded by a $5 million award from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc., a non-profit drug discovery and development affiliate of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

Clinical Development-Lenabasum
 
Systemic Sclerosis (SSc)
 
Ongoing Phase 3 Study
 
In December 2017, we initiated a Phase 3 double-blind placebo-controlled multi-center international clinical study (“RESOLVE-1) in diffuse cutaneous SSc which is expected to be completed in 2020. The RESOLVE-1 is a multi-national study expected to enroll approximately 354 subjects. The planned duration of treatment with study drug is 52 weeks. Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive lenabasum 5 mg twice per day, lenabasum 20 mg twice per day or placebo twice per day.
 
The primary efficacy outcome of the RESOLVE-1 study will be change from baseline in modified Rodnan Skin Score (“mRSS”), a measure of skin fibrosis and a standard clinical trial outcome in SSc. Secondary outcomes of the RESOLVE-1 study include patient reported outcome of Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, the American College of Rheumatology Combined Response Index in diffuse cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (“ACR CRISS”) score, a novel composite measure of clinical improvement from baseline that incorporates change from baseline in mRSS, and lung function and forced vital capacity, % predicted. These same outcomes were evaluated in the Phase 2 study and are also outcomes for the ongoing open-label extension study.

Encouraging Data from Ongoing Open-Label Extension Study
 
Thirty-six subjects with diffuse cutaneous SSc received open-label dosing with lenabasum at 20 mg twice per day following 16 weeks participation in the preceding double-blinded placebo-controlled part of the lenabasum Phase 2 study. Patients had a mean of about 20 weeks off treatment from the end of lenabasum dosing during the placebo-controlled period before starting open-label dosing. Lenabasum was administered in addition to standard-of-care treatments for SSc, including concomitant immunosuppressive drugs in 92% of subjects.
Efficacy Outcomes
 
The modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS), the primary outcome for the Phase 3 study of lenabasum in SSc, improved by a mean (SD) of -10.7 in the 29 subjects who had completed 76 weeks open-label dosing at the time of data analyses, compared to baseline at the start of the Phase 2 double-blind placebo-controlled portion of the study. 87% of the subjects who received open-label dosing with lenabasum achieved a degree of improvement in mRSS (reduction ≥ 5 points) at eighteen months that has been previously associated with improved survival in SSc and 47% of subjects reached a mRSS ≤ 10 points.
 
The ACR CRISS score steadily increased steadily over time with lenabasum open-label dosing and reached a median of 99% at 76 weeks, with 50% of subjects achieving an ACR CRISS score of 100%. Patient-reported disability, function, skin symptoms and global assessment of health all improved from study start and start of open-label dosing. Forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted was stable during lenabasum treatment through month nine and a small decrease in mean FVC% predicted was seen after month nine in contrast to the natural history of a decline in FVC in the disease.

Safety
 
There have been no severe or serious adverse events (AEs) and no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities related to lenabasum in the Phase 2 study, and the safety and tolerability profile of lenabasum remains favorable after 18 months of dosing in the open label extension.
Positive Data from Double-blinded, Placebo-Controlled Part of Phase 2 Systemic Sclerosis Study
 
In October 2016, the Company reported positive results from the double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled portion of the Phase 2 study in diffuse cutaneous SSc. This part of the multi-center Phase 2 study evaluated lenabasum’s clinical benefit and safety in 27 subjects who received lenabasum and 15 who received placebo. Subjects had disease duration up to 6 years and were allowed to receive stable doses of immunosuppressive drugs during this study. Subjects were randomized in a 2 to 1 overall lenabasum to placebo ratio. Subjects randomized to lenabasum received 5 mg once a day (n = 9), 20 mg once a day (n = 9), or 20 mg twice a day (n = 9) for the first four weeks, then all lenabasum subjects received 20 mg twice a day for the next 8 weeks. Subjects randomized to placebo received placebo twice a day for 12 weeks. All subjects were followed off study drug from weeks 13 through 16.
 
The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate clinical benefit in all subjects who received lenabasum versus subjects who received placebo using the ACR CRISS score. Lenabasum out-performed placebo in the ACR CRISS reaching 33% at week 16 (p = 0.044, 1-sided mixed model repeated measures using rank transformed data) versus 1% for placebo. Lenabasum also outperformed placebo in the mRSS, the primary outcome for the Phase 3 study, with a mean improvement (reduction) of 4.8 points in mRSS at sixteen weeks.

Cystic Fibrosis (CF)
 
Ongoing Phase 2B Study
 
In January 2018, the Company initiated a Phase 2b study in CF which is being funded in part by a development award for up to $25 million from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and is expected to be completed in 2020. The Phase 2b multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study is expected to enroll CF subjects who are at least 12 years of age and at increased risk for pulmonary exacerbations. The primary outcome is the event rate of pulmonary exacerbations which is the average number of pulmonary exacerbations per subject per time period. Secondary efficacy outcomes include other measures of pulmonary exacerbations, change in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised Respiratory domain score and change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), % predicted. The study is a multi-center international study expected to enroll 415 patients. Subjects will be centrally randomized to one of three cohorts to receive lenabasum 20 mg twice per day, lenabasum 5 mg twice per day, or placebo twice per day for 28 weeks, with 4 weeks follow-up off active treatment. This Phase 2b CF study was designed with input from the Therapeutic Development Network of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Clinical Trials Network.
Positive Data from Phase 2 Cystic Fibrosis Study
 
In March 2017, the Company completed a double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in CF and reported positive results. The Phase 2 study evaluated multiple doses of lenabasum compared to placebo for the treatment of patients with CF. The 16-week study dosed 85 adult CF patients with baseline (FEV1) percent predicted ≥ 40%, who were enrolled without regard to their specific CFTR mutation or infecting pathogens and continued with all baseline treatment regimens.
 
Lenabasum successfully achieved the primary objective of the study by demonstrating an acceptable safety and tolerability profile at all doses with no serious or severe adverse events related to the study drug. Lenabasum cohorts showed a dose-dependent reduction in a number of acute pulmonary exacerbations defined as those requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics compared to placebo. Additionally, lenabasum caused a consistent reduction in multiple inflammatory cell types in sputum, including total leukocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages. Inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-8, neutrophil elastase, and immunoglobulin G, were also reduced in sputum by lenabasum in a dose-dependent manner. These patient data provide evidence of biological activity of lenabasum in resolving ongoing innate immune responses in lungs of CF patients and support the observed reduction in pulmonary exacerbations.

To date, the Company has received two development awards with total potential payments of up to $30 million from the CFF to support the clinical development of lenabasum in CF.
 
Dermatomyositis (DM)
 
Ongoing Phase 3 Study
 
In December 2018, we initiated a Phase 3 double-blind placebo-controlled multi-center international clinical study titled DETERMINE in DM. The DETERMINE study is a multi-center international trial expected to enroll approximately 150 subjects. The planned duration of treatment with study drug is 52 weeks. Subjects will be randomized to receive lenabasum 20 mg twice per day, lenabasum 5 mg twice per day, or placebo twice per day in a 2:1:2 ratio. The primary efficacy outcome at Week 52 will be American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism 2016 Total Improvement Score (TIS), which is a weighted composite measure of improvement from baseline in six endpoints, including Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity, Physician Global Assessment of Extramuscular Disease Activity, Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity, Health Assessment Questionnaire (patient-reported disability), Manual Muscle Testing, and muscle enzymes. Evaluation of key organ involvement – muscle, skin, and lungs, will be included in secondary efficacy outcomes. Change from Baseline in the Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Activity and Severity index (“CDASI”) composite activity score will be a secondary efficacy outcome.

Encouraging Data from Ongoing Open Label Extension Study
 
Twenty subjects with skin-predominant DM received open-label dosing with lenabasum at 20 mg twice per day following 16 weeks participation in the preceding double-blinded placebo-controlled part of the lenabasum Phase 2 study. Patients had a mean of about 31 weeks off treatment from the end of lenabasum dosing during the placebo-controlled period before starting open-label dosing. Lenabasum was administered in addition to standard-of-care treatments for DM, including concomitant immunosuppressive drugs in 85% of subjects.
Efficacy Outcomes
 
The CDASI activity score improved from study start by to -17.6 points at 12 months in the open label extension study (OLE). An improvement of -4 to -5 points in CDASI activity score is considered medically important, and 84% of subjects had improvement in CDASI activity score exceeding -10 points at 12 months in the OLE. Continued improvement was observed during the OLE in patient-reported global assessments of skin activity, skin symptoms, itch and hair loss and physician-reported global disease activity, physician assessment of extramuscular disease activity.

Positive Data from Phase 2 Dermatomyositis Study
 
In October 2017, the Company completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of the Phase 2 study in skin-predominant DM and reported positive results. The mean improvement (reduction) in the primary efficacy outcome, the CDASI activity score, an, was 9.3 points for lenabasum treatment versus a reduction of 3.7 points for placebo treatment (p = 0.04,2-sided MMRM) at sixteen weeks. Lenabasum also outperformed placebo in multiple secondary efficacy outcomes studied. Lenabasum was well tolerated with no severe or serious side effects associated with the drug. No subjects dropped out. The dermatomyositis trial was funded by a grant from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health to the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.
 
The single center trial enrolled 22 adults at a 1 to 1 ratio of lenabasum to placebo cohorts. At baseline, subjects in each cohort had a mean CDASI activity score in the severe range and skin symptoms in the extremely severe range despite background treatment with immunosuppressive drugs in 19 of the 22 subjects. Demographic parameters, CDASI activity scores, patient-reported outcomes, and use of immunosuppressive drugs at baseline were similar for lenabasum and placebo cohorts. Subjects received lenabasum 20 mg QD through week 4, then lenabasum 20 mg BID through week 12 with safety and efficacy follow-up thereafter through week 16. All subjects remained on their background standard-of-care therapy throughout the study in DM.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
 
In December 2017 a Phase 2 clinical study of lenabasum was initiated for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and patient dosing commenced in February 2018. The Phase 2 SLE clinical trial is being conducted by the Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence (ACE) program, which is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
 
The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial is being conducted in the U.S. and is expected to enroll 100 adult SLE patients with active musculoskeletal disease, which is the most common disease manifestation of SLE. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of four cohorts to receive placebo or three different doses of lenabasum for 3 months, with 1-month follow-up. The primary efficacy outcome assesses pain from active musculoskeletal disease, and secondary efficacy outcomes include other assessments of active musculoskeletal disease, overall disease activity using SLE Responder Index, SLE Disease Activity Index (“SLEDAI”) and British Isles Lupus Activity Group (“BILAG”) scoring systems, and patient-reported outcomes.

Lenabasum’s Unique and Novel Mechanism of Action as a Pro-Resolving Drug
 
Lenabasum is a synthetic, rationally-designed, oral small-molecule drug that selectively binds to the cannabinoid receptor type 2, or CB2, found on activated immune cells, fibroblasts and other cell types including muscle and bone cells. Lenabasum stimulates the production of Specialized Pro-Resolving Lipid Mediators (SPMs) that act to resolve inflammation and halt fibrosis by activating endogenous pathways. These pathways are activated in healthy individuals during the course of normal immune responses but are dysfunctional in patients with chronic inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. By its binding to the CB2 receptor, lenabasum drives innate immune responses from the activation phase through completion of the resolution phase. The CB2 receptor plays a central role in modulating and resolving inflammation by, in effect, turning heightened inflammation “off” and restoring homeostasis. This has been demonstrated in animal models lacking CB2 as well as humans suffering from polymorphism in the CB2 gene, as these exhibit abnormal immune responses and a propensity for chronic inflammation.
 
A key aspect of the body’s innate immune response is its activation phase when inflammatory cells are recruited to the site of tissue infection/injury whereupon these cells act to destroy the infection and/or repair tissue damage. The next phase in a normal innate immune response is its resolution phase, during which the nature of the infiltrating immune cells changes from pro-inflammatory to pro-resolving, the infectious pathogens are eliminated, residual cellular debris and immune cells are cleared from the tissue, and tissue repair processes are eventually halted when they are no longer needed. In chronic inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, the innate immune responses are “stuck” in the initial activation phase. This failure to progress through the resolution phase causes chronic tissue infiltration with inflammatory cells and chronic activation of healing processes that cause tissue scarring, or fibrosis. The key event that propels an innate immune response from its activation phase to its resolution phase is a “class switch” from production of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes to a family of SPMs (Figure 1) which include lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and marescins. If an innate immune response persists in the activation phase and does not progress through resolution, chronic inflammation and fibrosis can result, causing organ dysfunction, organ failure, severe morbidity and even death. There are hundreds of life-long chronic and incurable inflammatory diseases.

Figure 9-Lenabasum’s Mechanism of Action
 

Lenabasum is designed to restore immune system homeostasis, by harnessing the body’s own physiologic pathways to transition the innate immune response from the activation phase to the resolution phase. If the innate immune response is “stuck” in the activation phase, tissue damage, fibrosis and persistent infection are expected consequences. Endogenous progression of the innate immune response through its resolution phase has been shown to clear inflammation, stop fibrosis, and promote pathogen clearance. Lenabasum’s unique mechanism of action is different than anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit the production or functions of distinct pro-inflammatory mediators that initiate or are active during the activation phase. Activation of an innate immune response is necessary to clear infections, however drugs that interfere with the activation phase carry the risk of immunosuppression and may have other undesirable side effects. In contrast, lenabasum is designed to transition an innate immune response from its activation phase to resolution phase. Lenabasum’s CB2 agonist activity initiates a class switch in bioactive lipid mediators from inflammation-activating mediators to pro-resolving mediators. Lenabasum acts to impact and activate multiple pathways including:

● | Increase in production of SPMs and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, with a concomitant decrease in production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increase in production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, coupled with a decrease in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-fibrotic growth factors. 
● | Increase in influx of non-inflammatory macrophages with a decrease in influx and accumulation of inflammatory cells and pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts. 
● | Increase in bacterial clearance. SPMs stimulate production of bactericidal peptides, enhance phagocytosis and killing of bacteria by neutrophils and macrophages. 
● | Increase in apoptosis of inflammatory cells, including neutrophil and pro-fibrotic cells, including fibroblasts. 
● | Increase in clearance of apoptotic cells and cellular debris by non-inflammatory macrophages.

Effect of Lenabasum in a Human Model of Inflammatory Resolution
 
Dr. Derek Gilroy, Professor of Experimental Inflammation and Pharmacology at University College of London evaluated the effects of lenabasum in a clinical research model of inflammation and its resolution in healthy volunteers. In this model, inflammation was triggered in healthy individuals by the subcutaneous injection of heat-killed E. coli. Blood flow to the site of inflammation was measured with laser Doppler techniques. Suction blisters were generated over the site of inflammation, and cells and inflammatory mediators were measured in the blister fluid at different times after the injection of E. coli. In this study 22 subjects received either lenabasum at 5 mg or 20 mg twice a day or placebo prior to the procedure.
 
The data demonstrated that both doses of lenabasum exerted potent anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and increased the clearance of bacteria as measured by local endotoxin levels, both key determinants of inflammation. Controlling neutrophils is considered highly important for treating many diseases driven by chronic inflammation. In addition to inhibiting neutrophil accumulation, lenabasum also enhanced clearance of the injected bacteria. The data were published in January 2018 in the peer-reviewed “Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics” journal in a paper entitled: “Potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects of lenabasum in a human model of self-resolving acute inflammation. The findings in this paper provide additional evidence for lenabasum’s unique mechanism of action to modulate the trafficking of key harmful effector cells to the site of infection and injury without compromising internal host defense mechanisms, and instead enhancing it. This dual mechanism of action of lenabasum combines the inhibition of lipid mediators that normally reduce the immune system’s ability to clear bacteria with the inhibition of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators. This unique activity of lenabasum ultimately drives the inflammatory response down the pro-resolution pathway.

Figure 10- Lenabasum Increases Pro-Resolving Lipid Mediators in Humans
 

Figure 10- Lenabasum also Decreases Inflammatory Lipid Mediators in Humans
 

Data from this human clinical model demonstrated that lenabasum activates the resolution of innate immune responses and is the first experimental therapeutic shown to activate the “pro-resolution” pathway in humans. These results are consistent with previous findings from experiments that evaluated lenabasum’s effects in animal models of inflammation and support lenabasum’s potential to deliver therapeutic benefit in chronic inflammatory diseases as a first-in-class pro-resolution drug. The results identify the CB2 receptor, the therapeutic target of lenabasum, as a key link between the innate immune response and the endocannabinoid system acting as an upstream activator of the resolution of innate immunity. The top dose of lenabasum in this study at 20 mg twice a day is the same as the highest dose in the Phase 3 SSc clinical trial and the Phase 2b CF trial.

Clinical Development-CRB-4001 and other synthetic cannabinoid drugs
 
Corbus is developing CRB-4001, a 2nd generation peripherally-restricted, CB1 inverse agonist for NASH and other fibrotic diseases. CRB-4001 was developed in collaboration with and financial support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). CRB-4001 was specifically designed to eliminate blood-brain barrier penetration and brain CB1 receptor occupancy that mediate the neuropsychiatric issues associated with first-generation CB1 inverse agonists, such as rimonabant. Corbus also has a pre-clinical library of more than 600 molecules targeting the ECS for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. Corbus expects to commence a Phase 1 study for CRB-4001 by the end of 2019, intended to be followed by a NIH-funded Phase 2 study in NASH. We are also evaluating and characterizing our library of more than 600 compounds to select additional clinical candidates to move forward into clinical studies.
 
Market Opportunity for Lenabasum in Inflammatory and Fibrotic Diseases
 
There are many different chronic, serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases that could be addressed by treatment with lenabasum. Some examples of chronic, serious diseases characterized by inflammation with variable degrees of fibrosis include genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), myelofibrosis, lung diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans, and sarcoidosis and autoimmune diseases including systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, myositis, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, primary biliary cirrhosis.
 
In autoimmune diseases, four out of the five top selling drugs in the U.S. are anti-inflammatory biologic drugs which had total sales of $42 billion in 2016. These drugs however suppress the immune systems and thus leave patients susceptible to serious infections. Lenabasum, on the other hand, is designed to resolve inflammation without immunosuppression and is an oral pill, which potentially positions it as a front-line, first choice for autoimmune and other serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases.
 
Lenabasum Market Opportunity for Current Indications Being Developed
 
Autoimmune Disorders
 
Systemic Sclerosis
 
Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by activation of innate and adaptive immune systems, an obliterative, proliferative vasculopathy of small blood vessels, and fibrosis of the skin and multiple internal organs. Approximately 200,000 people in the U.S., Europe and Japan have SSc. The disease affects mainly adults (80% of SSc patients are women) with mean age of onset about 46 years of age in the United States and the majority of patients between 45-64 years of age.

19
--


A commonly used system classifies SSc patients into those with more wide-spread skin thickening (diffuse cutaneous SSc, about 45% of patients) and those with more restricted skin thickening (limited cutaneous SSc, about 55% of patients). There is significant overlap in the clinical manifestations for these two groups of SSc patients and no known significant differences in disease pathogenesis.
 
SSc can affect multiple internal organs in the body, including the lungs, heart, kidneys, joints, muscles, esophagus, stomach and intestines. Clinically apparent organ involvement that occurs in more than a third of these patients includes thickened skin, Raynaud’s phenomenon, esophageal symptoms, pulmonary fibrosis, restrictive lung disease, edematous skin, joint contractures, digital ulcers, and muscle weakness. Less frequently occurring, yet life-threatening manifestations include pulmonary artery hypertension (about 1 in 5 patients), cardiac conduction blocks (about 1 in 10 patients), and renal crisis (about 1 in 50 patients). In the U.S., SSc is the deadliest of the systemic autoimmune diseases. The median disease duration for an individual who dies of SSc is 7.1 years from the onset of symptoms. About 85% of deaths caused by SSc are the result of pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary artery hypertension, or cardiovascular disease, such as sudden death.
 
In SSc the innate immune system fails to transition from the activation phase to the resolution phase. Individuals with SSc who have interstitial lung disease have an imbalance of bioactive lipid mediators, causing a predominance of inflammatory mediators versus resolving mediators. The preponderance of inflammatory mediators correlates positively with the degree of inflammation in the lungs and negatively with forced vital capacity, a measure of lung fibrosis. Excessive activation of the pathways which cause fibrosis including TGFβ, myofibroblast accumulation, and production of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins are all present in SSc.
 
There is no cure for systemic sclerosis, and there are no FDA-approved treatments for this disease. Other drugs that suppress the immune system but are not specifically FDA approved for SSc are prescribed by some doctors, such as methotrexate, mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide. These treatments may be associated with significant side effects, such as serious infections.
 
We believe there is general agreement in the SSc community that an effective anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic drug would address a significant unmet medical need in SSc, especially a drug that is orally administered, can be used chronically with other commonly prescribed medications for SSc, and is not immunosuppressive. We believe such a therapy would be positively received by the market.
 
Dermatomyositis
 
Dermatomyositis (DM) is a serious and rare autoimmune idiopathic inflammatory myopathy with characteristic cutaneous findings. About 80,000 individuals in the U.S., Europe and Japan suffer from dermatomyositis. DM usually strikes adults, with most common age of adult onset between 50-60 years.

20
--


This systemic disorder most frequently affects the skin and muscles, and DM can also include interstitial lung disease/restrictive lung disease, arthritis, gastrointestinal and cardiac involvement. Inflammatory muscle disease associated with DM can cause discomfort and significant weakness of the proximal muscles of the arms and legs and of the trunk. Dermatomyositis can include damaging inflammation elsewhere in the body, for example: lung inflammation that leads to lung fibrosis and restrictive lung disease; heart inflammation that causes arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, and pericarditis, inflammation of muscles in the esophagus that causes swallowing problems or aspiration pneumonia, and arthritis. DM patients may have active skin disease despite successful treatment of their muscle and/or lung disease. The skin findings in DM can be disfiguring and are inflammatory rashes characterized by redness and itching in exposed areas of the skin, around the eyes, on the hands, and in a “shawl” distribution on the scalp, hands, upper back, and photo-exposed areas. Due to this chronic inflammation, patients with DM have an increased risk of malignancy, most commonly in older patients. By itself, skin involvement in DM has a large negative impact on quality of life, comparable to that of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and vulvodynia, and much higher than those of many dermatologic diseases. The pathophysiology of DM is consistent with a patient’s inherent inability to adequately resolve innate immune responses.
 
There is no cure for DM, a disease that continues to progressively worsen over time. Typically, people with DM are prescribed drugs that suppress the immune system. These treatments may be associated with significant side effects, such as serious infections. FDA-approved treatments for DM include systemic corticosteroids and adrenocorticotropic hormone analogue.
 
We believe that an effective drug that controls inflammation in the skin, muscles, and other organs will address a significant unmet medical need in DM, particularly a drug that is orally administered, can be used chronically with other commonly prescribed medications for the disease, and is not immunosuppressive.
 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
 
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypical autoimmune disease with a wide array of clinical manifestations, including arthritis, rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, pleuritis, pericarditis, kidney problems, seizures and psychosis and blood cell abnormalities. About 550,000 individuals in the U.S., Europe and Japan suffer from SLE. The musculoskeletal system is the most commonly involved system in SLE. Patients with SLE have an increased frequency of related autoimmune problems, such as Sjogren’s syndrome and antiphospholipid syndrome that require additional treatments. SLE may occur with other autoimmune conditions, such as thyroiditis, hemolytic anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura. Accelerated atherosclerosis among SLE patients is responsible for premature mortality.
 
The pathology of SLE involves chronic activation of the innate immune system by immune complexes, with activation of the complement cascade, increased production of type 1 interferons and other mediators of inflammation and resultant tissue inflammation and damage.

Medicines specifically approved by the FDA for treatment of SLE are aspirin, hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids (for example, prednisone), the corticotropin injection Acthar® and the immunosuppressive drug Benlysta®. Other drugs that are not specifically FDA approved for SLE but are often prescribed by physicians include methotrexate, mycophenolate, azathioprine and cyclophosphamide. These treatments may be associated with significant side effects, such as serious infections.
 
We believe that an effective drug that controls inflammation in the joints and skin as well as improves overall disease activity will address a significant unmet medical need in SLE, particularly a drug that is orally administered, can be used chronically with other commonly prescribed medications for the disease, and is not immunosuppressive.
 
Cystic Fibrosis
 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-long, progressive, debilitating, and life-threatening autosomal recessive disease. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the gene Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR). The CFTR serves as a central hub to modulate transport, trafficking, and signaling in cells. Given multiple roles of CFTR in cellular activation and homeostasis, mutation of the CFTR give rise to multiple disorders in respiratory, digestive and reproductive organs.
 
The current median life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients is about 40 years. According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 30,000 Americans and a total of 70,000 people in the U.S. and Europe suffer from cystic fibrosis.
 
The CFTR mutations lead to defective ion transport, with reduced chloride and bicarbonate secretion and sodium hyper-absorption, followed by water hyper-absorption, by airway epithelia and other cell types. The resultant reduced height of epithelial lining fluid and decreased hydration of mucus results in abnormally thick and sticky mucus, which obstructs the lumen into which the mucus is secreted and reduces mucociliary clearance of bacteria. The dysfunction in ion transport in CF patients is reflected in abnormal sweat chloride levels.
 
The negative effects caused by CFTR gene mutations are not restricted to ion channels, but also extend to dysfunction of the innate immune system. The nature of the abnormalities in CF are consistent with inability of innate immune responses to make the transition out of the activation phase and into and through the resolution phase. Bioactive lipid mediators (SPMs) that initiate the transition to resolution phase of innate immune responses have been found to be deficient relative to pro-inflammatory lipid mediators that initiate its activation phase, and this reduction correlates with poor recovery of lung function following an acute pulmonary exacerbation in children. The preponderance of activated neutrophils and pro-inflammatory macrophages in inflamed tissue, reduced neutrophil apoptosis, high levels of neutrophil proteases that reflect persistent neutrophil activation, reduced clearance of neutrophils by macrophages, ineffective clearance of certain bacteria such as P. aeruginosa, and excessive activation of fibrotic pathways all show the inability of individuals with CF to resolve their innate immune responses.
 
An overview of the disease progression in cystic fibrosis is provided in Figure 3.

Figure 11: Factors involved in cystic fibrosis progression
 

As a result of obstructing secretions, recurrent infections, hyper-inflammation, and activated fibrotic pathways in the lungs, individuals with CF develop bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, mixed obstructive/restrictive lung disease, and, eventually, respiratory failure. They may also have chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps. The same pathophysiologic events of obstruction, infection, chronic inflammation, and tissue damage/fibrosis occur in the gastrointestinal system, which can lead to bowel obstructions, fat malabsorption, bacterial overgrowth, gut dysmotility, malnutrition, growth retardation, low weight, pancreatic insufficiency, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, gallstones, and liver failure including cirrhosis. Adult males with cystic fibrosis have degeneration of the ductus deferens and sterility. End-stage organ involvement in cystic fibrosis is sometimes treated with transplantation, especially lung transplantation.
 
Current therapies for cystic fibrosis include mucolytics to breakdown mucus, antibiotics to fight bacterial infection, and drugs that act to restore some functionality to the faulty CFTR protein in patients, including Kalydeco® Orkambi® and the Symdeco®. Drugs that are designed to partially restore ion channel functions of mutant CFTR protein are not necessarily able to correct the dysfunction of the innate immune system. For example, ivacaftor treatment has not been associated with reduction in sputum neutrophils or neutrophil derived proteases in CF patients.
 
All CF patients appear to have dysfunction in resolution of the innate immune system, no matter which CFTR mutations a given patient has. This is borne out by the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations which according to the CF registry occur at an annual rate of 17,000 case per year and an event rate of 0.70 times per patient per year. A pulmonary exacerbation is acute worsening of the patient’s day-to-day signs and symptoms of lung disease and is associated with worsening of inflammation at the start of the exacerbation. Failure to resolve lung inflammation during a pulmonary exacerbation is associated with treatment failure, such as need to change antibiotics, prolonged antibiotic therapy, early recurrent of pulmonary exacerbation, and failure to recover lung function lost during the exacerbation. Pulmonary exacerbations in CF are associated with reduced survival, lung function, and patient quality of life and increased health-care burden. The annual average pulmonary exacerbation hospitalization related costs in the U.S. vary from $30,000 for a “mild” exacerbation to as high as $120,000 in patients with severe lung disease. Currently, there are no approved drugs used to address pulmonary exacerbations, a key driver of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis.
 
We believe there is general agreement in the CF community that an effective drug that will reduce hyper-inflammation and help reduce the rate of pulmonary exacerbations would address a significant unmet medical need in CF, especially a drug that is orally administered, can be used chronically with other prescribed medications for CF, is not immunosuppressive, and has anti-fibrotic effects.

Current Treatment Alternatives for Chronic, Serious Diseases Characterized by Chronic Inflammation and Fibrosis
 
Drugs currently used to treat chronic serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases are divided broadly into several groups: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), anti-malarial agents, systemic corticosteroids, and other immunosuppressive agents. The choice of agent or combination generally depends upon the underlying disease, and physician and patient preferences.
 
The potency of NSAIDs in the treatment of chronic, serious diseases, inflammatory and fibrotic diseases is often too limited to control disease activity, requiring patients to receive additional treatment with anti-malarial drugs, systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents. Anti-malarial therapy is used as a baseline treatment for chronic inflammation in certain autoimmune diseases, typically SLE and DM, especially in patients with milder manifestations of disease. Anti-malarial therapy is frequently ineffective in controlling chronic, serious inflammation, or can cause adverse drug reactions. Antimalarial-refractory disease is then treated with systemic therapies that may cause additional toxicity, including systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents.
 
Systemic corticosteroids are commonly prescribed for treatment of chronic, serious diseases characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, such as cystic fibrosis, SSc, and DM. Chronic corticosteroid use is limited by toxicities that include growth retardation, iatrogenic Cushings’s Disease, hypertension, high glucose levels/diabetes, obesity, brittle bones/osteoporosis, aseptic necrosis of bone, immunosuppression/increased infection, glaucoma, depression, and psychosis. Thus, safer yet potent alternatives to steroids have long been sought.
 
Multiple other immunosuppressive drugs are used to treat chronic, serious, inflammatory diseases, to achieve disease control and to curtail the need for corticosteroids. These include biological agents, such as monoclonal antibodies or fusion proteins, which target a very specific molecule in a key disease pathway. These drugs have several disadvantages including parental administration and increased associated incidence of malignancy and infection. Non-biologic immunosuppressive agents that are used to treat chronic, serious inflammation include methotrexate, mycophenolate, leflunomide, cyclophosphamide, and azathioprine, among others. Intravenous immunoglobulin is used occasionally to treat refractory chronic, serious inflammatory diseases.
 
Lenabasum As a Pro Resolving Drug with a Novel Mechanism of Action Has Safety Advantages versus Anti-Inflammatory Drugs, Steroids and Immunosuppressive Agents
 
Corticosteroids and NSAIDs exert their effect by inhibiting the activation of inflammation. In simple terms, both classes of drugs inhibit inflammation by “interfering” with the biochemical pathways in the cell that promote and sustain inflammation. For example, NSAIDs directly inhibit the activity of the COX 1 and COX 2 enzymes that are responsible for generating pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. A drawback of this approach is that it one arm of the eicosanoid pathway (e.g. COX but not LOX) is inhibited resulting in a build-up in LOX-derived inflammatory mediators which leads to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects (termed “molecular shunting”). Lenabasum on the other hand triggers endogenous pathways that resolves inflammation and halts fibrosis without immunosuppression Therefore lenabasum potentially offers a new and unique mechanism to treat a spectrum of rare, chronic, serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases.

Autoimmune Disorders
 
Systemic Sclerosis
 
Cytotoxic and immunosuppressive medications are used to control overall disease activity in SSc. In a one-year study of 2,739 SSc patients in the U.S., 44.3% received corticosteroids, 4.8% received mycophenolate mofetil, 2.7% received cyclophosphamide, and 0.5% received cyclosporine. In a report of 7,655 patients in the European Scleroderma Trials and Research Group database, the percentage of SSc patients receiving immunosuppressant treatments were: prednisone (43.5%) with median dose of 8 mg/day; cyclophosphamide (15.9%); methotrexate (13.7%); azathioprine (6.4%); mycophenolate mofetil (4.2%), d-penicillamine (2.1%), and rituximab (1%).
DM
 
Current medications for DM involve both treatments to reduce overall disease activity and specific treatments to control the muscle disease and the skin disease. The muscle component is treated by administering corticosteroids, typically with an immunosuppressive agent. The skin component of the disease is treated by avoiding sun exposure and by using sunscreens and photoprotective clothing, as well as with topical corticosteroids, antimalarial agents such as hydroxychloroquine and immunosuppressive medications such as methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or intravenous immunoglobulin.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
 
Similar to DM, current medications for SLE involve treatments to reduce overall disease activity and specific treatments for a given organ involvement. Commonly used medications include NSAIDs, topical corticosteroids, antimalarial agents, prednisone, belimumab, and other immunosuppressive medications such as mycophenolate, methotrexate, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide.
Cystic Fibrosis
 
The importance of treating inflammation in cystic fibrosis is confirmed in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation’s Strategic Plan, 2014-2018. While treatment with systemic corticosteroids and ibuprofen are effective in improving the symptoms of cystic fibrosis, the side effects associated with chronic treatment using these drugs are significant. Specifically, long term usage of oral corticosteroids in children are associated with glucose intolerance, cataract formation, multiple bone fractures secondary to osteoporosis or osteopenia, Cushing disease effects, and anorexia nervosa as well as growth retardation. The use of high dose ibuprofen is limited by the years of treatment it takes to show benefit, a need to monitor levels closely in the patient, and the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. As a result, these drugs have limited long-term use in cystic fibrosis.

25
--


Other therapies routinely used by cystic fibrosis patients routinely include antibiotics, such as Cayston from Gilead and TOBI from Novartis, and mucolytics, such as Pulmozyme from Genentech. In addition, Vertex currently markets the only approved drugs that specifically target the defective CFTR protein, Kalydeco, Orkambi and Symdeko.
 
Competition
 
For autoimmune disorders such as SSc, DM and SLE, physicians treat patients with a number of drugs including potent immunosuppressants and cytotoxics to try to reduce the autoimmune response characteristic of the disease. These drugs have not proven to be very effective thus there remains a high unmet need for safe and effective drugs to treat these autoimmune disorders. Several companies, including Boehringer Ingelheim, Galapagos, GlaxoSmithkline, Bristol Myers and Sanofi, are actively working to develop new drugs for treating the inflammation and/or fibrosis in SSc. To the best of our knowledge, lenabasum offers a unique mode of action to treat SSc being one of the few oral drugs with the potential to resolve inflammation and halt fibrosis without immunosuppression.
 
There are numerous drug therapies currently used to treat CF patients, targeting different aspects of this complex disease. Inhaled and oral antibiotics address the pulmonary microbial infection. Mucolytics address the accumulation of mucus in the lungs. Bronchodilators and hydration agents are also used to help improve pulmonary function. Targeting of the inflammatory component of the disease is currently done by high dose Ibuprofen and oral corticosteroids. While these offer some clinical benefit, they are not used chronically due to their adverse side effects which include immunosuppression and metabolic changes (steroids) as well as the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (ibuprofen). Thus, there is a clear and urgent unmet medical need for safe and effective inflammation-targeting drugs for the chronic treatment of CF that could potentially have a beneficial impact on morbidity and mortality. An emerging and growing area of CF therapy has been the development and commercialization of correctors and potentiators of CFTR by Vertex. Celtaxsys is developing an anti-inflammatory drug to treat CF which completed a Phase 2b study in 2018.
 
Research and Development
 
We incurred expenses of approximately $48,614,000 $ and $26,039,000 for research and development activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These expenses include cash and non-cash expenses relating to the development of our clinical and pre-clinical programs for lenabasum.

Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for lenabasum and to operate without infringing the proprietary right of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We strive to protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents and trademarks as well as through the confidentiality provisions in our contracts. With respect to lenabasum, we endeavor to obtain and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and internationally on all patentable aspects of the drug. We cannot be sure that the patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents issued or licensed to us in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property Rights.”
 
In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, aspects of our proprietary technology platform are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how related to the manufacturing of lenabasum. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 
We also plan to seek trademark protection in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. where available and when appropriate. We intend to use these registered marks in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development as well as our product candidates.
 
Manufacturing and Supply for Lenabasum
 
We have developed and validated a good manufacturing practice, or GMP, process to manufacture lenabasum active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and drug product through our contract manufacturers. Our existing API contract manufacturer has produced multi-Kg scale bulk batches under GMP for our on-going clinical studies and is under agreement to produce sufficient API required prior to submitting an NDA filing with the FDA. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of lenabasum. We expect to depend on third-party suppliers and manufacturing organizations for all of our clinical trial quantities of raw materials and drug substance. Lenabasum is a synthetic molecule and there are readily available supplies of all raw materials necessary for the manufacture of lenabasum.

Regulatory Matters
 
Government Regulation
 
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the US FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us
 
Any product development activities related to lenabasum or products that we may develop or acquire in the future will be subject to extensive regulation by various government authorities, including the FDA, other federal, state and local agencies and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, which regulate the design, research, clinical and non-clinical development, testing, manufacturing, storage, distribution, import, export, labeling, advertising and marketing of pharmaceutical products and devices. Generally, before a new drug can be sold, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. The data are often generated in two distinct development states: pre-clinical and clinical.
 
Development of Drugs in the U.S.
 
Lenabasum or other products that we may develop or acquire in the future must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States. For new chemical entities, the pre-clinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies that support subsequent clinical testing. These pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests are often performed under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices regulations. A drug’s sponsor must submit the result of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol to the FDA as part of an IND application, which is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug or biological product to humans. Similar filings are required in other countries.
 

29
--


The clinical stage of development can generally be divided into three sequential phases that may overlap, Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. In Phase 1, generally, small numbers of healthy volunteers are initially exposed to single escalating doses and then multiple escalating doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these studies is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action and general safety of the drug. Phase 2 trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits, common short-term side effects and risks. Phase 2 studies are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. Phase 3 trials are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 studies usually include from several hundred to several thousand subjects and are closely controlled and monitored. In addition to these Phase 1-3 trials, other trials may be conducted to gather additional safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information., Pharmaceutical products with active ingredients equal or similar to those already approved by the FDA often have more streamlined development programs than compounds entirely new to the agency, often skipping Phase 1 and 2 trials.
 
A clinical plan must be submitted to the FDA prior to commencement of a clinical trial. If the FDA has concerns about the clinical plan or the safety of the proposed studies, they may suspend or terminate the study at any time. Studies must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice and reporting of study progress and any adverse experiences is required. Studies are also subject to review by independent institutional review boards responsible for overseeing studies at particular sites and protecting human research study subjects. An independent institutional review board may also suspend or terminate a study once initiated. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
 
Post-approval studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. Sometimes, these studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic condition. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 studies. In other situations, post-approval studies aim to gain additional indications for a medication.
 
Special Protocol Assessment
 
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act directs the FDA to meet with sponsors, pursuant to a sponsor’s written request, for the purpose of reaching agreement on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in an NDA. If an agreement is reached, the FDA will reduce the agreement to writing and make it part of the administrative record. This agreement is called a special protocol assessment, or SPA. While the FDA’s guidance on SPAs states that documented SPAs should be considered binding on the review division, the FDA has latitude to change its assessment if certain exceptions apply. Exceptions include public health concerns emerging that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, identification of a substantial scientific issue essential to the safety or efficacy testing that later comes to light, a sponsor’s failure to follow the protocol agreed upon, or the FDA’s reliance on data, assumptions or information that are determined to be wrong.
 
Review and Approval in the U.S.
 
Following pivotal or Phase 3 trial completion, data are analyzed to determine safety and efficacy. Data are then filed with the FDA in a New Drug Application, or an NDA, along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the manufacturing and testing processes and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality. In the United States, FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before marketing a pharmaceutical product. The NDA must contain proof of safety, purity, potency and efficacy, which entails extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing.
 
The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of applications by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take several years to complete. The FDA may conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with current good manufacturing practice requirements and may also audit data from clinical and pre-clinical trials.
 
There is no assurance that the FDA will act favorably or quickly in making such reviews and significant difficulties or costs may be encountered in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals. The FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be including in the product labeling, or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. Further, the FDA may place conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur.

Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of regulatory review and approval process. In addition to the potential period of exclusivity, orphan designation makes a company eligible for grant funding of up to $500,000 per year for four years to defray costs of clinical trial expenses, tax credits for clinical research expenses and potential exemption from the FDA application user fee.
 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as (i) the drug’s orphan designation is revoked; (ii) its marketing approval is withdrawn; (iii) the orphan exclusivity holder consents to the approval of another applicant’s product; (iv) the orphan exclusivity holder is unable to assure the availability of a sufficient quantity of drug; or (v) a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by a competitor product. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. We have received orphan drug designation for lenabasum for cystic fibrosis and systemic sclerosis. There can be no assurance that we will receive orphan drug designation for lenabasum for DM, or additional orphan diseases.
 
Drug Development in Europe
 
In the European Union, our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Similar to the U.S., the marketing of medicinal products is subject to the granting of marketing authorizations by regulatory agencies. Also, as in the U.S., the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 
Review and Approval in the European Union
 
In the European Union, approval of new medicinal products can be obtained through one of three processes: the mutual recognition procedure, the centralized procedure and the decentralized procedure. We intend to determine which process we will follow, if any, in the future.
 
Mutual Recognition Procedure: An applicant submits an application in one European Union member state, known as the reference member state. Once the reference member state has granted the marketing authorization, the applicant may choose to submit applications in other concerned member states, requesting them to mutually recognize the marketing authorizations already granted. Under this mutual recognition process, authorities in other concerned member states have 55 days to raise objections, which must then be resolved by discussion among the concerned member states, the reference member state and the applicant within 90 days of the commencement of the mutual recognition procedure. If any disagreement remains, all considerations by authorities in the concerned member states are suspended and the disagreement is resolved through an arbitration process. The mutual recognition procedure results in separate national marketing authorizations in the reference member state.
 
Centralized Procedure: This procedure is currently mandatory for products developed by means of a biotechnological process and optional for new active substances and other “innovative medicinal products with novel characteristics.” Under this procedure, an application is submitted to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products. Two European Union member states are appointed to conduct an initial evaluation of each application. These countries each prepare an assessment report that is then used as the basis of a scientific opinion of the Committee on Proprietary Medical Products. If this opinion is favorable, it is sent to the European Commission, which drafts a decision. After consulting with the member states, the European Commission adopts a decision and grants a marketing authorization, which is valid throughout the European Union and confers the same rights and obligations in each of the member states as a marketing authorization granted by that member state.
 

31
--


Decentralized Procedure: The most recently introduced of the three processes for obtaining approval of new medicinal processes in the European Union, the decentralized procedure is similar to the mutual recognition procedure described above, but with differences in the timing that key documents are provided to concerned member states by the reference member state, the overall timing of the procedure and the possibility of, among other things, “clock stops” during the procedure.
 
Post-Marketing Requirements
 
Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and other federal and state regulatory authorities, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the products or labeling or changes of site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. The FDA regulations require the products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, and NDA holders must list their products and register their manufacturing establishments with the FDA. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with current good manufacturing practice and other laws. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms. These firms are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them.
 
Other Regulatory Matters
 
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. These regulations include:
 
● the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
 
● federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs that are false or fraudulent. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law or related to off-label promotion constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal false claims laws;
 
● the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and

● the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates”—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 
● applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act.
 
● The Lanham Act and federal antitrust laws.
 
● state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payer, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, traceability, and storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products
 
The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. In the U.S., our product candidate, lenabasum, is currently classified as Schedule I controlled substance as defined in the Controlled Substance Act (“CSA”). This designation is based on lenabasum’s chemical structure and pharmacology (namely, it being a synthetic endocannabinoid mimetic that binds to the CB2 receptor). Even though lenabasum’s mechanism of action is to modulate the immune system and results to date from clinical studies have demonstrated the drug has no psychotropic effects (which we believe is unlike other members of its chemical class), the DEA classifies lenabasum as a Schedule I substance.
 
Schedule I controlled substances are pharmaceutical products subject to specific regulations under the CSA, that establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. All parties responsible for the manufacturing, distribution and testing the drug in clinical studies must apply for and obtain a license from the DEA before they are permitted to perform these activities with lenabasum. Furthermore, these parties must have the security, control, recordkeeping, reporting and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. All licensed facilities are required to renew their registrations annually if they intend to continue to work with our drug. The DEA conducts periodic inspections of certain registered establishments that handle controlled substances. We have been working with our manufacturers, distributors, exporters and clinical sites to obtain the necessary licenses to work with lenabasum. The parties responsible for the manufacturing, distribution and export of lenabasum have already applied for and have been granted DEA licenses and a number of institutions responsible for conducting our current clinical studies have also been granted DEA licenses
 
Individual states have also established controlled substance laws and regulations. Though state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule drugs, as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug based on federal action, other states schedule drugs through rulemaking or a legislative action. The requirement for state registrations could also result in delay of the manufacturing, distribution of lenabasum or in the completion of our current clinical studies. We and our manufacturing vendors and clinical sites must also obtain separate state registrations, permits or licenses in order to be able to obtain, handle, and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions by the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.

Third-Party Payer Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any of our drug candidates that ultimately may obtain regulatory approval. In both the United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our product candidates, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including, in the United States, governmental payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. Medicare is a federally funded program managed by the CMS, through local fiscal intermediaries and carriers that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled. Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of patients whose income and assets fall below state defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government sets general guidelines for Medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program. Each payer has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product. Private payers often rely on the lead of the governmental payers in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable CMS coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product. The competitive position of some of our products will depend, in part, upon the extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement for such products and for the procedures in which such products are used. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payers.
 
The United States Congress and state legislatures may, from time to time, propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. For example, the two-year spending law signed by the President of United States on February 9, 2018 includes a provision raising the manufacturer discount to 70% in 2019 in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also known as the “donut hole.” Under prior law, manufacturers were required to provide a 50% discount on prescription drugs purchased in the donut hole. Manufacturers of branded drugs will face much higher liabilities from donut hole payments beginning in 2019, estimated at multiple billions of dollars for some of the largest companies.
 
The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payer interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms.
 
Some third-party payers also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably.
 
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.

Employees
 
We had 77 full-time employees at December 31, 2018. All of our employees are engaged in administration, finance, clinical, manufacturing, regulatory and business development functions. We believe our relations with our employees are good. We anticipate that the number of employees will grow as we continue to develop our product candidates. In addition, we utilize and will continue to utilize consultants, clinical research organizations and third parties to perform our pre-clinical studies, clinical studies, manufacturing and regulatory functions.
Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) December 31, 2019, (2) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (3) the date on which we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.
 
For as long as we remain an “emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and financial statements in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote to approve executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We are choosing to “opt out” of the extended transition periods available under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and intend to take advantage of the other reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.”
