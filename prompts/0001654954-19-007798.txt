  Corporate History
  
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 3, 2008 under the name “Multiplayer Online Dragon, Inc.” Effective November 5, 2010, we effected an 8 for 1 forward stock split, increasing the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock from 12,000,000 shares to 96,000,000 shares. On October 29, 2014, we effected a 1 for 10 reverse stock split, decreasing the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock from 97,000,000 to 9,700,000.
  
 On November 26, 2014, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with NaturalShrimp Holdings, Inc. a Delaware corporation (“NSH”), pursuant to which we agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets of NSH which assets consisted primarily of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of NaturalShrimp Corporation (“NSC”), a Delaware corporation, and NaturalShrimp Global, Inc. (“NS Global”), a Delaware corporation, and certain real property located outside of San Antonio, Texas (the “Assets”).
  
 On January 30, 2015, we consummated the acquisition of the Assets pursuant to the Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Agreement, we issued 75,520,240 shares of our common stock to NSH as consideration for the Assets. As a result of the transaction, NSH acquired 88.62% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock; NSC and NS Global became our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and we changed our principal business to a global shrimp farming company.
  
 In connection with our receipt of approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), effective March 3, 2015, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to “NaturalShrimp Incorporated.”
  
  Business Overview
  
 We are a biotechnology company and have developed a proprietary technology that allows us to grow Pacific White shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei, formerly Penaeus vannamei) in an ecologically controlled, high-density, low-cost environment, and in fully contained and independent production facilities. Our system uses technology which allows us to produce a naturally-grown shrimp “crop” weekly, and accomplishes this without the use of antibiotics or toxic chemicals. We have developed several proprietary technology assets, including a knowledge base that allows us to produce commercial quantities of shrimp in a closed system with a computer monitoring system that automates, monitors and maintains proper levels of oxygen, salinity and temperature for optimal shrimp production. Our initial production facility is located outside of San Antonio, Texas.
  
 NS Global, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns less than 1% of NaturalShrimp International A.S. in Europe. Our European-based partner, NaturalShrimp International A.S., Oslo, Norway, is responsible for the construction cost of its facility and initial operating capital.
  
 The first facility built in Spain for NaturalShrimp International A.S. is GambaNatural de España, S.L. The land for the first facility was purchased in Medina del Campo, Spain, and construction of the 75,000 sq. ft. facility was completed in 2016. Medina del Campo is approximately seventy-five miles northwest of Madrid, Spain.

 On October 16, 2015, we formed Natural Aquatic Systems, Inc. (“NAS”). The purpose of the NAS is to formalize the business relationship between our Company and F&T Water Solutions LLC for the joint development of certain water technologies. The technologies shall include, without limitation, any and all inventions, patents, intellectual property and know-how dealing with enclosed aquatic production systems worldwide. This includes construction, operation, and management of enclosed aquatic production, other than shrimp, facilities throughout the world, co-developed by both parties at our facility located outside of La Coste, Texas. On December 25, 2018, we were awarded U.S. Patent “Recirculating Aquaculture System and Treatment Method for Aquatic Species” covering all indoor aquatic species that utilizes proprietary art.
  
 The Company has three wholly-owned subsidiaries, including NSC, NS Global and NAS.
  
  Evolution of Technology and Revenue Expectations
  
 Historically, efforts to raise shrimp in a high-density, closed system at the commercial level have been met with either modest success or outright failure through “BioFloc Technology.” Infectious agents such as parasites, bacteria and viruses are the most damaging and most difficult to control. Bacterial infection can in some cases be combated through the use of antibiotics (although not always), and in general, the use of antibiotics is considered undesirable and counter to “green” cultivation practices. Viruses can be even worse, in that they are immune to antibiotics. Once introduced to a shrimp population, viruses can wipe out entire farms and shrimp populations, even with intense probiotic applications.
  
 Our primary solution against infectious agents is our “Vibrio Suppression Technology.” We believe this system creates higher sustainable densities, consistent production, improved growth and survival rates and improved food conversion without the use of antibiotics, probiotics or unhealthy anti-microbial chemicals. Vibrio Suppression Technology helps to exclude and suppress harmful organisms that usually destroy “BioFloc” and other enclosed technologies.
  
 In 2001, we began research and development of a high density, natural aquaculture system that is not dependent on ocean water to provide quality, fresh shrimp every week, fifty-two weeks a year. Our initial system was successful, but we determined that it would not be economically feasible due to high operating costs. Over the next several years, using the knowledge we gained from developing the first system, we developed a shrimp production system that eliminated the high costs associated with the previous system. We have continued to refine this technology, eliminating bacteria and other problems that affect enclosed systems, and now have a successful shrimp growing process. We have produced thousands of pounds of shrimp over the last few years in order to develop a design that will consistently produce quality shrimp that grow to a large size at a specific rate of growth. This included experimenting with various types of natural live and synthesized feed supplies before selecting the most appropriate nutritious and reliable combination. It also included utilizing monitoring and control automation equipment to minimize labor costs and to provide the necessary oversight for proper regulation of the shrimp environment. However, there were further enhancements needed to our process and technology in order to begin production of shrimp on a commercially viable scale and to generate revenues.
  
 Our current system consists of a reception tank where the shrimp are acclimated, then moved to a larger grow-out tank for the rest of the twenty-four week cycle. During 2016, we engaged in additional engineering projects with third parties to further enhance our indoor production capabilities. For example, through our relationship with Trane, Inc., a division of Ingersoll-Rand Plc (“Trane”), Trane has provided a detailed audit to use data to build and verify the capabilities of then initial Phase 1 prototype of a Trane-proposed three tank system at our La Coste, Texas facility. The Company contracted F&T Water Solutions and RGA Labs, Inc. (“RGA Labs”) to complete final engineering and building of the initial patent-pending modified Electrocoagulation system for the grow-out, harvesting and processing of fully mature, antibiotic-free Pacific White Leg shrimp. The design will present a viable pathway to begin generating revenue and producing shrimp on a commercially viable scale. The design is completed and was installed in early June 2018 by RGA Labs. The first post larvae (PL) arrived from the hatchery at the end of June 2018, and we expect to use the first harvest to market, sample, and refine production specifications by the third calendar quarter of 2019.

  Overview of Industry
  
 Shrimp is a well-known and globally-consumed commodity, constituting one of the most important types of seafood and a staple protein source for much of the world. According to the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service, the world consumes approximately 9 billion pounds of shrimp annually with over 1.7 billion pounds consumed in the United States alone. Approximately 65% of the global supply of shrimp is caught by ocean trawlers and the other 35% is produced by open-air shrimp farms, mostly in developing countries.
  
 Shrimp boats catch shrimp through the use of large, boat-towed nets. These nets are quite toxic to the undersea environment as they disturb and destroy ocean-bottom ecosystems; these nets also catch a variety of non-shrimp sea life, which is typically killed and discarded as part of the shrimp harvesting process. Additionally, the world’s oceans can only supply a finite amount of shrimp each year, and in fact, single-boat shrimp yields have fallen by approximately 20% since 2010 and continue to decrease. The shrimping industry’s answer to this problem has been to deploy more (and larger) boats that deploy ever-larger nets, which has in the short-term been successful at maintaining global shrimp yields. However, this benefit cannot continue forever, as eventually global demand has the potential of outstripping the oceans’ ability to maintain the natural ecosystem’s balance, resulting in a permanent decline in yields. When taken in light of global population growth and the ever-increasing demand for nutrient-rich foods such as shrimp, this is clearly an unsustainable production paradigm.
  
 Shrimp farming, known in the industry as “aquaculture,” has ostensibly stepped in to fill this demand/supply imbalance. Shrimp farming is typically done in open-air lagoons and man-made shrimp ponds connected to the open ocean. Because these ponds constantly exchange water with the adjacent sea, the farmers are able to maintain the water chemistry that allows the shrimp to prosper. However, this method of cultivating shrimp also carries severe ecological peril. First of all, most shrimp farming is primarily conducted in developing countries, where poor shrimp farmers have little regard for the global ecosystem. Because of this, these farmers use large quantities of antibiotics and other chemicals that maximize each farm’s chance of producing a crop, putting the entire system at risk. For example, a viral infection that crops up in one farm can spread to all nearby farms, quite literally wiping out an entire region’s production. In 1999, the White Spot virus invaded shrimp farms in at least five Latin American countries: Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Panama and Ecuador and in 2013-14 EMS (Early Mortality Syndrome) wiped out most of the Asia Pacific region and Mexico. Secondly, there is also a finite amount of coastline that can be used for shrimp production – eventually shrimp farms that are dependent on the open ocean will have nowhere to expand. Again, this is an ecologically damaging and ultimately unsustainable system for producing shrimp.
  
 In both the cases, the current method of shrimp production is unsustainable. As global populations rise and the demand for shrimp continues to grow, the current system is bound to fall short. Shrimp trawling cannot continue to increase production without completely depleting the oceans’ natural shrimp population. Trends in per-boat yield confirm that this industry has already crossed the overfishing threshold, putting the global open-ocean shrimp population in decline. While open-air shrimp aquaculture may seem to address this problem, it is also an unsustainable system that destroys coastal ecological systems and produces shrimp with very high chemical contamination levels. Closed-system shrimp farming is clearly a superior alternative, but its unique challenges have prevented it from becoming a widely-available alternative.
  
 Of the 1.7 billion pounds of shrimp consumed annually in the United States, over 1.5 billion pounds are imported – much of this from developing countries’ shrimp farms. These farms are typically located in developing countries and use high levels of antibiotics and pesticides that are not allowed under USDA regulations. As a result, these shrimp farms produce chemical-laden shrimp in an ecologically unsustainable way.
  
 Unfortunately, most consumers here in the United States are not aware of the origin of their store-bought shrimp or that which they consume in restaurants. This is due to a USDA rule that states that only bulk-packaged shrimp must state the shrimp’s country of origin; any “prepared” shrimp, which includes arrangements sold in grocery stores and seafood markets, as well as all shrimp served in restaurants, can simply be sold “as is.” Essentially, this means that most U.S. consumers may be eating shrimp laden with chemicals and antibiotics. Our product is free of pesticide chemicals and antibiotics, a fact that we believe is highly attractive and beneficial in terms of our eventual marketing success.

  Technology
  
  Intensive, Indoor, Closed-System Shrimp Production Technology
  
 Historically, efforts to raise shrimp in a high-density, closed system at the commercial level have been met with either modest success or outright failure through “BioFloc Technology”. Infectious agents such as parasites, bacteria and viruses are the most damaging and most difficult to control. Bacterial infection can in some cases be combated through the use of antibiotics (although not always), and in general, the use of antibiotics is considered undesirable and counter to “green” cultivation practices. Viruses can be even worse, in that they are immune to antibiotics. Once introduced to a shrimp population, viruses can wipe out entire farms and shrimp populations, even with intense probiotic applications.
  
 Our primary solution against infectious agents is our “Vibrio Suppression Technology”. We believe this system creates higher sustainable densities, consistent production, improved growth and survival rates and improved food conversion without the use of antibiotics, probiotics or unhealthy anti-microbial chemicals. Vibrio Suppression Technology helps to exclude and suppress harmful organisms that usually destroy “BioFloc” and other enclosed technologies.
  
  Automated Monitoring and Control System
  
 The Company’s “Automated Monitoring and Control System” uses individual tank monitors to automatically control the feeding, oxygenation, and temperature of each of the facility tanks independently. In addition, a facility computer running custom software communicates with each of the controllers and performs additional data acquisition functions that can report back to a supervisory computer from anywhere in the world. These computer-automated water controls optimize the growing conditions for the shrimp as they mature to harvest size, providing a disease-resistant production environment.
  
 The principal theories behind the Company’s system are characterized as:
  
   ●
 High-density shrimp production

   ●
 Weekly production

   ●
 Natural ecology system

   ●
 Regional production

   ●
 Regional distribution

 
 These principles form the foundation for the Company and our potential distributors so that consumers can be provided with continuous volumes of live and fresh shrimp at competitive prices.
  
  Research and Development
  
 In 2001, we began research and development (R&D) of a high density, natural aquaculture system that is not dependent on ocean water to provide quality, fresh shrimp every week, fifty-two weeks per year. Our initial system was successful, but the Company determined that it would not be economically feasible due to high operating costs. Over the next several years, using the knowledge we gained from the first R&D system, we developed a shrimp production system that eliminated the high costs associated with the previous system. We have continued to refine this technology, eliminating bacteria and other problems that affect enclosed systems and now have a successful shrimp growing process.
  
 We have produced thousands of pounds of shrimp over the last few years in order to develop a design that will consistently produce quality shrimp that grow to a large size at a specific rate of growth. This included experimenting with various types of natural live and synthesized feed supplies before selecting the most appropriate nutritious and reliable combination. It also included utilizing monitoring and control automation equipment to minimize labor costs and to provide the necessary oversight for proper regulation of the shrimp environment.

 After the implementation of the first R&D facility in La Coste, Texas, we have also made significant improvements that minimize the transfer of shrimp, which will reduce shrimp stress and labor costs. Our current system consists of a reception tank where the shrimp are acclimated, then moved to a larger grow-out tank for the rest of the twenty-four week cycle.
  
 On September 7, 2016, we entered into a Letter of Commitment with Trane, Inc. (“Trane”), a division of Ingersoll-Rand Plc, whereby Trane shall proceed with a detailed audit to use data to verify the capabilities of an initial Phase 1 prototype of a Trane-proposed three tank system at our La Coste, Texas facility. The prototype consists of a modified Electrocoagulation (EC) system for the human grow-out, harvesting and processing of fully mature, antibiotic-free Pacific White Leg shrimp. Trane was authorized to proceed with such detailed audit to utilize data for purposes of verifying the capabilities of the EC system, including the ammonia and chlorine capture and sequestering and pathogen kill. The detailed audit delivered (i) a report on the inspection of the existing infrastructure determining if proper fit, adequate security, acceptable utility service, environmental protection and equipment sizing are achievable; (ii) provide firm fixed pricing for the EC system, electrode selection and supply, waste removal, ventilation of the off-gassing of the equipment; and (iii) a formalized plan for commissioning and on-site investigation of hardware design to simplify build-out of Phase 2 and future phases. The detailed audit was utilized by RGA Labs to build and install the initial system in La Coste, Texas pilot plant the first week of June 2018. Based on the results of the initial system, we intend to increase shrimp production in our plant in La Coste, Texas by adding and stocking additional tanks and adding needed filtration equipment with plans to stock the entire facility by the end of 2019. Five new electrocoagulation systems have been purchased to update the La Coste plant.
  
  Target Markets and Sales Price
  
 Our goal is to establish production systems and distribution centers in metropolitan areas of the United States, as well as international distribution networks through joint venture partnerships throughout the world. This should allow the Company to capture a significant portion of world shrimp sales by offering locally grown, environmentally “green,” naturally grown, fresh shrimp at competitive wholesale prices.
  
 The United States population is approximately 325 million people with an annual shrimp consumption of 1.7 billion pounds, of which less than 400 million pounds are domestically produced. According to IndexMundi.com, the wholesale price for frozen, commodity grade shrimp has risen 15% since January 2015 (shell-on headless, 26-30 count; which is comparable to our target growth size). With world shrimp problems, this price is expected to rise more in the next few years.
  
 We strive to build a profitable global shrimp production company. We believe our foundational advantage is that we can deliver fresh, organically grown, gourmet-grade shrimp, 52 weeks per year to retail and wholesale buyers in major market areas at competitive, yet premium prices. By locating regional production and distribution centers in close proximity to consumer demand, we can provide a fresh product to customers within 24 hours after harvest, which is unique in the shrimp industry. We can be the “first to market” and perhaps “sole weekly provider” of fresh shrimp and capture as much market share as production capacity can support.
  
 For those customers that want a frozen product, we may be able to provide this in the near future and the product will still be differentiated as a “naturally grown, sustainable seafood” that will meet the increasing demand of socially conscious consumers.
  
 Our patented technology and eco-friendly, bio-secure production processes enable the delivery of a chemical and antibiotic free, locally grown product that lives up to the Company’s mantra: “Always Fresh, Always Natural,” thereby solving the issue of “unsafe” imported seafood.

  Product Description
  
 Nearly all of the shrimp consumed today are shipped frozen. Shrimp are typically frozen from six to twenty-four months before consumption. Our system is designed to harvest a different tank each week, which provides for fresh shrimp throughout the year. We strive to create a niche market of “Always Fresh, Always Natural” shrimp. As opposed to many of the foreign shrimp farms, we can also claim that our product is 100% free of antibiotics. The ability to grow shrimp locally, year round allows us to provide this high-end product to specialty grocery stores and upscale restaurants throughout the world. We rotate the stocking and harvesting of our tanks each week, which allows for weekly shrimp harvests. Our product is free of all pollutants and is fed only all-natural feeds.
  
 The seafood industry lacks a consistent “Source Verification” method to track seafood products as they move through countries and customs procedures. With worldwide overfishing leading to declining shrimp freshness and sustainability around the world, it is vital for shrimp providers to be able to realistically identify the source of their product. We have well-managed, sustainable facilities that are able to track shrimp from hatchery to plate using environmentally responsible methods.
  
  Shrimp Growth Period
  
 Our production system is designed to produce shrimp at a harvest size of twenty-one to twenty-five shrimp per pound in a period of twenty-four weeks. The Company currently purchases post-larva shrimp that are approximately ten days old (PL 10). In the future, we plan to build our own hatcheries to control the supply of shrimp to each of our facilities. Our full-scale production systems include grow-out and nursery tanks, projected to produce fresh shrimp fifty-two weeks per year.
 Distribution and Marketing
  
 We plan to build these environmentally “green” production systems near major metropolitan areas of the United States. Today, we have one pilot production facility in La Coste, Texas (near San Antonio) and plan to begin construction of a full-scale production facility in La Coste and plans for Nevada and New York. Over the next five years, our plan is to increase construction of new facilities each year. In the fifth year, we plan for a new system to be completed each month, expanding first into the largest shrimp consumption markets of the United States.
  
 Because our system is enclosed and also indoors, it is not affected by weather or climate and does not depend on ocean proximity. As such, we believe we will be able to provide, naturally grown, high-quality, fresh shrimp to major market customers each week. This will allow distribution companies to leverage their existing customer relationships by offering an uninterrupted supply of high quality, fresh and locally grown shrimp. We plan to sell and distribute the vast majority of our shrimp production through distributors which have established customers and sufficient capacity to deliver a fresh product within hours following harvest. We believe we have the added advantage of being able to market our shrimp as fresh, natural and locally grown using sustainable, eco-friendly technology, a key differentiation from all existing shrimp producers. Furthermore, we believe that our ability to advertise our product in this manner along with the fact that it is a locally grown product, provides us with a marketing advantage over the competition. We expect to utilize distributors that currently supply fresh seafood to upscale restaurants, country clubs, specialty super markets and retail stores whose clientele expect and appreciate fresh, natural products.
  
  Harvesting, Packaging and Shipment
  
 Each location is projected to include production, harvesting/processing and a general shipping and receiving area, in addition to warehousing space for storage of necessary supplies and products required to grow, harvest, package and otherwise make ready for delivery, a fresh shrimp crop on a weekly basis to consumers in each individual market area within 24 hours following harvest.

 The seafood industry lacks a consistent source verification method to track seafood products as they move through countries and customs procedures. With worldwide overfishing leading to declining shrimp freshness and sustainability around the world, it is vital for shrimp providers to be able to realistically identify the source of their product. Our future facilities are expected to be designed to track shrimp from hatchery to plate using environmentally responsible methods.
  
  International
  
 We own one hundred percent of NaturalShrimp Global, Inc. which was formed to create international partnerships. Each international partnership is expected to use the Company’s proprietary technology to penetrate shrimp markets throughout the world utilizing existing food service distribution channels. NaturalShrimp Global, Inc., owns a percentage of NaturalShrimp International A.S. in Oslo, Norway. As our European-based partner, NaturalShrimp International A.S. is responsible for the construction cost of their facility and initial operating capital.
  
 The first facility built in Spain for NaturalShrimp International A.S. is GambaNatural de España, S.L. The land for the first facility was purchased in Medina del Campo, Spain and construction of the 75,000 sq. ft. facility was completed in 2016. Medina del Campo is approximately seventy-five miles northwest of Madrid, Spain.
   Go to Market Strategy and Execution
  
 Our strategy is to develop regional production and distribution centers near major metropolitan areas throughout the United States and internationally. Today, we have 53,000 sq. ft. of R&D facilities, which includes, a pilot production system, greenhouse/reservoirs and utility buildings in La Coste, TX (near San Antonio). We intend to begin construction of a new free-standing facility with the next generation shrimp production system in place on the property in 2019.
  
 The reasoning behind building additional shrimp production systems in La Coste is availability of trained production personnel, our research and development team, and an opportunity to develop the footprint and model for additional facilities. Our current plan is to develop six regional production and distribution centers near major markets in 2019, adding one system per month in a selected production center, depending on market demand.
  
 We have sold product to restaurants at $12.00 per pound and to retail consumers at $16.50 to $21.00 per pound, depending on size, which helps to validate our pricing strategy. Additionally, from 2011 to 2013, we had two successful North Texas test markets which distributed thousands of pounds of fresh product to customers within 24 hours following harvest. The fresh product was priced from $8.40 to $12.00 per pound wholesale, heads on, net price to the Company.
  
  Current Systems and Expansion
  
 The pilot plant is located in La Coste, Texas and is being retrofitted with new patent-pending technology that the Company has been developing with Trane’s engineering audit and F&T Water Solutions, and RGA Labs. This facility, when completely retrofitted with the new technology, is projected to produce approximately 6,000 pounds every month. The next facility in La Coste will be substantially larger than the current system. The target yield of shrimp for the new facility will be approximately 6,000 pounds per week. Both facilities combined are projected to produce over 7,000 pounds of shrimp per week in La Coste. By staging the stocking and harvests from tank to tank, it enables us to produce weekly and therefore deliver fresh shrimp every week.
  
 After the completion of the next system in La Coste, our long-term plan is to build additional production systems in Las Vegas, and New York. These locations are targeted to begin construction in fiscal 2020, and the funding for these plans is projected to come from joint venture agreements with strategic partners. These cities are not surrounded by commercial shrimp production, and we believe there will be a high demand for fresh shrimp in all of these locations. In addition, the Company will continue to use the land it owns in La Coste to build as many systems as the Texas market demands.

  Competition
  
 There are a number of companies conducting research and development projects in their attempt to develop closed-system technologies in the U.S., some with reported production and sales. Florida Organic Aquaculture uses a Bio-Floc Raceway System to intensify shrimp growth, while Marvesta Shrimp Farms’ tanks in water from the Atlantic to use in their indoor system. Since these are privately-held companies, it is not possible to know, with certainty, their state of technical development, production capacity, need for water exchange, location requirements, financial status and other matters. To the best of our knowledge, none are producing significant quantities of shrimp relative to their local markets, and such fresh shrimp sales are likely confined to an area near the production facility.
  
 Additionally, any new competitor would face significant barriers for entry into the market and would likely need years of research and development to develop the proprietary technology necessary to produce similar shrimp at a commercially viable level. We believe our technology and business model sets us apart from any current competition. It is possible that additional competitors will arise in the future, but with the size and growth of the worldwide shrimp market, many competitors could co-exist and thrive in the fresh shrimp industry.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
 We intend to take appropriate steps to protect our intellectual property. We have registered the trademark “NATURALSHRIMP” which has been approved and was published in the Official Gazette on June 5, 2012. On December 25, 2018, we were awarded U.S. Patent “Recirculating Aquaculture System and Treatment Method for Aquatic Species” covering all indoor aquatic species that utilizes proprietary art. There are potential technical processes for which the Company may be able to file a patent. However, there are no assurances that such applications, if filed, would be issued and no right of enforcement is granted to a patent application. Therefore, the Company has filed a provisional patent with the U.S. Patent Office and plans to use a variety of other methods, including copyright registrations as appropriate, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and non-compete agreements to protect its intellectual property portfolio.
 Source and Availability of Raw Materials
  
 Raw materials are received in a timely manner from established suppliers. Currently, we buy our feed from Zeigler, a leading producer of aquatic feed. Post larvae (“PL”) shrimp are purchased from American Penaeid, Inc. (API) in Florida and Global Blue Technologies in Texas.
  
 There have not been any issues regarding the availability of our raw materials. We have favorable contacts and past business dealings with other major shrimp feed producers if current suppliers are not available.

 HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) - Not needed unless we process shrimp on site. Training and preparation of HACCP plans remain to be completed. There are multiple HACCP plans listed at http://seafood.ucdavis.edu/haccp/Plans.htm and other web sites that can be used as examples.

   ●
 Texas Department of State Health Services - Food manufacturer license # 1011080.

   ●
 Aquaculture Certification Council (ACC) and Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) - Provide shrimp production certification for shrimp marketing purposes to mainly well-established vendors. ACC and BAP certifications require extensive record keeping. No license is required at this time.

  
 We are subject to certain regulations regarding the need for field employees to be certified. We strictly adhere to these regulations. The cost of certification is an accepted part of expenses. Regulations may change and become a cost burden, but compliance and safety are our main concern.
  
  Market Advantages and Corporate Drivers
  
 The following are what we consider to be our advantages in the marketplace:
  
   ●
 Early-mover Advantage: Commercialized technology in a large growing market with no significant competition yet identified. Most are early stage start-ups or early stage companies with limited production and distribution.

   ●
 Farm-to-Market: This has significant advantages including reduced transportation costs and a product that is more attractive to local consumers.

   ●
 Bio-secured Building: Our process is a re-circulating, highly-filtered water technology in an indoor-regulated environment. External pathogens are excluded.

   ●
 Eco-friendly “Green” Technology: Our closed-loop, re-circulating system has no ocean water exchange requirements, does not use chemical or antibiotics and therefore is sustainable, eco-friendly, environmentally sound and produces a superior quality shrimp that is totally natural.

   ●
 Availability of Weekly Fresh Shrimp: Assures consumers of optimal freshness, taste, and texture of product which will command premium prices.

   ●
 Sustainability: Our naturally grown product does not deplete wild supplies, has no by-catch kill of marine life, does not damage sensitive ecological environments and avoids potential risks of imported seafood.

 
  Subsidiaries
  
 The Company has three wholly-owned subsidiaries including NaturalShrimp Corporation, NaturalShrimp Global, Inc. and Natural Aquatic Systems, Inc.

 Employees
  
 As of March 31, 2019, we had 5 full-time employees. We intend to hire additional staff and to engage consultants in general administration on an as-needed basis. We also may engage experts in general business to advise us in various capacities. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
