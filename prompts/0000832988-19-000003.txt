ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
Signet Jewelers Limited (“Signet” or the “Company”) is the world’s largest retailer of diamond jewelry. Signet is incorporated in Bermuda and its address and telephone number are shown on the cover of this document. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company realigned its organizational structure. The new structure is designed to facilitate further integration of operational and product development processes and to support growth strategies. In accordance with this organizational change, the Company, with 3,334 stores and kiosks as of February 2, 2019, now manages its business by geography, a description of which follows:

• | The North America segment operated 2,729 locations in the US and 128 locations in Canada as of February 2, 2019.


◦ | In the US, the segment primarily operates in malls and off-mall locations under the following banners: Kay (Kay Jewelers and Kay Outlet); Zales (Zales Jewelers and Zales Outlet); Jared (Jared The Galleria Of Jewelry and Jared Vault); a variety of mall-based regional banners; and James Allen, which was acquired in the R2Net acquisition in Fiscal 2018. Additionally, in the US, the segment operates mall-based kiosks under the Piercing Pagoda banner.


◦ | In Canada, the segment primarily operates under the Peoples banner (Peoples Jewellers), as well as the Mappins Jewellers regional banner.


◦ | The North America segment is entirely comprised of the Sterling Jewelers and Zale divisions reported under the Company’s previous reportable segment structure.


• | The International segment operated 477 stores in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and Channel Islands as of February 2, 2019. The segment primarily operates in shopping malls and off-mall locations under the H.Samuel and Ernest Jones banners. The International segment is entirely comprised of the UK Jewelry division reported under the Company’s previous reportable segment structure.

Certain company activities (e.g. diamond sourcing) are managed as a separate operating segment and are aggregated with unallocated corporate administrative functions in the segment “Other” for financial reporting purposes. Signet’s diamond sourcing function includes our diamond polishing factory in Botswana. See Note 6 of Item 8 for additional information regarding the Company’s reportable segments. 
MISSION & STRATEGY
Signet’s mission is to help customers “Celebrate Life and Express Love.” Our vision is take the lead and be the world’s premier jeweler by relentlessly connecting with customers, earning their trust with every interaction everywhere. 
Signet continues to be the market share leader in North America in a large, growing and fragmented category, with the opportunity for additional growth as we leverage our strengths and competitive advantages. However, Signet believes that to realize this opportunity, it must transform its business from that of a legacy mall retailer to a modern OmniChannel category leader.
As a result, in Fiscal 2019, Signet launched a three-year comprehensive transformation plan, “Signet’s Path to Brilliance,” to reposition the company to be the OmniChannel jewelry category leader. The goal of our transformation plan is to drive sustained growth by delivering inspiring products and ideal online and in-store shopping experiences to our customers. Funding for the improvements we need in systems, capabilities, product and stores is expected to come from cost savings - driving out costs customers don’t see and care about, to invest in what they do. We believe this plan will enable the Company to deliver long-term sustainable, profitable sales growth and create value for shareholders.
To achieve our Path to Brilliance goals, we believe we must relentlessly focus on the following three strategic pillars which define our key priorities and investment focus areas:

• | Customer First: A resolute focus on our customer in all aspects of the business, including product assortment, targeted and personalized marketing, promotions and communications, through consumer‐inspired innovation and advanced data analytics.


• | OmniChannel: Become a leading OmniChannel retailer creating a seamless shopping experience by enhancing our digital and in-store capabilities, towards the vision of a seamless experience across all points of customer engagement.


• | Culture of Efficiency & Agility: Unleash the capabilities of Signet’s diverse workplace to be agile, innovative, deliver operational excellence and efficiency with increased resource productivity.

5

Over the last few months we have performed a detailed review of our Fiscal 2019 performance and the foundational capabilities developed in Year 1 of Path to Brilliance. Additionally, we have restructured parts of the organization and made leadership changes aimed to position us for success. We believe that Path to Brilliance is the right strategy, and that we must move faster and more aggressively to achieve our goals. The learnings from this last year have been incorporated into our forward plans to improve both execution and financial performance. 
Our plan for Year 2 of Path to Brilliance is to build on the capabilities developed during Year 1, while accelerating growth initiatives to drive customer relevance, aggressively addressing our cost structure and bolstering our balance sheet. We have plans under each of our three strategic pillars to change the trajectory of our same store sales, stabilize and expand margins and improve our cash generation.
Key components of the transformation plan include:

• | Leading innovation and customer value. In early Fiscal 2019, Signet launched its innovation engine whose goal is to develop new solutions to customers’ jewelry needs to become an innovative disruptor in our category. In addition, we believe investments in data analytics and consumer insights including a system to track customer net promoter score, Signet’s “Voice of Customer” program, will allow us to better service our customers. The Company has begun reinvigorating its merchandise and value proposition focusing on 1) inspiring flagship brands, 2) right value and 3) on-trend product. Signet will continue to build on Fiscal 2019 key learnings and implement new programs designed to delight customers during their four key journeys (bridal, gifting, self-purchasing and repair). Combined with customer-inspired banner repositioning work, this is expected to allow the Company to make further progress in tailoring new product, marketing and promotional strategies unique to each store banner. In addition, investments will also focus on creating an in-store environment that resonates with today’s customer, better integrating technology to create a compelling, seamless OmniChannel experience.


• | Enhancing Signet's eCommerce and OmniChannel capabilities. Signet will continue to invest in platforms and becoming the leading jewelry retailer across channels. Building a best in class mobile experience and driving digital innovation is an important component of our Path to Brilliance. New initiatives aimed to drive increased digital traffic and improve conversion include a move to a more contemporary, dynamic platform for Jared and Kay that will be designed to enable better customer experience through faster speeds and high-quality imagery. In addition, we expect that investments in on-line jewelry customization tools, enhanced mobile experience, and continued greater personalization of content and product offering utilizing behavioral data management and machine learning will drive a better customer experience. This is also expected to enable and enhance digital marketing return on investments through greater visibility of customer's multi-touch journey. Signet aims to grow digital sales as a percentage of total revenues to 15% in Fiscal 2021, compared to 8% in Fiscal 2018.


• | Optimizing real estate footprint. Following an evaluation of its real estate footprint, utilization, and cost structure, Signet intends to optimize its portfolio to drive greater store productivity. We are working toward a portfolio of fewer, better stores, that provide a positive customer experience by delivering a fully connected OmniChannel journey. Our objective is to ensure our store base is located appropriately, providing sufficient returns to justify our investment and most importantly providing a delightful customer experience. Efforts include development and implementation of innovative store concepts to improve the in-store shopping experience, execution of opportunistic store relocations and store closures aimed at exiting under-performing stores, reducing the Company’s mall-based exposure and exiting regional brands. Store closing decisions are informed by strategic considerations and data analytics, including store performance, sales transference potential, mall grade and trend. In Fiscal 2019, Signet closed 262 stores, the majority of which were in malls where we operate another Signet banner store. Signet will continue to optimize its portfolio with more than 150 store closures expected in Fiscal 2020. At the end of the three-year transformation plan, Signet will have a leaner, more diversified footprint and more compelling and connected store experiences that we believe will be better aligned to our strategic banner positionings.


• | Reducing non-customer facing costs. In line with Signet’s goal of creating a Culture of Agility and Efficiency, the Company implemented initiatives across its operations, including strategic sourcing, distribution and warehousing, and corporate and support functions to drive cost savings and operational efficiencies. These include procurement savings with respect to merchandise and indirect spend, consolidating facilities and payroll savings as a result of implementing simplified organization structures with wider spans of control and fewer layers of management. The Company expects its transformation plan to deliver $200-$225 million net cost savings (excludes cost reductions associated with store closures) by the end of Fiscal 2021. In Fiscal 2019, Signet realized $85 million of net costs savings. The gross savings from these initiatives will be used to fund needed investments in technology, capabilities, and store experience.


• | Strengthening employee engagement and building capabilities. Our team and organization are key to accomplishing the company's transformation goals. Signet has hired and promoted several executives to fill key leadership roles, is investing in building e-commerce, analytics and innovation capabilities, and is focusing on reigniting employee engagement in our store operations and throughout the entire organization through cultural initiatives, leadership and skills training, and enhanced career development opportunities.

Competition and Signet Competitive Strengths
Jewelry retailing is highly fragmented and competitive. We compete against other specialty jewelers, as well as other retailers that sell jewelry, including department stores, mass merchandisers, discount stores, apparel and accessory fashion stores, brand retailers, online retail and auction sites, shopping clubs, home shopping television channels and direct home sellers. The jewelry category competes for customers’ share-of-wallet with other consumer sectors such as electronics, clothing and furniture, as well as travel and restaurants. This competition for consumers’ discretionary spending is particularly relevant to gift giving.
We believe that Signet’s competitive strengths include: strong store banner recognition, outstanding customer experience, branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise, sector-leading marketing and advertising, diversified real estate portfolio, supply chain leadership, and a full spectrum of services including financing and lease purchase options, extended service plans, repair and customer design, and piercing.
Capital Strategy
The tenets of Signet’s capital strategy allocation priorities continue to be as follows: 1) invest in its business to drive growth; 2) protect business from economic downturns by ensuring adequate liquidity; and 3) return excess cash to shareholders. Over time, Signet is committed to achieving an investment grade profile. Part of Signet’s capital strategy is to maintain the Company’s expected long-term adjusted debt(1)/ adjusted EBITDAR(1) (“adjusted leverage ratio”) of 3.0x to 3.5x. As previously announced, the Company exceeded the high end of its target leverage range in Fiscal 2019. The Company expects to exceed the high end of the target range in Fiscal 2020 but believes it will reach approximately 3.5x by the end of the three-year transformation plan.
Based on projected investments and liquidity needs, the Company expects to maintain its quarterly dividend rate of $0.37 per share but does not anticipate share buybacks for Fiscal 2020. The Company has a remaining share repurchase authorization as of the end of Fiscal 2019 of $165.6 million.

(1) | Adjusted debt, Adjusted EBITDAR, and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. Signet believes they are useful measures to provide insight into how the Company intends to use capital. See Item 6 for reconciliation.

BACKGROUND
Operating segments
The business is currently managed as three reportable segments: the North America segment (90.3% of sales and 81.2% of operating loss), the International segment (9.2% of sales and (1.7)% of operating loss) and the Other segment. The Other reportable segment consists of all non-reportable segments, including subsidiaries involved in the purchasing and conversion of rough diamonds to polished stones and unallocated corporate administrative functions. All segments are managed by an executive committee, which is chaired by Signet’s Chief Executive Officer, who reports to the Board of Directors of Signet (the “Board”). The executive committee is responsible for operating decisions within parameters established by the Board. See Note 6 of Item 8 for additional information regarding the Company’s segments as well as disclosure detailing and reconciling the components of operating income.
Trademarks and trade names 
Signet is not dependent on any material patents or licenses in any of its segments. Signet has several well-established trademarks and trade names which are significant in maintaining its reputation and competitive position in the jewelry retailing industry. Some of these registered trademarks and trade names include the following:

• | Kay Jewelers®; Kay Jewelers Outlet®; Jared The Galleria Of Jewelry®; Jared Vault®; Jared Jewelry Boutique®; JB Robinson® Jewelers; Marks & Morgan Jewelers®; Every kiss begins with Kay®; Jared EternityTM; Celebrate Life.

Store locations
Signet operates retail jewelry stores in a variety of real estate formats including mall-based, free-standing, strip center and outlet store locations. As of February 2, 2019, Signet operated 2,760 stores and 574 kiosks across 4.7 million square feet of retail space in the US, UK and Canada. This represented a decrease of 6.2% and a decrease of 5.7% in locations and retail space, respectively, from Fiscal 2018. Store locations by country and territory as of February 2, 2019 are disclosed in Item 2.

Customer experience
We will strive at Signet to continue to be focused on driving an inspiring, full service, seamlessly connected customer experience, which is an essential element in the success of our business. Therefore, the ability to recruit, develop and retain qualified jewelry consultants is an important element in enhancing customer satisfaction. We have comprehensive recruitment, training and incentive programs in place, including an annual flagship training conference in advance of the holiday season. 
Signet continues to invest in technology to enhance the customer shopping experience to make it more personalized and journey specific. In Fiscal 2019, Signet implemented a multi-phase Voice of Customer program as a component of our Path to Brilliance and customer first strategies. The first phase focused on setting up the technology, establishing stable measurements for key customer journeys (net promoter score) and discovering how to effectively operationalize customer feedback.
OmniChannel 
As a specialty jeweler, Signet’s business differs from many other retailers such that a purchase of merchandise from any of Signet’s stores is personal, intimate and typically viewed as an important experience. Due to this dynamic, customers often invest time on Signet websites and social media to experience the merchandise assortments prior to visiting brick-and-mortar stores to execute a purchase transaction. Particularly related to high value transactions, customers will supplement their online experience with an in-store visit prior to finalizing a purchase. 
Through Signet’s websites, we educate customers and provide them with a source of information on products and brands, available merchandise, as well as the ability to buy online. Our websites are integrated with each segment’s stores, so that merchandise ordered online may be picked up at a store or delivered to the customer. Banner websites continue to make an important and growing contribution to the customer experience, as well as to each segment’s marketing programs. As in Fiscal 2019, the Company will continue to focus on:

• | Investments in technology, including eCommerce platforms, focused on improving the online journey. Customer journey enhancements include user generated content, enhanced personalization / behavioral targeting, creative execution and brand differentiation. In addition, we are focused on OmniChannel wishlist, online merchandising, in-store appointment booking, bridal configuration and much more.


• | Optimization of marketing through prioritizing dollars to digital spend and targeted marketing through traditional media.


• | Increased use of data analytics, clienteling and other key touch points to achieve a more comprehensive view of the customer and allow us to anticipate their needs.

Signet’s supplier relationships allow it to display suppliers’ inventories on the banner websites for sale to customers without holding the items in its inventory until the products are ordered by customers, which are referred to as “virtual inventory.” Virtual inventory expands the choice of merchandise available to customers both online and in-store.
Raw materials 
The jewelry industry generally is affected by fluctuations in the price and supply of diamonds, gold and, to a much lesser extent, other precious and semi-precious metals and stones. Diamonds account for about 52%, and gold about 14%, of Signet’s cost of merchandise sold, respectively.
Signet undertakes hedging for a portion of its requirement for gold through the use of net zero premium cost collar arrangements, forward contracts and participating forwards or swaps. It is not possible to hedge against fluctuations in the cost of diamonds. The cost of raw materials is only part of the costs involved in determining the retail selling price of jewelry, with labor costs also being a significant factor. 
Diamond sourcing
Signet procures its diamonds mostly as finished jewelry and, to a smaller extent, as loose polished diamonds and rough diamonds which are in turn polished in Signet’s Botswana factory.
Finished jewelry
Signet purchases finished product where management has identified compelling value based on product design, cost and availability, among other factors. Under certain types of arrangements, this method of purchasing also provides the Company with the opportunity to reserve inventory held by vendors and to make returns or exchanges with suppliers, which reduces the risk of over- or under-purchasing. Signet’s scale, balance sheet and robust procurement systems enable it to purchase merchandise at advantageous prices and on favorable terms.

Loose diamonds
Signet purchases loose polished diamonds in global markets (e.g. India, Israel) from a variety of sources (e.g. polishers, traders). Signet mounts stones in settings purchased from manufacturers using third parties and in-house resources. By using these approaches, the cost of merchandise is reduced and the consistency of quality is maintained enabling Signet to provide better value to customers. Buying loose diamonds helps allow Signet’s buyers to gain a detailed understanding of the manufacturing cost structures and, in turn, leverage that knowledge with regard to negotiating better prices for the supply of finished products. 
Rough diamonds
Signet continues to take steps to advance its vertical integration, which includes rough diamond sourcing and processing. Signet’s objective with this initiative is to secure additional, reliable and consistent supplies of diamonds for customers worldwide while achieving further efficiencies in the supply chain. Signet owns a diamond polishing factory in Gaborone, Botswana. The Company is a DeBeers sightholder, and receives contracted allocations of rough diamonds from Rio Tinto, DeBeers and Alrosa. Signet has also established a diamond liaison office in India and a diamond trading office in New York to further support its sourcing initiative. 
Rough diamonds are purchased directly from the miners and then have the stones marked, cut and polished in Signet’s own polishing facility. Any stones deemed unsuitable for Signet’s needs are sold to third parties with the objective of recovering the original cost of the stones.
Merchandising
Management believes that a competitive strength is our industry-leading merchandising. Merchandise selection, innovation, availability and value are all critical success factors. The range of merchandise offered and the high level of inventory availability are supported centrally by extensive and continuous research and testing. Signet’s jewelry design center in New York evaluates global design trends, innovates, and helps our merchant teams develop new jewelry collections that resonate with customers.
Merchandise mix
Details of merchandise mix (excluding repairs, warranty and other miscellaneous sales) are shown below:

 | North America | | International | | Consolidated
Fiscal 2019 | | | | | 
Bridal | 49 | % | | 42 | % | 48 | %
Fashion | 44 | % | | 21 | % | 42 | %
Watches | 5 | % | | 35 | % | 8 | %
Other | 2 | % | | 2 | % | 2 | %
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %
Fiscal 2018 | | | | | 
Bridal | 48 | % | | 36 | % | 46 | %
Fashion | 44 | % | | 28 | % | 43 | %
Watches | 5 | % | | 34 | % | 8 | %
Other | 3 | % | | 2 | % | 3 | %
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

The bridal category, which includes engagement, wedding and anniversary purchases, is predominantly diamond jewelry. Like fashion jewelry and watches, bridal is to an extent dependent on the economic environment as customers can trade up or down price points depending on their available budget. Bridal represented approximately 50% of Signet’s total merchandise sales. In Fiscal 2019 the Enchanted Disney Fine Jewelry® collection, Vera Wang Love® collection, Neil Lane® collection, and solitaires performed well while the Ever Us® collection declined.
The fashion category is significantly impacted by gift giving in the Holiday Season, Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day time periods and represented 42% of Signet’s total merchandise sales.
The Other category primarily includes beads and represented 2% of Signet’s total merchandise versus 3% in the prior year primarily due to a strategic reduction of owned brand bead collections as well as declines in branded bead collections. 
9

Merchandise is categorized as non-branded, third party branded, and branded differentiated and exclusive. Non-branded merchandise includes items and styles such as bracelets, gold necklaces, solitaire diamond rings, and diamond stud earrings. Third party branded merchandise includes mostly watches, but also includes ranges of charm bracelets. Branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise are items that are branded and exclusive to Signet within its marketplaces, or that are not widely available in other jewelry retailers (e.g Vera Wang Love, Neil Lane, Disney Enchanted).
Branded differentiated and exclusive ranges 
Management believes that the development of branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise raises the profile of Signet’s banners, helps to drive sales and provides its well-trained sales associates with a powerful selling proposition. Digital marketing and national television advertisements include elements that drive brand awareness and purchase intent of these ranges. Signet’s scale and proven record of success in developing branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise attracts offers of such programs from jewelry manufacturers, designers and others ahead of competing retailers, and enables it to leverage its supply chain strengths. 
Merchandise held on consignment
Merchandise held on consignment is used to enhance product selection and test new designs. This minimizes exposure to changes in fashion trends and obsolescence, and provides the flexibility to return non-performing merchandise. Virtually all of Signet’s consignment inventory is held in the US. 
Suppliers
In Fiscal 2019, the five largest suppliers collectively accounted for 19.7% of total purchases, with the largest supplier comprising 6.4%. Signet transacts business with suppliers on a worldwide basis at various stages of the supply chain with third party diamond cutting and jewelry manufacturing being predominantly carried out in Asia.
Marketing and advertising
Customers’ confidence in our retail brands, store banner name recognition and advertising of branded differentiated and exclusive ranges are important factors in determining buying decisions in the jewelry industry where the majority of merchandise is unbranded. Therefore, Signet continues to strengthen and promote its store banners and merchandise brands by focusing on delivering superior customer service and building brand name recognition. The Company’s OmniChannel approach leverages marketing investments in television, digital media (desktop, mobile and social), radio, print, catalog, direct mail, point of sale signage and in-store displays.
Marketing activities are undertaken throughout the year, digital capabilities provide insight into customer journeys enabling personalized journey-based communications at the most appropriate moment through social media and digital marketing. We plan to transform and modernize our marketing model in Fiscal 2020 by re-balancing the timing and mix of our media investments, leveraging a more personalized journey-based approach, and modernizing our content and messaging. In fact, Fiscal 2020 will be the first year that Signet spends more on digital and social marketing than on television advertising. Building on successful “Always On” bridal tests at Kay, we plan to grow our share of gifting occasions with a targeted focus on special occasion milestones like birthdays and anniversaries. 
We will also aim to significantly improve the effectiveness of our creative campaigns, building on the banner differentiation work launched in Fiscal 2019. Within the past year, we’ve brought on new creative agencies for every North America banner as well as a new data savvy media agency. Together, we are evolving our campaigns with more sophisticated, journey specific content and using data science to more efficiently target our spend.
Details of gross advertising, advertising before vendor contributions, by segment is shown below:

 | Fiscal 2019 | | Fiscal 2018 | | Fiscal 2017 
(in millions) | Gross advertising spending | as a % of segment sales | | Gross advertising spending | as a % of segment sales | | Gross advertising spending | as a % of segment sales
North America | $ | 368.5 | | 6.5 | % | | $ | 340.4 | | 6.1 | % | $ | 358.8 | 6.2 | %
International | 19.3 | | 3.3 | % | | 20.1 | | 3.3 | % | | 21.8 | 3.4 | % 
Signet | $ | 387.8 | | 6.2 | % | | $ | 360.5 | | 5.8 | % | $ | 380.6 | 5.9 | %

Customer finance
In our North American markets, Signet sells products for cash and for payment through major credit cards, online payment systems and lease purchase options. In addition, the Company has partnerships with third-party providers who directly extend credit to its customers, and who also manage and service the customers’ accounts.
Comenity Bank provides credit and services to the Zales and Piercing Pagoda banners and to prime-only credit quality customers for Kay and Jared banners. Genesis Financial Solutions (“Genesis”) provides a second look program for applicants declined by Comenity Bank.
10

For Kay and Jared banners, Signet originates non-prime receivables and sells them subject to a contractually agreed upon discount rate to funds managed by CarVal Investors (“CarVal”), the majority investor and Castlelake, L.P. (“Castlelake”), the minority investor. Servicing of the non-prime receivables prior to sale to the investors, including operational interfaces and customer servicing, is provided by Genesis.
Real estate 
Management has specific operating and financial criteria that must be satisfied before investing in new stores or renewing leases on existing stores. Substantially all the stores operated by Signet are leased. Signet continues to, over time, reposition its portfolio in a manner that it believes will drive greater store productivity. These efforts include development and implementation of innovative store concepts to improve the in-store shopping experience, execution of opportunistic store relocations and store closures aimed at exiting under-performing stores, reducing the Company’s mall-based exposure and exiting regional brands. 
Recent investment in the store portfolio is set out below:

Seasonality
Signet’s sales are seasonal, with the fourth quarter accounting for approximately 35-40% of annual sales, with December being by far the highest volume month of the year. The “Holiday Season” consists of results for the months of November and December. As a result of our transformation initiatives, we anticipate our operating profit will be almost entirely generated in the fourth quarter.
Employees 
In Fiscal 2019, the average number of full-time equivalent persons employed was 22,989. In addition, Signet usually employs a limited number of temporary employees during its fourth quarter. None of Signet’s employees in the UK and less than 1% of Signet’s employees in the US and Canada are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Regulation
Signet is required to comply with numerous laws and regulations covering areas such as consumer protection, consumer privacy, data protection, consumer credit, consumer credit insurance, health and safety, waste disposal, supply chain integrity, truth in advertising and employment. Management monitors changes in these laws to endeavor to comply with applicable requirements.

Around 83% of the market is represented by jewelry, with the balance being attributable to watches. According to the latest data from the US Labor Department, there were close to 20,400 jewelry stores in the country, down 0.9% from the prior year.

UK
In the UK, the jewelry and watch market was estimated at about £5.7 billion in 2018, up 2.9% from the prior year, according to Mintel. Growth was driven by continued demand for luxury and high-ticket items. Self-purchasing among young women and gifting among men represent the largest parts of the precious jewelry market.

Zales Jewelers (“Zales”)
Zales Jewelers operates primarily in shopping malls and offers a broad range of bridal, diamond solitaire and fashion jewelry. Zales Outlet operates in outlet malls and neighborhood power centers and capitalizes on Zales Jewelers’ national marketing and brand recognition.

Every Jared store has an on-site design and service center where most repairs are completed within the same day. 
The typical Jared store has about 4,800 square feet of selling space and approximately 6,000 square feet of total space. Jared locations are normally free-standing sites with high visibility and traffic flow, positioned close to major roads within shopping developments. Jared stores usually operate in retail centers that contain strong retail co-tenants, including big box, destination stores and some smaller specialty units.
Jared also operates a smaller off-mall concept known as Jared 4.0, which utilizes approximately 3,600 square feet of selling space, allows for store openings in smaller markets, expands the Jared brand and increases the return on Jared advertising investment. Finally, Jared operates an outlet-mall concept known as Jared Vault which utilizes approximately 1,600 square feet of selling space. These stores are smaller than off-mall Jareds and offer a mix of identical products as Jared, as well as different, outlet-specific products at lower prices.

This store is an opportunity to test new concepts and incorporate innovation in new store design plans for all of our banners.

North America operating review
Other sales
Custom design services represent less than 5% of sales but provide higher than average profitability. Our custom jewelry initiative has a proprietary computer selling system and in-store design capabilities. Design & Service Centers, located in Jared stores, are staffed with skilled artisans who support the custom business generated by other North America segment stores, as well as the Jared stores in which they are located. The custom design and repair function has its own field management and training structure.
Repair services represent less than 5% of sales, approximately 20% of transactions and are an important opportunity to build customer loyalty. The Jared Design & Service Centers, open the same hours as the store, also support other North America segment stores’ repair business.
The North America segment sells extended service plans covering lifetime repair service for jewelry and jewelry replacement plans. The lifetime repair service plans cover services such as ring sizing, refinishing and polishing, rhodium plating of white gold, earring repair, chain soldering and the resetting of diamonds and gemstones that arise due to the normal usage of the merchandise or a replacement option if the merchandise cannot be repaired. The extended service plans have a higher rate of profitability than merchandise sales and are a significant component of Signet’s operating income. Jewelry replacement plans require the issuance of new replacement merchandise if the original merchandise is determined to be defective or damaged within a defined period in accordance with the plan agreement. Any repair work is performed in-house. The North America segment also offers customers a two-year fine watch warranty. Additionally, Zale and Piercing Pagoda offer a one-year jewelry replacement program, which requires the issuance of new replacement merchandise if the original merchandise is determined to be defective or damaged in accordance with the plan agreement. 
Customer finance 
Several factors inherent in the US jewelry business support the circumstances through which we believe Signet is uniquely positioned to generate profitable incremental business through its partner supported consumer payment programs. These factors include a high average transaction value and a significant population of customers seeking to finance merchandise, primarily in the bridal category. Our consumer credit and lease programs are an integral part of our business and a major driver of customer loyalty. Customers are offered revolving and promotional credit plans under our private label credit card programs and a lease purchase option provided by Progressive Lease allowing Signet to offer payment options that meet each customer’s individual needs.
Below is a summary of the payment participation rate in North America which reflects activity for in-house and outsourced credit program customers in North America, including legacy Sterling Jewelers, Zale Jewelry and Piercing Pagoda customers, as well as lease purchase customers:

 | Fiscal 2019 | | Fiscal 2018
Total North America sales (excluding James Allen)(1) (millions) | $ | 5,418.0 | | | $ | 5,527.0
Credit and lease purchase sales (millions) | $ | 2,799.5 | | | $ | 2,889.0
Credit and lease purchase sales as % of total North America sales(1) | 51.7 | % | | 52.3 | %

INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT
The International segment transacts mainly in British pounds, as sales and the majority of operating expenses are incurred in that currency and its results are then translated into US dollars for external reporting purposes. In Fiscal 2019, approximately 31% of goods purchased were made in US dollars (Fiscal 2018: 27%). The following information for the International segment is given in British pounds as management believes that this presentation assists in understanding the performance of the International segment. Movements in the US dollar to British pound exchange rate therefore may have an impact on the results of Signet, particularly in periods of exchange rate volatility.
International market
Ernest Jones and H.Samuel compete with a large number of independent jewelry retailers, as well as discount jewelry retailers, online retail and auction sites, apparel and accessory fashion stores, catalog showroom operators and supermarkets.
