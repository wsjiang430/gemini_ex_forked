Customers
Our products are sold worldwide to approximately 370 OEMs and integrators and directly to more than 1,500 end users. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 62.5% of our sales in 2018, 70.4% of our sales in 2017, and 67.7% of our sales in 2016. We expect that the sale of products to our largest customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our sales for the foreseeable future.
Applied Materials Inc., our largest customer, accounted for 35.9% of our sales in 2018, 33.5% of our sales in 2017, and 35.2% of our sales in 2016. Lam Research accounted for 15.2% of our sales in 2018, 23.1% of our sales in 2017, and 20.7% of our sales in 2016. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of our sales in 2018, 2017, or 2016. The loss of Applied Materials, Inc. or Lam Research as a customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Backlog
Our backlog was approximately $74.7 million at December 31, 2018, a 43.1% decrease from $131.3 million at December 31, 2017. This decrease primarily resulted from slowing demand in the semiconductor market. For more information related to our expectations for the markets we serve, see Business Environment and Trends in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Backlog orders are firm orders scheduled to be filled and shipped in the next 12 months.
Backlog orders are not necessarily an indicator of future sales levels because of variations in lead times and customer production demand pull systems, which are not reflected in orders or backlog. Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment, subject to possible cancellation penalties. Delays in delivery schedules and/or customer changes to backlog orders during any particular period could cause a decrease in sales and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
We sell our products through direct and indirect sales channels in North America, Europe and Asia. Our sales operations are primarily located in the United States, the PRC, the United Kingdom, Germany, Israel, Japan, South Korea, India, Singapore and Taiwan. In addition to a direct sales force, we have independent sales representatives and distributors that support our selling efforts. We maintain customer service offices at many of the locations listed above, as well as other sites near our customers' locations. We believe that customer service and technical support are important competitive factors and are essential to building and maintaining close, long-term relationships with our customers.

See Item 1A "Risk Factors" for a discussion of certain risks related to our foreign operations.
Manufacturing
The manufacturing of our products is performed in Shenzhen, PRC; Ronkonkoma and Lockport, New York; Santa Clara, California; Littlehampton, United Kingdom; Frankfurt, Germany; Ballerup, Denmark; and Vancouver, Washington. Manufacturing in these locations, primarily the PRC, exposes us to risks, such as exchange controls and currency restrictions, changes in local economic conditions, changes in laws and regulations, government actions, political conditions, and an inability to meet customer demands if one of our facilities becomes impaired.
Manufacturing requires raw materials, including a wide variety of mechanical and electrical components, to be manufactured to our specifications. We use numerous companies, including contract manufacturers, to supply parts for the manufacture and support of our products. Although we make reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers, some key parts may be obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We seek to reduce costs and to lower the risks of production and service interruptions, as well as shortages of key parts by:

• | selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for key parts using rigorous technical and commercial evaluation of suppliers' products and business processes including testing their components' performance, quality, and reliability on our power conversion product at our customers' and their customer's processes. The qualification process for our process power products, particularly as it pertains to semiconductor customers, follows semiconductor industry standard practices, such as “copy exact”;


• | monitoring the financial condition and overall performance of key suppliers;


• | maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts, including making last time purchases of key parts when notified by suppliers that they are ending the supply of those parts;


• | qualifying new parts on a timely basis and in geographies that reduce costs without degradation in quality;


• | locating certain manufacturing operations in areas that are closer to suppliers and customers; and


• | competitively sourcing parts through electronic bidding tools to ensure the lowest total cost is achieved for the parts needed in our products.

Intellectual Property
We seek patent protection for inventions governing new products or technologies as part of our ongoing research and development. We currently hold 140 United States patents and 137 foreign-issued patents, and have 30 patent applications pending in the United States, Europe and Asia. A substantial majority of our patents are related to our process power products and solutions business. Generally, our efforts to obtain international patents have been concentrated in the industrialized countries within Europe and Asia because there are other manufacturers and developers of power conversion and control systems in those countries, as well as customers for those systems for which our intellectual property applies.
Litigation may, from time to time, be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how owned by us, to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others, or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. See "We are highly dependent on our intellectual property" in Item 1A "Risk Factors."
Competition
The markets we serve are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological development and changing customer requirements. No single company dominates any of our markets. Significant competitive factors in our markets include product performance, compatibility with adjacent products, price, quality, reliability, and level of customer service and support.
We have seen an increase in global competition in the markets in which we compete, especially from Asian and European-based component suppliers. We encounter substantial competition from foreign and domestic companies for each of our product lines. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. In some cases, competitors are smaller than we are, but are well established in specific product niches. Adtec Plasma Tech. Co., Ltd., COMET Holding AG., Daihen Corp., Kyosan Electric Mfg. Co., Ltd., MKS Instruments, Inc., New Power Plasma Co., Ltd., and TRUMPF Hüttinger GmbH + Co. KG., compete with our power conversion products for semiconductor and thin 
 7

film processing. Crane Co., Matsusada Precision, Inc., and Spellman High Voltage Electronics Corp. offer products that compete with our high voltage products. CD Automation, Eurotherm, Control Concepts Inc., and Spang Power Electronics offer products that compete with our power control modules. Artesyn Embedded Technologies, Cosel Co., Ltd., Mean Well, TKD-Lambda Americas Inc., Vox Power and XP Power Ltd. compete with our low voltage products. BASF SE., Fluke Corp., LayTec AG., and Photon Control Inc., offer products that compete with our thermal measurement and instrumentation products. Honeywell International, Inc., Morgan Schaffer Ltd., Qualitrol Corp., and Williamson Corp. offer products that compete with our gas detection and monitoring products.
Additionally, a focus on local content is causing new competitors to emerge around the world, with strong support from local governments, industry leaders, and investors.
Our ability to continue to compete successfully in these markets depends on our ability to make timely introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, to localize these development and production activities in key world regions, and to produce high quality products. We expect our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their products and introduce new products with competitive performance characteristics. We believe that we compete effectively with respect to these factors, although we cannot assure that we will be able to compete effectively in the future.
Research and Development
The market for our precision power conversion, thermal, and high voltage products is characterized by ongoing technological changes. We believe that continued and timely development of new highly-differentiated products and enhancements to existing products to support end user and OEM requirements is necessary for us to maintain a competitive position in the markets we serve. Accordingly, we continue to devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development projects and seek to maintain close relationships with our key customers and other industry leaders in order to remain responsive to their product requirements now and in the future.
Research and development expenses were $76.0 million in 2018, $58.0 million in 2017, and $44.4 million in 2016, representing 10.6% of our sales in 2018, 8.6% of our sales in 2017, and 9.2% of our sales in 2016.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 2,259 employees. Our employees are not represented by unions, except for statutory organization rights applicable to our employees in the PRC and Germany. We believe that our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Effect of Environmental Laws
We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as the environmental laws and regulations of the foreign federal and local jurisdictions in which we have manufacturing and service facilities. We believe we are in material compliance with all such laws and regulations.
Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, an adverse effect on our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition, or results of operations.
