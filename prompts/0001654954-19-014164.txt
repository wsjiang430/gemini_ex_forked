ITEM 1.
BUSINESS

 
 CEL-SCI Corporation (CEL-SCI) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on finding the best way to activate the immune system to fight cancer and infectious diseases. Its lead investigational therapy Multikine® (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection) is currently in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for patients who are newly diagnosed with advanced primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, for which CEL-SCI has received Orphan Drug Status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. The study was fully enrolled with 928 patients in September 2016. The study’s primary end-point is a 10% increase in overall survival of patients between the two main comparator groups in favor of the group receiving the Multikine treatment regimen. The determination if the study’s primary end-point is met will occur when there are a total of 298 deaths in those two groups. If the primary end-point of this global study is achieved, CEL-SCI expects to use the results to support a Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the FDA for Multikine for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or SCCHN (hereafter also referred to as advanced primary head and neck cancer).
  
 CEL-SCI’s investigational immunotherapy, Multikine, is being used in a different way than cancer immunotherapy is usually used. It is given before any other therapy has been administered because that is when the immune system is thought to be strongest (i.e., as a neoadjuvant). It is also administered locally around the tumors and near the draining lymph node. For example, in the Phase 3 clinical trial, Multikine was given locally for three weeks, five days per week as a first line treatment before surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. The goal is to help the intact immune system kill the micro metastases that usually cause recurrence of the cancer. In short, CEL-SCI believes that local administration of this neoadjuvant therapy and administration before weakening of the immune system by surgery, chemotherapy and radiation will result in improved outcomes and better overall survival rates for patients suffering from head and neck cancer.
  
 CEL-SCI is also investigating a peptide-based immunotherapy as a vaccine for rheumatoid arthritis using its LEAPS technology platform. CEL-SCI was awarded a Phase 2 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant in the amount of $1.5 million from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in September 2017. This grant will provide funding to allow CEL-SCI to advance its first LEAPS product candidate, CEL-4000, towards an Investigational New Drug (IND) application.
  
 CEL-SCI was formed as a Colorado corporation in 1983. CEL-SCI’s principal office is located at 8229 Boone Boulevard, Suite 802, Vienna, VA 22182.

  CEL-SCI’S PRODUCTS
  
 CEL-SCI is a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to research and development directed at improving the treatment of cancer and other diseases by using the immune system, the body’s natural defense system. CEL-SCI is currently focused on the development of the following product candidates and technologies:
  
  1) 
 Multikine, an investigational immunotherapy under development for the potential treatment of certain head and neck cancers;


  2) 
 L.E.A.P.S. (Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System) technology, or LEAPS, with two investigational therapies, CEL-2000 and CEL-4000, vaccine product candidates under development for the potential treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and LEAPS-H1N1-DC, a product candidate under development for the potential treatment of pandemic influenza in hospitalized patients,


 
  MULTIKINE
  
 CEL-SCI’s lead investigational therapy, Multikine, is currently being developed as a potential therapeutic agent directed at using the immune system to produce an anti-tumor immune response. Data from Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials suggest that Multikine may help the immune system “see” the tumor and then attack it, enabling the body’s own anti-tumor immune response to fight the tumor. Multikine is the trademark that CEL-SCI has registered for this investigational therapy, and this proprietary name is subject to review by the FDA, in connection with CEL-SCI’s future anticipated regulatory submission for approval in the United States. Multikine has not been licensed or approved for sale, barter or exchange by the FDA or any other regulatory agency, such as the European Medicine Agency, or EMA, and neither its safety nor its efficacy been established.
  
 Multikine is an immunotherapy product candidate comprised of a patented defined mixture of 14 human natural cytokines. Upon commercial approval, CEL-SCI intends to manufacture it in a proprietary manner in CEL-SCI’s manufacturing facility. CEL-SCI spent over 10 years and more than $80 million developing and validating the manufacturing process for Multikine. The pro-inflammatory cytokine mixture includes interleukins, interferons, chemokines and colony-stimulating factors, which contain elements of the body’s natural mix of defenses against cancer.

 Multikine is designed to be used in a different way than cancer immunotherapy is generally being used. Generally, cancer immunotherapy is given to patients who have already failed other treatments such as surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy and most of the time it is administered systemically.  Multikine on the other hand is administered locally to treat tumors and their microenvironment before any other therapy has been administered because it is believed that this is the time when the immune system would be most amenable to activation against the tumor.  For example, during the dosing phase of the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial, Multikine was injected locally around the tumor and near the adjacent draining lymph nodes as a first line of treatment before surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. The goal is to help the intact immune system recognize and kill the tumor micro metastases that usually cause recurrence of the cancer. In short, CEL-SCI believes that the local administration and administration of Multikine and its administration before weakening of the immune system by surgery, chemotherapy and radiation will result in better anti-tumor response than if Multikine were administered as a second- or later-line therapy. In clinical studies of Multikine, administration of the investigational therapy to head and neck cancer patients has demonstrated the potential for lesser or no appreciable toxicity.

 The first indication CEL-SCI is pursuing for its investigational drug product candidate Multikine is an indication for the neoadjuvant therapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or SCCHN (hereafter also referred to as advanced primary head and neck cancer).
  
   
4


  
 
 SCCHN represents one type of head and neck cancer, and CEL-SCI believes that there is a large, unmet medical need among head and neck cancer patients as a whole. CEL-SCI believes the last FDA approval of a therapy indicated for the treatment of advanced primary head and neck cancer was over 50 years ago. In the aggregate, head and neck cancer represents about 6% of the world’s cancer cases, with approximately 650,000 patients diagnosed worldwide each year, of which approximately 60,000 patients diagnosed annually in the United States and approximately 105,000 patients diagnosed annually in Europe. Multikine investigational immunotherapy has been granted Orphan Drug designation for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with SCCHN by the FDA in the United States.
  
 The current Phase 3 study for Multikine was designed with the objective that, if the study endpoint, which is an improvement in overall survival of the subjects treated with the Multikine treatment regimen plus the current Standard of Care (SOC) as compared to subjects treated with the current SOC only, is satisfied, the study results are expected to be used to support applications that CEL-SCI plans to submit to regulatory agencies in order to seek commercial marketing approvals for Multikine in major markets around the world. The assessment of whether the primary study endpoint was met can only be made when a certain number of events (deaths) have occurred in these two main comparator groups of the study.
  
 The primary endpoint for the protocol for this Phase 3 head and neck cancer study required that a 10% increase in overall survival be obtained in the Multikine group which also is administered CIZ (CIZ = low dose (non-chemotherapeutic) of cyclophosphamide, indomethacin and Zinc-multivitamins) all of which are thought to enhance Multikine activity), plus SOC (Surgery + Radiotherapy or Chemoradiotherapy) arm of the study over the control comparator (SOC alone) arm. As the study was designed, the final determination of whether this endpoint had been successfully reached can only be determined when 298 events have occurred in the combined comparator arms of the study.
  
 Nine hundred twenty-eight (928) newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients have been enrolled in this Phase 3 cancer study across 24 countries and all the patients who have completed treatment continue to be followed for protocol-specific outcomes in accordance with the study protocol. The last patient was enrolled in the study in September 2016. Approximately 135 patients were enrolled in the study from 2011 to 2013, about 195 were enrolled in 2014, about 340 in 2015, and about 260 in 2016. The Phase 3 study protocol assumed an overall survival rate of about 55% at 3 years for the SOC treatment group alone. An analysis conducted using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results, or SEER U.S. government data base for the same study population as CEL-SCI enrolled in this Phase 3 study and covering the years 2011-2016 (when the patients were enrolled), shows that the standard of care for these patients has not resulted in an improvement in survival. In fact, the U.S. survival of the specific type of patients enrolled in the Phase 3 study during the study years was only about 47% at 3 years and about 37% at 5 years. At this point, all patients enrolled in the study are being followed-up as required by the study protocol.
 
 This trial is currently under the management of two clinical research organizations, or CROs: ICON Inc., or ICON, and Ergomed Clinical Research Limited, or Ergomed.
  
 Since CEL-SCI launched its Phase 3 clinical trial for Multikine, CEL-SCI has incurred expenses of approximately $55.8 million as of September 30, 2019 on direct costs for the Phase 3 clinical trial. CEL-SCI estimates it will incur additional expenses of approximately $4.5 million for the remainder of the Phase 3 clinical trial. It should be noted that this estimate is based only on the information currently available in CEL-SCI’s contracts with the CROs responsible for managing the Phase 3 clinical trial and does not include other related costs, e.g., preparations for the potential commercial manufacture of the drug. This number may be affected by the rate and speed of death accumulation in the study, foreign currency exchange rates, and many other factors, some of which cannot be foreseen today. It is therefore possible that the cost of the Phase 3 clinical trial may be higher than currently estimated.
  
 Ultimately, the decision as to whether CEL-SCI’s drug product candidate is safe and effective can only be made by the FDA and/or by other regulatory authorities based upon an assessment of all of the data from an entire drug development program submitted as part of an application for marketing approval. As detailed in the Risk Factors in this report, the current Phase 3 clinical study for CEL-SCI’s investigational drug may or may not be able to be used as the pivotal study supporting a marketing application in the United States, and, if not, at least one entirely new Phase 3 pivotal study would need to be conducted to support a marketing application in the United States.
  
  Development Agreements for Multikine
  
 In August 2008, CEL-SCI signed an agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., or Teva, that gives Teva the exclusive right and license to market, distribute and sell Multikine, if approved, in Israel and Turkey for treatment of head and neck cancer. The agreement terminates on a country-by-country basis 10 years after the product launch in each country or upon a material breach or upon bankruptcy of either party. The agreement will automatically extend for additional two year terms unless either party gives notice of its intent not to extend the agreement. If CEL-SCI develops Multikine for other oncology indications and Teva indicates a desire to participate, the parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith with respect to Teva’s participation and contribution in future clinical trials.

 Teva has agreed to use all reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approval to market and sell Multikine in its territory at its own cost and expense. Pursuant to the agreement, it is CEL-SCI’s responsibility to supply Multikine and Teva’s responsibility to sell Multikine, if approved by regulatory authorities in the relevant countries. Net sales will be divided 50/50 between the two parties. Teva also initially agreed to fund certain activities relating to the conduct of a clinical trial in Israel as part of the global Phase 3 trial for Multikine. In January 2012, pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement between CEL-SCI, Teva and GCP Clinical Studies Ltd., or GCP, Teva transferred all of its rights and obligations concerning the Phase 3 trial in Israel to GCP. GCP is now operating the Phase 3 trial in Israel pursuant to a service agreement with CEL-SCI.
  
 In July 2011, Serbia and Croatia were added to Teva’s territory, pursuant to a joinder agreement between CEL-SCI and PLIVA Hrvatska d.o.o., or PLIVA, an affiliate of Teva’s, subject to similar terms as described above.
  
 In consideration for the rights granted by CEL-SCI to PLIVA under the joinder agreement, CEL-SCI will be paid by PLIVA (in U.S. dollars):
  
   ● 
 $100,000 upon EMA grant of Marketing Authorization for Multikine;


   ● 
 $50,000 upon Croatia’s grant of reimbursement status for Multikine in Croatia; and


   ● 
 $50,000 upon Serbia’s grant of reimbursement status for Multikine in Serbia.

 
 In November 2000, CEL-SCI signed an agreement with Orient Europharma Co., Ltd., or Orient Europharma, of Taiwan, which was amended in October 2008 and again in June 2010. Pursuant to this agreement, as amended, Orient Europharma has the exclusive marketing and distribution rights to Multikine, if approved by regulatory authorities, for head and neck cancer, naso-pharyngeal cancer and potentially cervical cancer indications in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, the Philippines, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. CEL-SCI has granted Orient Europharma the first right of negotiation with respect to Thailand and China.
  
 The agreement requires Orient Europharma to fund 10% of the cost of the clinical trials needed to obtain marketing approvals in these countries for head and neck cancer, naso-pharyngeal cancer and potentially cervical cancer. Orient Europharma has set up clinical centers for the Phase 3 trial in Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand and has made further financial contributions towards the cost of the Phase 3 clinical trial.
  
                   If Multikine is approved for sale, Orient Europharma will purchase Multikine from CEL-SCI for 35% of the gross selling price in each country. Orient Europharma is obligated to use the same diligent efforts to develop, register, market, sell and distribute Multikine in its territory as with its own products or other licensed products.
  
 The agreement will terminate on a country-by-country basis 15 years after the product approval for Multikine in each country, at which point the agreement will be automatically extended for successive two year periods, unless either party gives notice of its intent not to extend the agreement. The agreement may also be terminated upon bankruptcy of either party or material misrepresentations that are not cured within 60 days. If the agreement ends before the 15 year term through no fault of either party, CEL-SCI will reimburse Orient Europharma for a prorated part of Orient Europhorma’s costs towards the clinical trials of Multikine. If Orient Europharma fails to make certain minimum purchases of Multikine during the term of the agreement, Orient Europhorma’s rights to the territory will become non-exclusive.
  
 CEL-SCI has a licensing agreement with Byron Biopharma LLC, or Byron, under which CEL-SCI granted Byron an exclusive license to market and distribute Multikine in the Republic of South Africa, if approved. This license will terminate 20 years after marketing approval in South Africa or after bankruptcy or uncured material breach. After the 20-year period has expired, the agreement will be automatically extended for successive two year periods, unless either party gives notice of its intent not to extend the agreement.
  
 Pursuant to the agreement, Byron will be responsible for registering Multikine in South Africa. If Multikine is approved for sale in South Africa, CEL-SCI will be responsible for manufacturing the product, while Byron will be responsible for sales in South Africa. Sales revenues will be divided between CEL-SCI and Byron. CEL-SCI will be paid fifty (50%) percent of the net sales of Multikine.
   
   LEAPS
  
 CEL-SCI’s patented T-cell Modulation Process, referred to as LEAPS (Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System), uses “heteroconjugates” to direct the body to choose a specific immune response. LEAPS is designed to stimulate the human immune system to more effectively fight bacterial, viral and parasitic infections as well as autoimmune conditions, allergies, transplantation rejection and cancer, when it cannot do so on its own. Intended to be administered like a vaccine, LEAPS combines T-cell binding ligands with small, disease associated, peptide antigens and may provide a new method to treat and prevent certain diseases.
  
 The ability to generate a specific immune response is important because many diseases are often not combated effectively due to the body’s selection of the “inappropriate” immune response. The capability to specifically reprogram an immune response may offer a more effective approach than existing vaccines and drugs in attacking an underlying disease.

 On September 19, 2017, CEL-SCI announced that it had been awarded a Phase 2 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant in the amount of $1.5 million from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, or NIAMS, which is part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). This grant will provide funding to allow CEL-SCI to advance its first LEAPS product candidate, CEL-4000, towards an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a Phase 1 safety study, by funding IND enabling studies and additional mechanism of action studies, among other preclinical development activities. Work on CEL-4000 is being conducted at CEL-SCI’s research laboratory and Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois in the laboratories of Tibor Glant, MD, Ph.D., Jorge O. Galante Professor of Orthopedic Surgery and Katalin Mikecz, MD, Ph.D. Professor of Orthopedic Surgery & Biochemistry. The SBIR grant was awarded based on published data described below by Dr. Glant's team in collaboration with CEL-SCI showing that the administration of a proprietary peptide using CEL-SCI's LEAPS technology prevented the development, and lessened the severity, including inflammation, of experimental proteoglycan induced arthritis (PGIA or GIA) when it was administered after the disease was induced in animals.
  
 In May 2019, CEL-SCI announced that a newly discovered LEAPS conjugate vaccine acts alone and can complement CEL-4000 therapeutically when administered in combination to an animal model of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This new LEAPS conjugate appears to act on T cell pathways by a new mechanism that is different from the pathways used by the CEL-4000 vaccine. The data was presented at the American Association of Immunologists 103th Annual Meeting (Immunology 2019) by Daniel Zimmerman, Ph.D., CEL-SCI’s Senior Vice President of Research, Cellular Immunology. The work was performed in conjunction with researchers at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois and was funded by the SBIR Phase 2 Grant.
  
 In July 2019, one of CEL-SCI’s collaborators from Rush, Dr. Adrienn Markovics presented new LEAPS data at i-Chem2019, International Conference on Immunity and Immunochemistry. Data presented was for a new second RA vaccine discovered which acts alone and can complement the existing CEL-4000 RA vaccine in an animal model of RA. The combination of the two RA vaccines provided not only broader epitope coverage, but also a greater therapeutic effect than either vaccine alone. The LEAPS work was performed in conjunction with researchers at CEL-SCI on CEL-4000 and a newly discovered LEAPS conjugate, DerG-PG275Cit. Both vaccines were evaluated alone and in combination in the model of proteoglycan [PG] induced arthritis (PGIA) called recombinant PG G1 domain-induced arthritis (GIA), an autoimmune mouse model of RA.
  
 Prior to the SBIR Phase 2 grant, CEL-SCI was awarded a Phase 1 SBIR grant in the amount of $225,000 from NIAMS. This grant funded the development of CEL-SCI’s LEAPS technology as a potential treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease of the joints. The work was conducted at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois in the laboratories of Tibor Glant, MD, Ph.D., Katalin Mikecz, MD, Ph.D., and Allison Finnegan, Ph.D. Professor of Medicine.
  
 With the support of these SBIR grants, CEL-SCI is developing two new drug candidates, CEL-2000 and CEL-4000, as potential rheumatoid arthritis therapeutic vaccines. The data from animal studies using the CEL-2000 treatment vaccine suggests that it could be used against rheumatoid arthritis with fewer administrations than those required by other anti-rheumatoid arthritis treatments currently on the market for arthritic conditions associated with the Th17 signature cytokine TNF-a. The preclinical data for CEL-4000 indicates it could be used against rheumatoid arthritis where a Th1 signature cytokine (IFN-c) is dominant. CEL-2000 and CEL-4000 each have the potential to become a personalized, disease-specific therapy, that acts at an earlier step in the disease process than current therapies, and which may be useful in patients not responding to existing rheumatoid arthritis therapies. CEL-SCI believes this represents a large unmet medical need in the rheumatoid arthritis market.
  
 In February 2017 and November 2016, CEL-SCI announced preclinical data that demonstrate its investigational new drug candidate CEL-4000 has the potential for use as a therapeutic vaccine to treat rheumatoid arthritis. This study was supported in part by the SBIR Phase I Grant and was conducted in collaboration with Drs. Katalin Mikecz and Tibor Glant, and their research team at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, IL.
  
 In March 2015, CEL-SCI and its collaborators published a review article on vaccine therapies for rheumatoid arthritis based in part on work supported by the SBIR Phase 1 grant. The article is entitled “Rheumatoid arthritis vaccine therapies: perspectives and lessons from therapeutic Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System vaccines for models of rheumatoid arthritis” and was published in Expert Review of Vaccines 1 - 18 and can be found online at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25787143.
  
 Using the LEAPS technology, CEL-SCI has also tested in preclinical studies a potential peptide treatment for H1N1 (swine flu) hospitalized patients.  This LEAPS flu treatment is designed to focus on the conserved, non-changing epitopes of the different strains of Type A Influenza viruses (H1N1, H5N1, H3N1, etc.), including “swine”, “avian or bird”, and “Spanish Influenza”, in order to minimize the chance of viral “escape by mutations” from immune recognition. Therefore one should think of this treatment not really as an H1N1 treatment, but as a potential pandemic flu treatment. CEL-SCI’s LEAPS flu treatment contains epitopes known to be associated with immune protection against influenza in animal models. 
  
 In May 2011 NIAID scientists presented data at the Keystone Conference on “Pathogenesis of Influenza: Virus-Host Interactions” in Hong Kong, China, showing the positive results of efficacy studies in mice of LEAPS H1N1 activated dendritic cells (DCs) to treat the H1N1 virus. Scientists at the NIAID found that H1N1-infected mice treated with LEAPS-H1N1 DCs showed a survival advantage over mice treated with control DCs. The work was performed in collaboration with scientists led by Kanta Subbarao, M.D., Chief of the Emerging Respiratory Diseases Section in NIAID’s Division of Intramural Research, part of the National Institutes of Health, USA.
  
   
7


  
 
 In July 2013, CEL-SCI announced the publication of the results of influenza studies by researchers from the NIAID in the Journal of Clinical Investigation (www.jci.org/articles/view/67550). The studies described in the publication show that when CEL-SCI’s investigational J-LEAPS Influenza Virus treatments were used “in vitro” to activate DCs, these activated DCs, when injected into influenza infected mice, arrested the progression of lethal influenza virus infection in these mice. The work was performed in the laboratory of Dr. Subbarao.
  
 Accordingly, even though the various LEAPS vaccine candidates have not yet been given to humans, they have been tested in vitro with human cells. They have induced similar cytokine responses that were seen in these animal models, which may indicate that the LEAPS technology might translate to humans. The LEAPS candidates have demonstrated protection against lethal herpes simplex virus (HSV1) and H1N1 influenza infection, as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent in animals. They have also shown some level of activity in animals in two autoimmune conditions, curtailing and sometimes preventing disease progression in arthritis and myocarditis animal models. CEL-SCI’s belief is that the LEAPS technology, once developed and approved as safe and effective for humans, may be a significant alternative to the vaccines currently available on the market for these diseases.
  
 None of the LEAPS investigational products have been approved for sale, barter or exchange by the FDA or any other regulatory agency for any use to treat disease in animals or humans. The safety or efficacy of these products has not been established for any use. Lastly, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from the early-phase, preclinical-trials data involving these investigational products. Before obtaining marketing approval from the FDA in the United States, and by comparable agencies in most foreign countries, these product candidates must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing which is costly and time consuming and subject to unanticipated delays. There can be no assurance that these approvals will be granted.
  
  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
  
 Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to CEL-SCI’s business. CEL-SCI files patent applications to protect its technologies, inventions and improvements to its inventions that CEL-SCI considers important to the development of its business. CEL-SCI’S intellectual property portfolio covers its proprietary technologies, including Multikine and LEAPS, by multiple issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in key foreign markets.
  
 Multikine is protected by a U.S. patent, which is a composition-of-matter patent issued in May 2005 that, in its current format, expires in 2023. Additional composition-of-matter patents for Multikine have been issued in Germany (issued in June 2011 and currently set to expire in 2025), China (issued in May 2011 and currently set to expire in 2024), Japan (issued in November 2012 and currently set to expire in 2025), and three in Europe (issued in September 2015, May 2016 and October 2017, currently set to expire in 2025 and 2026). The most recent patent issued in October 2017, patent # EP 1 879 618 B1, titled “A Method for Modulating HLA Class II Tumor Cell Surface Expression With A Cytokine Mixture,” addresses Multikine’s mechanism of action to make tumors more visible to the immune system. This new patent is important because, along with the other Multikine issued patents, it addresses how Multikine enables the immune system to recognize and attack the tumor. One way tumor cells evade the immune system is by expressing human leukocyte antigens (HLA) on the tumor cell surface, thus appearing as ‘self’ to the immune cells and therefore the tumor cells are not attacked. It is important to note that the tumors of the Multikine-treated responders in CEL-SCI’s prior Phase 2 studies had no HLA Class II expressed on the cell surface following Multikine treatment as compared to controls. This points to Multikine’s ability to modulate HLA expression on the tumor cell surface, thereby allowing the immune system to recognize and attack the tumor.
 
 In addition to the patents that offer certain protections for Multikine, the method of manufacture for Multikine, a complex biological product, is held by CEL-SCI as a trade secret.
  
 LEAPS is protected by patents in the United States issued in February 2006, April 2007, August 2007, January 2019 and March 2019. The LEAPS patents, which expire in 2021, 2022, 2021 and three in 2032, respectively, include overlapping claims, with composition of both matter (new chemical entity), process and methods-of-use, to maximize and extend the coverage in their current format. One issued U.S. application is a joint application with Northeast Ohio Medical University (“Neoucom”) and CEL-SCI will share the ability to use the patent, unless CEL-SCI licenses the rights to the patent from Neoucom. In October 2017, a patent was issued in Europe for LEAPS, which expires in 2029.
  
 CEL-SCI has four patent applications pending in the United States and one in Europe for LEAPS, which, if issued, would extend protection through 2034, subject to any potential patent term extensions.
  
 As of December 12, 2019, there were no contested proceedings and/or third party claims with respect to CEL-SCI’s patents or patent applications.

  MANUFACTURING FACILITY
  
 Before starting the Phase 3 clinical trial, for reasons related to regulatory considerations, CEL-SCI built a dedicated manufacturing facility to produce its investigational biological product candidate Multikine. This facility produced multiple clinical lots for the Phase 3 clinical trial and has also passed quality systems review by a European Union Qualified Person on several occasions. At the present time, while clinical supplies of Multikine are no longer needed and commercial approval remains subject to the completion of our Phase 3 trial and submission of marketing applications to the FDA and other regulatory authorities, this manufacturing facility is not actively engaged in the production of any drug or biological products. CEL-SCI is currently preparing the manufacturing facility for the potential commercial manufacture of Multikine.
  
 CEL-SCI’s lease on the manufacturing facility expires on October 31, 2028. CEL-SCI completed validation of its manufacturing facility in January 2010. See Item 2 of this report for more information concerning the terms of this lease.
  
  GOVERNMENT REGULATION
  
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels and in foreign countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing and post-approval monitoring and reporting of biologics such as those CEL-SCI is developing. CEL-SCI, along with third party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which it wishes to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of its product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation of Biological Products
  
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before biological product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
   ●
 completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;


   ●
 submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;


   ●
 approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is initiated;


   ●
 performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;


   ●
 preparation of and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, after completion of clinical trials;


   ●
 satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;


   ●
 a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;


   ●
 satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigations to assess compliance with GCPs; and

 Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the U.S., CEL-SCI must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.
  
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial commences at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) or independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), which provides recommendations for whether or not a study should move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may suggest halting the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
  
 For purposes of approval of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three or four sequential phases that may overlap.
  
● Phase 1 — The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses.
  
● Phase 2 — The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
  
● Phase 3 — The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
    
● Phase 4 — In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. FDA may also make these so-called Phase 4 or post-marketing studies a condition to approval of the BLA.
  
 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
  
 BLA Submission and Review by the FDA
  
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators.
  
 In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA’s goal is to review the BLA within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the product relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication and has received a priority review designation, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification and a sponsor’s process to respond to such inquiries. This FDA review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA (for a standard review) and eight months from the date the BLA is submitted (for a priority review) because the FDA has approximately two months after BLA submission to make a “filing” decision.

 After filing the marketing application, the FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve a biological product for marketing unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the data provided in the application, or the manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities for the product are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. The FDA also may refer applications for novel biologic candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval.
  
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the biological product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete but the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may request additional information or clarification, including new clinical studies. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the re-submitted BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
  
 If a product receives regulatory approval, such approval is limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the application. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the biological product, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post- marketing trials or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
  
 Expedited Review and Approval
  
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A fast track designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the PDUFA target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established the new Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Sponsors may request the FDA to designate a breakthrough therapy at the time of or any time after the submission of an IND, but ideally before an end-of-phase 2 meeting with the FDA. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment.

 Fast Track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 
 Post-Approval Requirements
  
 All therapeutic products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approval or licensure are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements under PDUFA for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications containing clinical data. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements, which impose significant procedural and documentation requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements on manufacturers. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. CEL-SCI cannot be certain that it, or CEL-SCI’s present or future suppliers, will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If CEL-SCI is not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may, among other things, take enforcement action or seek sanctions against use, impose restrictions on a product or its manufacturer, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA.
  
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
   ●
 restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


   ●
 fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;


   ●
 refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;


   ●
 product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;


   ●
 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and


   ●
 consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.

 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of unapproved, or “off-label,” uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.

 Orphan Drug Designation
  
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.
  
 In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of 7 years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of CEL-SCI’s products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product before CEL-SCI does, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication CEL-SCI is seeking, or if CEL-SCI’s product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of CEL-SCI’s products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
  
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA to the FDA for review and approval. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
  
  Other U.S. Health Care Laws
  
 CEL-SCI’s sales, promotion, medical education and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. CEL-SCI’s promotional and scientific/educational programs must comply with the anti-kickback provisions of the Social Security Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the False Claims Act, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, the Veterans Health Care Act and similar state laws.
  
 Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet these applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, exclusion from government health care programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers under the False Claims Act in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
  
  Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement in the U.S.
  
 Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products and new drug classes, including biological products such as CEL-SCI’s product candidates. CEL-SCI may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of its products. The product candidates that CEL-SCI develops may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third- party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow CEL-SCI to sell its products on a competitive and profitable basis.
  
   
13


  
 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect CEL-SCI’s ability to sell its products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
  
  Foreign Regulation
  
 In addition to regulations in the United States, CEL-SCI will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of its products to the extent CEL-SCI chooses to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
