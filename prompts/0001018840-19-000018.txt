STRATEGIC PILLARS 
The Company is focused on putting its customers at the center of everything that it does and meeting its customers’ needs wherever, whenever and however they choose to shop. The Company strives to accomplish this through its three strategic pillars: 

• | Inspiring customers;


• | Innovating relentlessly; and


• | Developing leaders.

These strategic pillars reflect the Company’s deep understanding of its customers, developed through in-store and online interactions, social media platforms, mobile applications, online surveys, customer reviews, loyalty programs and various other forms of customer engagement. Through the continued execution of the Company’s strategic pillars and brand playbooks, the Company is aligning product, brand voice and experience around its customers and is building and enhancing capabilities to react to a rapidly evolving retail landscape. 
OVERVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Omnichannel initiatives.     As customer shopping preferences continue to shift and customers increasingly shop across multiple channels, the Company aims to create best-in-class customer experiences and grow profitably across channels by delivering improvements through a continuous test-and-learn approach. Although stores continue to be the primary fulfillment point for orders, the Company believes that the customers’ experience in its stores is complemented by its omnichannel capabilities, a few of which include: 

• | Purchase-Online-Pickup-in-Store, allowing customers to purchase merchandise through one of the Company’s websites or mobile apps and pick-up the merchandise in store, which often times drives incremental in-store sales;


• | Order-in-Store, allowing customers to shop the brands’ online offering while in-store;


• | Reserve-in-Store, allowing customers to reserve merchandise online and try it on in-store before purchase;


• | Ship-from-Store, which allows the Company to ship in-store merchandise to customers and increases inventory productivity; and


• | Cross-channel returns, allowing customers to return merchandise purchased through one channel to a different channel.

The Company also believes that its loyalty programs, Hollister’s Club Cali® and Abercrombie’s A&F Club®, are important parts of its omnichannel strategy as the Company aims to seamlessly interact and connect with customers across all touchpoints. Under these programs, customers accumulate points primarily based on purchase activity and earn rewards as points are converted at certain thresholds. These rewards can be redeemed for merchandise discounts either in-store or online. The loyalty programs continue to provide timely customer insights, creating stronger customer engagement while driving a higher average level of customer spend. In addition, the Company uses its loyalty programs as a tool to stay close to its customers through members-only offers, items and experiences.
Store operations.     The Company’s stores continue to play an essential role in creating brand awareness serving as physical gateways to the brands. Stores also serve as local hubs for online engagement as the Company continues to grow its omnichannel capabilities to create seamless shopping experiences. Hollister and Abercrombie have launched new store prototypes, in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2017, respectively, which are both open and inviting, and include accommodating features such as innovative fitting rooms and omnichannel capabilities. These new store prototypes are tailored to reflect the personality of each brand, with unique furniture, fixtures, music and scent adding to a rich brand experience. Through the enhanced store environment, the Company has seen improved store engagement and greater overall productivity on a smaller footprint.
The Company continues to evaluate and manage its store fleet through its ongoing channel optimization program, which has been designed to address shifts in customer preferences. Actions taken to optimize store productivity include remodeling, rightsizing and closing stores. At the end of Fiscal 2018, the Company operated 861 stores.

The Company operates 20 desktop and mobile websites for its brands globally, which are available in 11 local languages, and four mobile apps.

Mobile engagement continues to grow, with over 70% of the Company’s digital traffic generated from mobile devices in Fiscal 2018. To improve the overall mobile experience, the Company continues to develop and expand its mobile capabilities, including streamlined checkout and increased ease of navigation.
Wholesale, franchise and licensing operations.

As of February 2, 2019, the Company had six wholesale partnerships, primarily internationally. As of February 2, 2019, the Company’s franchisees operated 15 international franchise stores across the brands. These international franchise stores are located in Mexico, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
MERCHANDISE VENDORS
Global sourcing strategy.  The Company depends on its network of third-party vendors to supply compelling, on-trend and high-quality product assortments to its customers. Maintaining close relationships with vendors allows the Company to be responsive and adaptable to customer feedback. The Company partners with vendors that are expected to respect local laws and have committed to follow the standards set forth in our Vendor Code of Conduct, which details our dedication to employing leading practices in human rights, labor rights, environmental responsibility and workplace safety. During Fiscal 2018, the Company sourced merchandise through approximately 150 vendors located throughout the world, with its largest vendor accounting for approximately 11% of merchandise sourced in Fiscal 2018, based on the cost of sourced merchandise. The Company purchased merchandise from vendors in 17 countries during Fiscal 2018, including the United States (“U.S.”), and believes its product sourcing is appropriately distributed among vendors.
In Fiscal 2018, the Company’s vendors were based primarily in Asia, with approximately 36% and 29% of merchandise sourced through China and Vietnam, respectively, based on the cost of sourced merchandise. The Company reduced the percentage of merchandise sourced from China from 42% in Fiscal 2017 and expects to continue to reduce this percentage in future years. In Fiscal 2018, approximately 25% of merchandise sourced globally was imported to the U.S. from China, based on the cost of sourced merchandise. 
The Company’s global sourcing of merchandise is generally negotiated and settled in U.S. Dollars.
Quality assurance and social sustainability.  High quality standards are an integral part of the Company’s identity and the Company’s network of independent manufacturers and suppliers are expected to achieve and maintain these standards. The Company has established supplier quality standards to ensure the high quality of fabrics and other materials used in the Company’s products. Both home office and field employees participate in monitoring suppliers’ compliance with the Company’s product quality standards. Before production begins, all factories, including subcontractors of the factories, undergo a quality assurance assessment to ensure they meet Company standards. All factories are contractually required to adhere to the Company’s Vendor Code of Conduct, go through social audits which include on-site walk-throughs to appraise the physical working conditions and health and safety practices, and review payroll and age documentation. Social audits of the factories are performed at least every two years after the initial audit.
DISTRIBUTION OF MERCHANDISE INVENTORY
The Company’s distribution network is built to deliver inventory to Company-operated and international franchise stores and fulfill direct-to-consumer and wholesale orders with speed and efficiency. Generally, merchandise is shipped directly from vendors to the Company’s distribution centers (“DCs”), where it is received and inspected before being shipped to its stores or direct-to-consumer or wholesale customers. The Company primarily uses one contract carrier to ship merchandise and related materials to its North American stores and direct-to-consumer customers, and several contract carriers for its international stores and direct-to-consumer customers.

COMPETITION
The Company operates in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive retail business environment.
