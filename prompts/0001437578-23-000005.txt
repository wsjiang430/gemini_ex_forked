Item 1. Business
Our Company
For 35 years, Bright Horizons has been a champion for working families — designing and delivering innovative education and care solutions. We are a leading provider of high-quality early education and child care, family care solutions, and workforce education services that are designed to help working families and client employees thrive personally and professionally. We provide services primarily under multi-year contracts with employers who offer early education and child care, back-up care, and educational advisory and other services as part of their employee benefits packages. These benefits help employers support their employees across life and career stages and to improve recruitment, employee engagement, productivity, retention, and career advancement. We are committed to providing the highest quality of education, care and service across all of our offerings.
We are organized in three reportable segments, which are aligned with our service offerings as follows:
•full service center-based child care (approximately 74% of our revenue in 2022);
•back-up care (approximately 20% of our revenue in 2022); and
•educational advisory and other services (approximately 6% of our revenue in 2022).
As of December 31, 2022, we had more than 1,400 client relationships with employers across a diverse array of industries, including more than 215 Fortune 500 companies. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 1,078 early education and child care centers with the capacity to serve approximately 120,000 children and their families in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia, and India.
Our History
Guided by our HEART principles — Honesty, Excellence, Accountability, Respect, and Teamwork — we have operated early education and child care centers for employers and working parents since 1986. In 1998, we transformed our organization through the merger of Bright Horizons, Inc. and Corporate Family Solutions, Inc., both then Nasdaq-listed companies that were founded in 1986 and 1987, respectively. We were listed on Nasdaq from 1998 to May 2008 when we were acquired by investment funds affiliated with Bain Capital Partners LLC (referred to as our “going private transaction”). On January 30, 2013, we completed our initial public offering, and our common stock became listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “BFAM.”
Throughout our history, we have continued to grow while investing in our future. We have extended our international footprint to become a leading provider in the center-based child care market in the United Kingdom and have expanded into the Netherlands and India as a platform for further international expansion. Additionally, on July 1, 2022, we expanded our footprint into Australia with the acquisition of Only About Children (“OAC”), a high-quality operator of approximately 75 early education and child care centers. In the United States, we have grown our partnerships with employer clients by expanding and enhancing our back-up care family supports, including the addition of elder care, virtual tutoring, school-age camps, and pet care; by developing and growing our educational advisory services; and by adding to our other services by acquiring the Sittercity business. We continue to invest in new technologies to better support our full suite of services as well as enhance our customers’ user experience, and we have increased our digital marketing efforts with additional focus on driving use of our services and maximizing enrollment in centers.
Industry Overview and Trends
We compete in the global market for early education and child care services as well as the market for workforce education services offered by clients as benefits to their employees.
The child care industry generally can be divided into center-based and home-based child care. Our full service segment operates in the center-based market, which is highly fragmented. The center-based child care market includes both retail and employer-sponsored centers. The employer-sponsored model has always been central to our business and is characterized by a single employer or consortium of employers entering into a long-term contract for the provision of child care at a center located at or near the employer sponsor’s worksite. We believe we are one of the largest high quality providers of employer-sponsored child care.
Additionally, we operate in the growing market for back-up care, which primarily consists of center-based back-up care, and in-home care. We also operate in the expanding market of educational advisory services, which consists of workforce education, tuition assistance, student loan repayment and related educational advising, as well as college admissions and college financial advisory services. We believe we are one of the largest and highest quality providers of back-up care and educational advisory services.
We believe that the following key factors contribute to growth in the markets for employer-sponsored child care, back-up care, and educational advisory services.
Recognized Return on Investment to Employers
We believe employers across industries are looking at child care solutions, including on-site and near-site child care and other dependent care solutions, to enhance their employee value proposition. We believe employers are looking to deploy creative solutions to address labor challenges and as part of an overall recruitment and retention strategy to attract their workforce back to the office and keeping them engaged onsite. Our broad suite of solutions positions us well to assist employers with these strategies.
Studies conducted through our workforce consulting practice indicate that employer sponsors of center-based child care and back-up care services realize strong returns on their investments, particularly in terms of reduced turnover and increased productivity. We estimate that users of our back-up care services have been able to work an average of six additional days annually that they otherwise would have missed due to breakdowns in child care arrangements. Additionally, according to a 2022 survey of our families, 90% of parents reported enhanced productivity as a result of their employer offering back-up care, and 86% of employees reported their back-up care benefit makes them more committed to their employer. In particular, our ability to continue to deliver a variety of child care support services and solutions to meet the needs of children and families during the pandemic demonstrated the value and importance of our services to our client partners, including the role our services played in ensuring those partners could continue to deliver on their own business priorities. We believe that this return on investment for employers, demonstrated across our full suite of solutions, will result in additional growth in employer-sponsored center-based child care, back-up care and educational advisory services.
Evolving Workforce
We believe the labor challenges brought on by the pandemic have heightened employers’ sensitivity to their employee value proposition, and Bright Horizons’ services can be a significant element of their strategy to address this. While the pandemic impacted the workforce by shifting from traditional office environments to remote work, we believe the need for center-based child care services remains robust and back-up care continues to be a critical support for both remote and office-based employees. Additionally, we expect that employees will continue to return to traditional office environments in the future, and the demand for child care supports for working parents will likewise increase. We also believe there is elevated focus and emphasis on recruitment and retention by employers, as well as on continuing education, training and up-skilling of the existing workforce. Due to the evolution and introduction of new technologies, as well as increased competition for talent, employers are focused on the needs of their employees. We believe that the modern worker values efforts by employers to support employees across life and career stages that help them thrive in the workplace, by providing access to degree and non-degree programs. As automation, digital transformation, and other advances change nearly every facet of the labor market, there is an increased need for the continuing education and up-skilling of the existing workforce.
We believe these growing needs and changing trends, coupled with increased competition for talent, will encourage employers to invest in solutions and supports that enable workers to realize their full professional potential. Investments in center-based early education and child care, back-up care and educational advisory services will help employers meet their strategic goals, bolster employee engagement, recruitment, retention and address benefit equity amongst their workforce. We believe our broad suite of solutions across early education and child care, back-up care and educational advisory services positions Bright Horizons well to be a provider of choice for employers looking to deploy creative and impactful solutions to support their employees and their benefits needs.
Participation of Working Parents in the Workforce
A significant percentage of parents currently participate in the workforce, making child care services and family supports critical to employees and employers and the overall health of the economy. While the pandemic impacted the workforce by temporarily reducing the number of working parents and shifting from traditional office environments to remote or hybrid work, we believe workforce participation levels will return to pre-COVID levels in the future, and the demand for child care supports for working parents will likewise increase. In 2022, women working full-time comprised approximately 50% of the workforce in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, in 2021, 66% of mothers with children under the age of six participated in the workforce in the U.S., and more than 60% of two-parent households comprised dual career earners. Despite workforce demographic shifts related to COVID-19, we believe that the number of working mothers, single and dual working parent families will return to pre-COVID-19 trends over time, resulting in an increasing need for child and dependent care, as well as other workplace solutions that support employees at each life and career stage.
Growing Demand for High-Quality Center-Based Early Education and Child Care Services
We believe that recognition of the importance of early education and consistent quality child care has led to increased interest in high quality center-based early education and child care. There is continued focus on the establishment of objective, standards-based methods of defining and measuring the quality of child care, such as accreditation. We believe robust health and safety protocols and the social, educational and other developmental opportunities presented by center-based care are important factors for families when determining the preferred care options for their children. According to a 2019 study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics, more than 60% of families sought center-based care. In a highly fragmented market comprised largely of center operators lacking scale, we believe clients and families will favor larger industry participants with greater resources to consistently achieve the high quality standards and needs of clients and families. Additionally, child care center closures brought on by the pandemic have resulted in a decrease in overall available capacity. We also believe that the increasing emphasis on the importance of early education and child care, and ongoing efforts to make child care affordable and available for working families, will contribute to further growth in the global early education and child care market as well as the developing markets for back-up care and educational advisory services.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are in the unique position of educating the next generation, and with that responsibility comes the opportunity to make a difference by modeling for children and families an environment that is open, curious, and genuinely interested in what is different, and reflects broad diversity within our teaching staff. Our curriculum and teacher training programs are designed to support inclusive classrooms and create culturally authentic learning environments that celebrate and explore all backgrounds and experiences. We are also exploring with clients how our services support their diversity, equity and inclusion objectives, particularly in workforce education. We believe that our workforce education offerings, along with back-up care and early education, can be a vital element of an employer’s diversity, equity and inclusion strategy. Our services not only help employers attract and retain employees from different backgrounds, but more important, can also help to propel the career growth and development of employees who historically have had less access to higher education.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we are a provider, partner and employer of choice because of our dedication to providing high-quality solutions to those we serve.
Market Leading Service Provider
We believe we are a leader in employer-sponsored center-based child care, back-up care, and educational advisory services, and that the breadth, depth and quality of our service offerings — developed over a successful 35 year history — represent significant competitive advantages. We estimate we have approximately six times more employer-sponsored centers in the United States than our closest competitor. We believe the broad geographic reach of our early education and child care centers and workplace solutions, with targeted clusters of centers in areas where we believe demand is generally higher and where demographics are attractive, provides us with a competitive platform to market our suite of services to new and existing clients.
Our business is anchored in our commitment to consistently provide high-quality service offerings to employers and families. We have designed our child care centers to meet or exceed applicable accreditation and rating standards in all of our key markets, including standards set in the United States by the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs, a division of the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), in the United Kingdom by the Office of Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (OFSTED), and in Australia by the Education Council and Australian Children’s Education and Care Quality Authority (ACECQA). We believe our commitment to achieving accreditation standards offers a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining families and in securing employer sponsorship opportunities as an increasing number of potential and existing employer clients require or expect adherence to accreditation criteria.
Our proprietary curriculum and educational practices are informed by the science of early learning and research on childhood development. Our resources and training programs guide teachers as they transform this research into practice through high-quality learning experiences and evidence-based instructional practices. We also believe that low teacher-to-child ratios and small group sizes are critical factors in delivering our curriculum effectively as well as helping to facilitate more personalized care. Our programs provide teacher-to-child ratios and group sizes that meet or exceed licensing standards.
Dedicated to the highest quality services in every category in which we operate, our standards of quality also extend to our back-up care and educational advisory services, whether care is delivered in Bright Horizons child care centers, through the quality child care centers and in-home care providers participating in our proprietary back-up care network, or advising provided by our team of education experts. In addition to our annual client retention rate of approximately 95%, we have consistently achieved satisfaction ratings of over 90% among respondents in our parent satisfaction surveys, which is a testament to our ability to deliver on our commitment to quality.
Collaborative, Long-Term Relationships with Diverse Customer Base
We have more than 1,400 client relationships with employers across a diverse array of industries, including more than 215 of the Fortune 500 companies, with our largest client contributing 1% of our revenue in 2022 and our largest 10 clients representing approximately 8% of our revenue in the same year. Our business model emphasizes multi-year employer sponsorship contracts where our clients typically fund the development of new child care centers (which are typically owned or leased by the sponsor) at or near their worksites and frequently support the ongoing operations of these centers through operating subsidies.
Our multiple service points with both employers and employees give us unique insight into the corporate culture of our clients and enables us to identify and provide innovative and tailored solutions to address our clients’ specific and evolving needs. In addition to full service center-based child care, we provide access to a multi-national back-up care network and educational advisory support, allowing us to offer various combinations of services and solutions to best meet the needs of specific clients or specific locations for a single client across geographies and life and career stages. We believe our tailored, collaborative approach to employer-sponsored dependent care and educational advising has contributed to an annual client retention rate of approximately 95% for employer-sponsored centers over the past 10 years and has allowed us to cross-sell and expand our service offerings to existing clients.
Market Leading People Practices
Our ability to deliver consistently high-quality care, education and other services is directly related to our ability to attract, retain, motivate and develop our skilled workforce. We have consistently been named as a top employer by third-party sources in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, including being named as one of the “100 Best Companies to Work For” by Fortune magazine 20 times, as well as a great place to work in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands by the Great Place to Work Institute. We have also been named one of the “Top Places to Work” by the Boston Globe 13 times and the Denver Post nine times.
We believe the education and experience of our center leaders and teachers exceed the industry average. In addition to ongoing in-center training, we have an in-house online training university that allows our employees to earn nationally-recognized child development credentials. Additionally, our Horizons Teacher Degree Program provides our early educators the ability to earn an associate and bachelor’s degree in early childhood education completely paid for by Bright Horizons with no out-of-pocket expenses to the employee. We believe this program is unique in our industry and will continue to distinguish us as an employer of choice while helping to retain and incentivize teachers to grow their careers at Bright Horizons.

Capital-Efficient Operating Model Provides Platform for Growth with Attractive Economics
We have a long history of proven financial results despite broader macro-economic fluctuations. With employer sponsors funding the majority of the capital required for new centers developed on their behalf, and our back-up services provided through our own center portfolio and third party providers, we have been able to grow our business with limited capital investment, which has contributed to strong cash flows from operations.
Proven Acquisition Track Record
We have an established acquisition team that pursues targets using a proven framework to effectively evaluate potential transactions with the goal of maximizing our return on investment while minimizing risk. Over the last ten years, we have completed the acquisition of approximately 430 child care centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and the Netherlands, as well as providers of back-up care services and educational advisory and other services in the United States and the United Kingdom, helping us expand our client base, enhance the scope and reach of our service offerings, broaden our technological capabilities, and offer new services. In 2022, we acquired 78 child care centers.
Our Growth Strategy
We believe there are significant opportunities to continue to grow our business globally by executing on the following proven strategies.
Grow Our Client Relationships
•Secure Relationships with New Employer Clients.  Our addressable market includes approximately 13,000 employers, each with at least 1,000 employees, within the industries that we currently serve in the United States and the United Kingdom. Our dedicated sales team focuses on establishing new client relationships and is supported by our workforce consulting practice, which helps potential clients identify the precise offerings that will best meet their strategic goals.
•Cross-Sell and Expand Services to Existing Employer Clients.  We believe there is a significant opportunity to increase the number of our clients that use more than one of our services and to expand the services we provide to existing clients. Since going public in 2013, we have more than doubled the number of our clients who utilize more than one of our services to more than 425 clients as of December 31, 2022.
•Continue to Expand Through the Assumption of Management of Existing Sponsored Child Care Centers.  Periodically, we assume the management of existing centers from the incumbent management which enables us to develop new client relationships, typically with no capital investment and no purchase price payment.
Enable Continued Investments in Quality
We look for opportunities to invest in quality to ensure we fulfill our commitment of research-based early education excellence as a way to enhance our reputation and partnership with our clients, their employees, and the families we serve through enhanced curriculum and enrichment activities, teacher education and development programs, and ongoing program evaluation. For parents and families, we offer timely webinar series and monthly podcasts that reflect current issues facing families and provide parenting tips and insights, as well as share our curriculum with families at home through our online platforms. By developing a strong reputation for high-quality services and facilities, we have been able to support price increases that have kept pace with our cost increases.
Increase Utilization at Existing Centers and Use of Back-up Care and Educational Advisory Services
We are continually looking to increase enrollment levels and utilization in our profit and loss centers in order to achieve continued growth and improved center economics. We look for opportunities to increase the use of our back-up care and educational advisory services, not only by growing client relationships, but also by driving use with existing clients. Over the last two years, we expanded our back-up care offerings to include virtual tutoring and pet care, and broadened our school-age camp programs addressing education and care needs while extending the coverage of our services. We continue to invest in new technologies to better support our full suite of services and to enhance our customers’ user experience to help drive utilization. We have expanded our marketing efforts with additional focus on driving awareness and use of our services, with a focus on maximizing occupancy levels in centers where we can improve our economics with increased enrollment and participant usage of Back-up Care and Educational Advisory services.
Selectively Add New Lease/Consortium Centers and Expand Through Acquisitions
We have typically added between 10 and 15 new lease/consortium centers (as more fully described below) annually, focusing on urban or surrounding markets where demand is generally higher and where income demographics are generally more supportive of our high-quality centers. In addition, we have a long track record of successfully completing and integrating selective acquisitions across all business lines. The domestic and international markets for child care and other work and family support services remain highly fragmented and, as we look to fiscal 2023 and beyond, we will continue to seek attractive opportunities both for center acquisitions and the acquisition of complementary service offerings.
Our Operations
Our services are designed to help families, employers, and their employees solve the challenges of the modern workforce across life and career stages. Our services are comprised of full service center-based child care, back-up care, and educational advisory and other services, which are also our reportable segments. Full service center-based child care includes traditional center-based early education and child care, preschool, and elementary education. Back-up care includes center-based back-up child care, in-home care for children and adult/elder dependents, school-age camps, virtual tutoring, pet care and self-sourced reimbursed care. Educational advisory and other services consist of tuition assistance and student loan repayment program management, workforce education, related educational advising, college advisory services, and Sittercity, an online marketplace for families and caregivers.

Additional segment information is included in Note 18, Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Full Service Center-Based Child Care Services
We provide full service center-based child care at centers located at or near an employer sponsor’s worksite, as well as convenient locations within the community. We operate our centers under two principal business models: a profit and loss (“P&L”) model and a cost-plus model.
Profit and Loss Model: Approximately 75% of our centers operate under the P&L model. Under this model, we retain the financial outcomes of operating the center and are therefore subject to variability in financial performance due to fluctuations in enrollment levels. The P&L model is further classified into two subcategories:
•Sponsor model: Under the sponsor model, we provide early education and child care on an exclusive or priority enrollment basis for the employees of an employer sponsor, and the employer sponsor generally retains responsibility for the development of the child care center (which is owned or leased by the sponsor), as well as pre-opening capital equipment and ongoing maintenance and repair. Arrangements with employer sponsors generally have initial terms ranging from 3 to 10 years with varying terms, renewal and termination options.
•Lease model: Under the lease model, the child care center is typically located near where working parents live and/or work in a property that we lease, and we provide early education and child care services to the employees of multiple employers, as well as to families in the surrounding community. We typically enter into leases with initial terms ranging from 10 to 15 years for these centers, often with renewal options.
When we open a new P&L center, it generally takes two to three years for the center to ramp up to a steady state level of enrollment, as a center will typically enroll younger children at the outset with children aging into the older (preschool) classrooms over time. We refer to centers that have been open for three years or less as “ramping centers.” A center will typically achieve breakeven operating performance between 12 to 24 months and will typically achieve a steady state level of enrollment that supports our average center operating profit by the end of three years, although the time period needed to reach a steady state level of enrollment may be longer or shorter. Centers that have been open more than three years are referred to as “mature centers.”
Cost Plus Model: Approximately 25% of our centers operate under the cost-plus business model. Under this model, we receive a fee from the employer sponsor for managing and operating their center. Additionally, employer sponsors typically provide operating subsidies to support the ongoing provision of child care services to their employees if center operating costs exceed revenue from tuition paid by parents. The employer sponsor typically retains responsibility for the development of the child care center (which is owned or leased by the sponsor), as well as pre-opening capital equipment and ongoing maintenance and repair, and the center is profitable from the outset. Our cost-plus contracts typically have initial terms ranging from three to five years with varying terms, renewal and termination options.
Under all model types, we retain responsibility for all aspects of operating the child care center, including hiring and paying employees, ongoing training, curriculum, contracting with vendors, purchasing supplies, and collecting tuition.
Tuition paid by families generally represents approximately 90% of the revenue generated by this segment and is determined based on the age and developmental level of the child, the child’s attendance schedule (full-time or part-time), the geographic location, and the extent to which an employer sponsor subsidizes tuition. Based on a sample of approximately 360 of our early education and child care centers in the United States, the current average tuition at our centers is $2,350 per month for infants (typically ages 3 to 16 months), $2,200 per month for toddlers (typically ages 16 months to 3 years) and $1,850 per month for preschoolers (typically ages 3 to 5 years). Tuition at most of our early education and child care centers is payable in advance and is typically due monthly.
Historically, annual revenue per center typically averages between $1.6 million and $2.1 million at our centers in North America and averages between $1.2 million and $1.8 million at our international centers, which is primarily driven by the size and capacity of centers. Our North American early education and child care centers have an average capacity of 129 children per location, while our international centers have an average capacity of 86 children per location. Gross margin at our mature centers typically averages between 20% and 25%, with our cost-plus model centers typically at the lower end of that range and our lease centers at the higher end. In 2022, as our center operations continue to recover from the pandemic, annual revenue per center averaged approximately $1.7 million in North America and $1.2 million internationally, which in turn contributed to a contraction in gross margins to approximately 15% for the year.
Cost of services consists of direct expenses associated with the operation of early education and child care centers and is primarily comprised of personnel salaries and benefits, food costs, program supplies and materials, parent marketing and facilities costs, which include occupancy costs and depreciation. Personnel costs are the largest component of a center’s operating costs and comprise approximately 70% of a center’s operating expenses. In a P&L model center, we are often responsible for additional costs that are typically paid or provided directly by an employer sponsor in centers operating under the cost-plus model, such as facilities costs. As a result, personnel costs in centers operating under P&L models will often represent a lower percentage of overall costs when compared to centers operating under cost-plus models.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SGA”) relating to full service center-based child care consist primarily of salaries and benefits (including stock-based compensation costs) for non-center personnel, which includes corporate, regional and business development personnel; accounting, legal and management/advisory fees; information technology; occupancy costs for corporate and regional personnel; and other general corporate expenses.
Back-up Care Services
Back-up care offers family support services for dependents of all ages and provides coverage when regular care breaks down, as well as care coordination tools to assist families with their short and long-term care decisions. We provide back-up care services for children (primarily 0-12 years old) through our own full service centers, dedicated back-up child care centers, school-age camps, and in-home caregivers, as well as through our proprietary back-up care network of quality child care centers and in-home care providers. In addition, we provide back-up care services for adults/elders through our proprietary network of quality in-home care providers, and we offer virtual tutoring for school-age children and adult learners through our network of tutoring service providers, and pet care through third-party providers. We also help to facilitate back-up care services through our self-sourced reimbursed care program.
Traditional back-up care offers families access to a contracted network of more than 4,500 in-home care agencies and center-based providers in locations where we do not otherwise have centers with available capacity or available in-home caregivers. Our dedicated back-up centers are operated in a similar structure to full service centers and are either exclusive to a single employer or have multiple employer sponsors and are part of our back-up care program. Self-sourced reimbursed care is an alternative care program, available to employer sponsors typically when other network care solutions are not available, which provides payments to their employees to assist with the cost of self-sourced dependent care. As we continue to find innovative solutions to help families with their care needs, we have expanded our back-up care solutions to include virtual tutoring and broaden our school-age camp programs that primarily operate during school vacations and the summer months. Care is arranged online or via our mobile application as well as through a 24/7 contact center allowing employees to reserve care in advance or at the last minute. We operate our own contact center in Broomfield, Colorado and we contract with additional contact centers in other geographies to complement our ability to handle demand fluctuations, provide business continuity, and deliver seamless service.
Back-up care revenue is comprised of fees paid by employer sponsors and, to a lesser extent, co-payments collected from users at the time of service. These arrangements generally have contractual terms of three years with varying terms, renewal and termination options. Fees for back-up care services are typically determined based on the number of back-up care uses purchased. Cost of services consist of direct expenses associated with the operation of dedicated back-up centers, fees paid to providers for care delivered as part of their contractual relationships with us, personnel and related direct service costs of the contact centers, and any other expenses related to the coordination or delivery of care and service. SGA related to back-up care is similar to SGA for full service center-based child care, with additional expenses related to the technology necessary to operate this service, the ongoing development and maintenance of the provider network, and additional personnel needed as a result of more significant client management and reporting requirements.
Educational Advisory and Other Services
Our educational advisory services primarily consist of Bright Horizons EdAssist Solutions and Bright Horizons College Coach. Educational advisory services revenue is comprised of fees paid by employer clients for policy consulting, program management, coaching, and subscription content and, to a limited extent, retail fees collected from users at the point of service. Contracts are typically three years in length, with varying terms, renewal and termination options, and fees are generally determined based on the services being provided and the number of program participants. Cost of services consist of personnel and direct service costs of the contact centers, and other expenses related to the coordination and delivery of tuition assistance and student loan repayment program management, and educational advisory and counseling services. SGA related to educational advisory services is similar to SGA for back-up care.
EdAssist by Bright Horizons.  EdAssist provides workforce education, tuition assistance and student loan repayment program management, as well as related educational advising to corporate clients who offer these services as a talent development and workplace benefit to their employees. Our services help employers better align their workplace education programs with their business goals while supporting employees to upskill, re-skill and improve their careers. Program management services are provided through proprietary software for the processing of tuition reimbursement, loan repayment transactions, and analysis of data. We provide educational advising to client employees on a one-on-one basis through our team of advisors who help employees make better decisions regarding their education and financial wellness. Clients can also leverage our EdAssist Education Network of education providers and benefit from pre-negotiated tuition discounts. Customer service is also provided through our contact center in Broomfield, Colorado. EdAssist services derive revenue directly from fees paid by employers.
Bright Horizons College Coach.  Bright Horizons College Coach provides college admissions and college financing advisory services through our team of experts, who have experience working in admissions or financial aid at colleges and universities. We also offer coaching and tools to assist families as they support their children with varying needs across life stages. Advisory services are provided at live/webinar events with expert presenters, through one-on-one coaching, as well as through our online learning center. We work with employer clients who offer these services as workplace benefits to their employees, and we also provide these services directly to families on a retail basis. College Coach derives revenue mainly from employer clients who contract with us for a specified number of workshops, access to our proprietary online learning center and one-on-one advising.
Other Services.  Other services consists of Sittercity, an online marketplace for families and caregivers. Sittercity revenue is generated from subscriptions to a proprietary online search platform and marketplace that helps families find child care (babysitting/nannies), as well as senior care and pet care.
Geography
We operate in two primary regions: (1) North America, which includes the United States and Puerto Rico, and (2) International, which includes the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia and India. The following table sets forth information by geographic region for the year ended December 31, 2022:

Our international business primarily consists of child care centers throughout the United Kingdom, Australia and the Netherlands, with approximately 95% of the revenue generated related to the full service center-based child care segment. As of December 31, 2022, we had 643 centers in North America and 435 international centers. Additional geographical information is included in Note 18, Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Seasonality
Historically, our full service center-based child care and back-up care operations are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations. Demand for early education and child care services has historically decreased during the summer months when school is not in session at which time families are often on vacation or have alternative child care arrangements. In addition, enrollment at our child care centers declines as older children transition to elementary schools. Demand for our services generally increases in September and October coinciding with the beginning of the new school year and remains relatively stable throughout the rest of the school year. Use of our back-up care services tends to be higher when schools are not in session and during holiday periods, which can increase the operating costs of the program and impact the results of operations. Our educational advisory and other services generally have limited seasonal fluctuations.
Results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of, among other things, the performance of existing centers, including enrollment and staffing fluctuations, the number and timing of new center openings, additions from acquisitions and center management transitions, the timing of new client launches in our back-up and educational advisory services, the length of time required for new centers to achieve profitability, center closings, the contract model mix (P&L versus cost-plus) of new and existing centers, the level of sponsorship payments, and general economic conditions.
Marketing
Brand Awareness and Thought Leadership
We market our services and build our brand through virtual events, social media, earned and paid media placements, digital and print advertising, articles and blogs, direct mail, and a robust search engine optimization strategy. Our senior leaders are involved at the national level with education, work/life and early child care advocacy, and we believe that their visibility and involvement helps attract new business. We believe that our proprietary research, events, and the availability of uniquely knowledgeable industry leaders help sustain our brand awareness and position Bright Horizons as a thought leader in the markets where we operate. For employer sponsors and their employees, we conduct our annual Modern Family Index and The Education Index, capturing snapshots of critical market sectors at a particular moment in time. For parents and families, we offer timely webinar series as well as monthly podcasts that reflect current issues facing families.
Timely Approaches that Evolve With the Workplace
We strive to meet clients’ needs as demonstrated by our capacity to pivot as the marketplace shifts, rolling out and marketing new services to meet evolving work environments. Marketing tools have expanded to include text message communication; targeted back-up journeys and campaigns; outreach for flexible care offerings including virtual options such as tutoring and camps; and sharing our curriculum and extension activities with families at home through our online platforms. Outreach for these efforts includes persona-based campaigns for back-to-school and return-to-office support; initiatives aimed at supporting enrolled families including age-based developmental notifications through our parent mobile app; a health, safety and wellness parent newsletter; podcasts; and a parenting exchange workshop series.
Lead Generation and Conversion; Customer Retention
Lead generation and conversion, and increased utilization, as well as customer retention, remain at the heart of our marketing efforts. We partner with employer sponsors to promote our early education and child care centers and other workplace solutions as important employee benefits within their organizations. Our My Bright Horizons is a portal for client employees to instantly access all their Bright Horizons benefits and BH Central, a self-service portal for client liaisons to track real-time benefit use and access materials to support internal marketing efforts, including a newsletter with tailored resource content. Other efforts include local digital advertising, partnerships with parent groups, ramped social efforts, direct mail, and webinars.
Competition
We believe we are a leading provider of employer-sponsored center-based child care, back-up care, and workforce education services. We estimate that we have approximately six times more market share in the employer-sponsored center-based child care market in the United States than our closest competitor. The market for early education and child care services is highly fragmented, and we compete for enrollment and sponsorship of early education and child care centers with a variety of other organizations, including large community-based child care companies, regional child care providers, family day care, nannies, for-profit and not-for-profit full- and part-time nursery schools, public and private elementary schools, and not-for-profit and government-funded providers of center-based child care. Our principal competitors for employer-sponsored centers include KinderCare Education in the United States and Busy Bees in the United Kingdom. We also compete for enrollment on a center-by-center basis with these providers, along with many local and national providers, such as Affinity Education Group, Childbase, CompaNanny, G8 Education, Goddard Schools, Goodstart Early Learning, Guardian Childcare & Education, Learning Care Group, Primrose Schools, and KidsFoundation. Competition for back-up care comes from IAC/Interactivecorp (Care.com) in addition to employee assistance programs and smaller work/life companies. In the educational advisory segment, competition comes from EdCor, Guild Education and InStride.
We believe the key factors in the competition for enrollment are quality, site convenience and cost. We believe many center-based child care providers are able to offer care at lower prices than we do by utilizing less intensive teacher-to-child ratios and offering lower compensation and benefits to their employees. While our child care tuition levels are generally higher than our competitors, we compete primarily based on the convenience of a location at or near a worksite and a higher level of program quality. In addition, some of our competitors may benefit from strong local name recognition (such as established regional providers) or comply, or are required to comply, with fewer or less costly health, safety, and operational regulations than those with which we comply (such as the more limited health, safety and operational regulatory requirements typically applicable to family day care operations in caregivers’ homes). In the wake of COVID-19, we believe our health and safety protocols are market leading and are an important consideration for families and clients. We believe that our primary focus on serving employer clients, underscored by our track record for achieving and maintaining high-quality standards, also distinguishes us from our competitors.
We have and continue to invest in technology to better support our full suite of services to enhance our customers’ user experience, improve utilization levels of our services within our client workforces and across our existing client base, and deliver more efficient and automated support services. Investments to leverage our web and mobile functionality across all of our services, as well as expand mobile capabilities are designed to ensure that our key systems deliver value and provide us with the platform to grow our position in the market. We believe we are well-positioned to continue attracting new employer sponsors due to our extensive service offerings, established reputation, position as a quality leader, and track record of serving major employer sponsors for 35 years.
Human Capital Management
We know that education and care can change lives, and for 35 years Bright Horizons has been changing the way employees and their families live and work. To achieve this mission and to deliver results, we put our HEART Principles at the forefront of everything we do. Our HEART Principles — Honesty, Excellence, Accountability, Respect, and Teamwork — are the underlying tenets of our culture and are guided by the core belief that our people are the foundation to building and sustaining an organization that makes a significant impact in the lives of the children, families and adult learners we serve.
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 29,100 global employees (including part-time and substitute teachers), of whom approximately 3,100 were employed as corporate, divisional and regional employees, and approximately 26,100 were employed at our early education and child care centers and as in-home caregivers. The total number of employees includes approximately 17,350 in North America, 7,300 in the United Kingdom, 2,050 in the Netherlands, 2,350 in Australia, and 50 in India. Corporate, divisional and regional staff members make up our “Home Team” employees, and staff members working at our early education and child care centers, including teachers and support personnel, and in-home caregivers make up our “Field” employees. Employees that work at one child care center, which has been closed since the COVID-19 pandemic, remain represented by a labor union. We have continued to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with this union in good faith.
We believe employers across industries are looking to deploy creative solutions to address labor challenges, enhance their employee value proposition and provide benefits for their workforce to enable their employees to excel both personally and professionally. While our broad suite of solutions positions us well to assist employers with these strategies, our own services and solutions serve as a significant element of our own talent management strategy.
Talent Acquisition
Our business is about people serving people, and our success depends on attracting, developing and retaining talented and highly qualified employees. We are continually investing in resources and creating programs to drive diversity, equity and inclusion, to provide fair and competitive pay and benefits to support our employees’ well-being, and to foster personal growth and career development opportunities. We endeavor to create an environment that rewards performance, enhances our culture and employee experience, and retains and engages our talent.
In 2022, we continued our extensive talent acquisition campaign to recruit teachers and staff and have enhanced the candidate and new hire experience through initiatives such as the 100 Days of Heart onboarding program, an alumni recruitment initiative program and an enhanced employee referral program. As part of our continued commitment to support the well-being of our Bright Horizons team, and to help address the challenges in recruiting and retaining top talent, we continue to make investments with respect to eligible employees in certain markets, to further strengthen our position as an employer of choice:
•Increased pay through off-cycle market adjustments for teachers and staff in a number of key markets.
•Expanded benefits and access to our Tuition Assistance program for Home Team employees.
•Enhanced our mental health and wellness resources through a new and expanded well-being offering.
Our Benefits and Total Rewards
More than 1,400 top employers trust us for proven solutions that support employees, advance careers, and maximize performance, and we offer our own employees the solutions and services we offer to our clients. From on-site child care to back-up care to help handle disruptions in child care gaps, and education programs that build critical skills, we believe our service offerings help our employees achieve more.
We also offer a comprehensive total rewards program aimed at varying health, home-life and financial needs. Our total rewards package, which may vary by geography, includes:
•Competitive pay and healthcare benefits;
•401(k) retirement plans with matching contributions;
•Paid time off;
•Wellness initiatives with benefits relating to nutrition, stress management and financial well-being, mental health, work-life balance and an Employee Assistance Program;
•Child care tuition subsidies for both Field and Home Team employees;
•Tuition assistance programs, including the Horizons Teacher Degree Program which provides direct, no-cost access to an early childhood education degree; and
•Access to back-up care, EdAssist, College Coach and Sittercity.
We believe our total rewards package for teachers and center staff is robust and helps recruit and retain teachers in the industry.
Our Award Winning Culture
We are honored and proud to have a long track record of being named an employer of choice. The following represent some of our most recent awards related to culture, diversity and inclusion that we believe are a product of the strong culture we have built at Bright Horizons and the programs and benefits we offer to our employees.

Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Focus
At Bright Horizons, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are core priorities that we believe are critical to our long-term success by improving the work we do, the services we provide and, ultimately, the value we create. We are an organization made up of employees, children and families from many cultures, backgrounds and experiences and we believe it is vital to have a workplace where all employees feel welcome, comfortable and a sense of belonging and where everyone's unique differences are celebrated and valued. As an organization built around people, having diverse talent at the Board level and throughout our organization helps us recruit and retain talent, reduce turnover and enhance all our offerings and service lines and the education we deliver daily to children and families.
Our Inclusion Vision, in which we are committed to creating inclusive environments where everyone has a sense of belonging and has the opportunity to contribute and thrive in meaningful and impactful ways, guides and defines our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives. To bring this vision to life, we leverage the groups below to facilitate interactive activities, ignite and engage in bold conversations, and lead diversity awareness and inclusive leadership trainings, webinars and discussion groups:
•Inclusion Steering Committee — comprised of senior leaders and executive officers who inform the strategy for Bright Horizons’ overall diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
•Inclusion Council — includes representatives from Bright Horizons business units and functional departments, executive members, and co-chairs of our eight Employee Advisory Groups, and is guided by the Inclusion Steering Committee aimed at creating accountability in this area throughout the organization.
•Employee Advisory Groups — voluntary, company-sponsored, internal associations dedicated to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment within the context of Bright Horizons’ mission, values, goals, business practices, and objectives.
We aim to hire a diverse workforce and we are focused on taking action to make real change, not for a moment in time, but for the long-term. As of December 31, 2022, workforce diversity representation was approximately as follows:
 | Gender (Global) (1) | Racial Diversity (North America Only) (2)
Entire Workforce (3) | 94% | 52% 
Home Team Employees | 77% | 29% 
Field Employees | 96% | 56% 
Senior Leaders (4) | 71% | 20% 
Board of Directors | 50% | 20% 

(1)Gender is defined as percentage of women in the workforce.

Our Investment in Career Growth and Professional Development and our Horizons Teacher Degree Program
We invest in our employees’ career growth. Employee training and development opportunities are critical to our success as they drive our employees’ growth, help develop leaders within our organization (through our leadership institute) and support our delivery of quality services to our clients and the families and learners we serve. We provide a robust, ongoing employee training and career development program that is available to all employees through our online training university. Our blended learning approach means employees have a selection of different learning methods available to them, including live interactive online webinars, face-to-face training for a variety of topics in multiple venues, eLearning modules, and video.
We support our teachers’ development through a number of programs and resources, including an extensive training curriculum and, in the United States, our eCDA (“child development associate”) program to enable us to deliver high quality services.
A central program offering is our Horizons Teacher Degree Program. The program, which is a first-of-its-kind offering in the early education field, removes financial barriers for employees pursuing a degree, including those posed by traditional tuition reimbursement programs, by allowing employees to earn an associate and bachelor’s degree in early childhood education at no-cost. Participants do not have to pay for any expenses out-of-pocket, including tuition, fees and books. Since its inception in 2018, more than 2,000 teachers have enrolled and more than 600 have graduated.
Our Employee Engagement
Retaining and developing our workforce starts with our employees. At Bright Horizons we regularly listen to employees through our regular surveys and forums. Hearing directly from our employees helps us understand the employee experience, including evolving priorities related to workplace environment, employee relations, pay and benefits, flexibility, and career growth opportunities, all of which are critical to our mission to be and remain an employer of choice and a great place to work. During 2022, we surveyed employees to ensure that we continued to support their needs and focus on their priorities. Additionally, we periodically deploy shorter pulse surveys to ensure our action planning is realizing the desired impact. This approach enables us to act on real-time information and to take targeted action in response to feedback, such as expanding our benefits and compensation opportunities and to develop enhanced benefits offerings, including new mental health and wellness supports and fostering culture and community through our Better Together teams and The Bright Horizons Foundation for Children.
Our Citizenship
We support the communities in which we work and live, and we encourage our employees to do the same. We proudly stand with our many employees who give their time to non-profit organizations, awarding grants to their chosen charities in recognition of their volunteer work in their communities. We also work alongside our employees to support the Bright Horizons Foundation for Children® and its important mission to bring Bright Spaces® to children and families in homeless shelters and similar agencies helping at risk children and families, supporting our employees with Brightening Lives activities, and Field and Home Team fundraising events.
Intellectual Property
We believe our name and logo have significant value to our operations. We own and use various registered and unregistered trademarks covering the names Bright Horizons® and Bright Horizons Family Solutions®, our logo, and a number of other names, slogans and designs. We frequently license the use of our registered trademarks to our clients in connection with the use of our services, subject to customary restrictions. We actively protect our trademarks by registering the marks in a variety of countries and geographic areas, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, India, and other countries in Asia. These registrations are subject to varying terms and renewal options. However, not all of the trademarks or service marks have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business, and we are aware of persons using similar marks in certain countries in which we operate. Meanwhile, we monitor our trademarks and vigorously oppose the infringement of any of our registered marks as appropriate. We do not hold any patents. We hold copyright registrations for certain materials that are important to the operation of our business, and we generally rely on common law protection for those copyrighted works which are not critical to the operation of our business. We enter into agreements with our employees and other parties with which we do business to limit access to and disclosure of our technology and other proprietary information. We also license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our business and such licenses are not individually or in the aggregate material to our business.
Regulatory Matters
Our business operates in multiple jurisdictions, and we are subject to various national and regional laws and rules and regulations, including labor, licensing, health, fire and safety, and data privacy requirements and standards.
The following discussion highlights our key areas of focus. For a discussion of the risks associated with the laws and regulations that may materially impact us, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Licensing and Child Care Centers
The laws and regulations relating to the provision of child care are numerous and complex. In most jurisdictions where we operate, our child care centers are required by law to meet a variety of operational requirements, including minimum qualifications and background checks for our center personnel as well as teacher-to-child ratios and various labor, licensing, and health, fire and safety regulations. Regulations may also impact the design and furnishing of our centers. We believe that our centers and operations comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations.
Health and Safety
The health, safety and well-being of children, families and staff is our top priority. We adhere to rigorous health, hygiene, and disinfecting practices. Our protocols were developed in consideration of state and local public health guidelines and our partnership with medical professionals and experts that specialize in pediatric infectious diseases. We have health and safety personnel and a Vice President of Global Safety dedicated to supporting our centers and other operations to ensure compliance with our policies and practices, and to ensure that we set the highest standards in all areas.
We employ a variety of security measures at our early education and child care centers, which typically include secure electronic access systems, as well as sign-in and sign-out procedures for children, among other site-specific security measures. In addition, our trained teachers and clear sightline center designs help ensure the health and safety of children. Our early education and child care centers are designed to minimize the risk of injury to children by incorporating features such as child-sized amenities, rounded corners on furniture and fixtures, age-appropriate toys and equipment and cushioned fall zones surrounding play structures.
Each center is further guided by policies and procedures that address protocols for safe and appropriate care of children and center administration. These policies and procedures establish protocols in various areas, including the safe handling of food and medications, managing child illness or health emergencies, and a variety of other critical aspects of care to ensure that centers meet or exceed all mandated licensing standards. These policies and procedures are reviewed and updated continuously by a team of internal experts, and center personnel are trained on center practices using these policies and procedures. Our proprietary We Care system supports proper supervision of children and documents the transitions of children to and from the care of teachers and parents or from one classroom to another during the day.
We require the child care centers and in-home care providers that participate in our proprietary back-up care network to comply with our standards of quality, including caregiver screening and background checks, and training. The delivery of our back-up care services is subject to ongoing oversight and monitoring to ensure the health and safety of the children and adults we care for.
Environmental
Our operations, including the selection and development of the properties that we lease or own, and any construction or improvements that we make at those locations, are subject to a variety of national and local laws and regulations, including environmental, zoning and land use requirements. In addition, we have a practice of conducting site evaluations on each freestanding or newly constructed or renovated property that we own or lease. We have no known material environmental liabilities at this time.
Facilities
Our early education and child care centers are primarily operated at or near work-site locations and vary in design and capacity in accordance with employer sponsor needs and regulatory requirements. Our North American early education and child care centers typically have an average capacity of 129 children, and our international locations have an average capacity of 86 children. As of December 31, 2022, our early education and child care centers had a total licensed capacity of approximately 120,000 children, with the smallest center having a capacity of 15 children and the largest having a capacity of approximately 500 children.
We believe that attractive, spacious and child-friendly facilities with warm, nurturing and welcoming atmospheres are an important element in fostering a high-quality learning environment for children. Our centers are designed to be open and bright and to maximize visibility for supervision. We devote considerable resources to equipping our centers with child-sized amenities, indoor and outdoor play areas comprised of age-appropriate materials and design, family hospitality areas and computer centers. Commercial kitchens are typically present in those centers where regulations require that hot meals be prepared on-site.
