Item 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Piedmont Lithium Inc. (“Piedmont Lithium,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company”) is a development stage company advancing a multi-asset, integrated lithium business in support of a clean energy economy and United States (“U.S.” or “America”) and global energy security. We plan to supply lithium hydroxide to the electric vehicle and battery manufacturing supply chains in North America by processing spodumene concentrate produced from assets we own or in which we have an economic interest. Our portfolio of projects includes our proposed Tennessee Lithium Project and our proposed, fully-integrated Carolina Lithium Project, which are currently under development in the southeastern U.S., and our strategic investments in lithium assets in Quebec, Canada and Ghana, West Africa. 
We currently expect spodumene concentrate production to come online in Quebec in the first half of 2023 and first commercial shipments are anticipated in the third quarter of 2023. Subject to obtaining permits, approvals, and financing, we plan to obtain spodumene concentrate through our offtake agreement in Ghana beginning in late 2024 or 2025, produce lithium hydroxide in Tennessee beginning in 2025 or 2026, and to produce spodumene concentrate and lithium hydroxide in North Carolina beginning in 2026 or 2027.
Piedmont Lithium is incorporated in the State of Delaware. We maintain executive offices at 42 E. Catawba Street, Belmont, NC, 28012, and our telephone number is (704) 461-8000. Our website address is www.piedmontlithium.com. Shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “PLL” and our chess depository interests (“CDIs”), each representing 1/100th of a share of our common stock, are traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”), also under the symbol “PLL.”
Change in Fiscal Year End
Effective January 1, 2022, we changed our fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31. The six-month period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, served as a transition period. Our fiscal year for 2022 commenced on January 1, 2022, and ended on December 31, 2022. See our Transition Report on Form 10-KT (“Transition Report”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 28, 2022. References to years ended prior to December 31, 2021, are for a twelve-month period ended June 30.
Foreign Currencies
Our consolidated financial statements have been presented in our reporting currency, U.S. dollars. Prior to June 30, 2020, our functional currency was the Australian dollar. The change in functional currency was triggered by our increased exposure to the U.S. dollar and our expectation that future operating and capital costs will be predominantly in U.S. dollars. The change in functional currency was applied prospectively from June 30, 2020, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). 
Gains and losses arising from translations or settlements of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income. Foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the change in functional currency are included in “Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax,” and gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are presented in “Foreign currency translation adjustments” in the consolidated financial statements.
Unless otherwise indicated, all references to “$” are to U.S. dollars, all references to “AUD” are to Australian dollars, and all references to “CAD” are to Canadian dollars.
Redomiciliation
The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Piedmont Lithium Pty Ltd (formerly named Piedmont Lithium Limited) (“Piedmont Australia”), our Australian predecessor and now a wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement under Australian law, which was approved by Piedmont Australia’s shareholders on February 26, 2021, and the Federal Court of Australia on May 5, 2021 (collectively referred to as “Redomiciliation”). As part of the Redomiciliation, we changed our place of domicile from Australia to the State of Delaware in the U.S., effective May 17, 2021.
Prior to the Redomiciliation, Piedmont Australia’s ordinary shares were listed on the ASX, and Piedmont Australia’s American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”), each representing 100 of Piedmont Australia’s ordinary shares, were traded on Nasdaq. Following the 
Table of Contents

approval of the Redomiciliation, we moved our primary listing from the ASX to Nasdaq and retained an ASX listing via CDIs, each representing 1/100th of a share of common stock of Piedmont Lithium Inc.
Pursuant to the Redomiciliation, holders of Piedmont Australia’s ordinary shares received one (1) CDI in Piedmont Lithium Inc. for each ordinary share held in Piedmont Australia on the Redomiciliation record date; and holders of ADSs in Piedmont Australia, each of which represented 100 Piedmont Australia ordinary shares, received one (1) share of common stock of Piedmont Lithium Inc. for each ADS held in Piedmont Australia on the Redomiciliation record date.
All issued and outstanding shares of our common stock have been retroactively adjusted in these consolidated financial statements to reflect the 100:1 ratio and share consolidation as if these events had occurred on July 1, 2018.
Our Segment
We have one operating segment, which is also our reportable segment. Our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), manages our operations on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources.
Strategy
Our strategic goal is to become a leading producer of lithium hydroxide in North America, supplied by geographically diverse and sustainable spodumene assets. North American demand for large vehicles and the custom of driving relatively long distances, combined with automakers’ plans for and commitments to electric vehicle production, should continue to expand the demand for North American manufactured lithium hydroxide. We believe our global portfolio of hard rock lithium assets should support a level of estimated lithium hydroxide production that will dramatically increase current production of lithium hydroxide in North America. 
Our plan is to produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide from spodumene concentrate. We believe spodumene concentrate represents the lowest-risk and most commercially scalable raw material source for the production of lithium hydroxide. Within our production process, we expect to use the innovative Metso:Outotec alkaline pressure leach process (“Metso:Outotec Pressure Leach Technology”) as well as a number of manufacturing processes commonly used in the lithium industry today. We plan, as part of our sustainability goals within our overall environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) strategy, to develop our greenfield operations in Tennessee and North Carolina as two of the most sustainable lithium hydroxide production operations in the world.
Our portfolio of projects and strategic equity investments are being developed on a measured timeline to provide the potential for both near-term cash flow and long-term value maximization. At production, we expect to have an estimated lithium hydroxide manufacturing capacity of 60,000 metric tons per year, as compared to the current total estimated U.S. lithium hydroxide production capacity of 15,000 metric tons per year. In support of our strategy, we continue to evaluate opportunities to further expand our resource base and production capacity.
Developing an Integrated Lithium Production Business—Key Projects
Quebec
Piedmont Lithium owns an equity interest of 25% in Sayona Quebec Inc. (“Sayona Quebec”), which owns full interests in North American Lithium (“NAL”), the Authier Lithium Project, and the Tansim Lithium Project. These projects are located in the Abitibi region of Quebec, Canada. Additionally, we own an equity interest of approximately 14% in Sayona Mining Limited (“Sayona Mining”), which in turn owns 75% of Sayona Quebec. We also hold an offtake agreement with Sayona Quebec for the greater of 113,000 metric tons per year or 50% of spodumene concentrate production at market prices, subject to a price floor of $500 per metric ton and a price ceiling of $900 per metric ton, on a life-of-mine basis.
The restart of NAL is proceeding as the necessary permits have been transferred or acquired, all operational leadership has been hired, a four-year mining contract has been awarded for the operation of NAL’s open pit mine, and initial commissioning activities have commenced. While potential delays in restart activities could defer the start date of production, we expect NAL to begin spodumene concentrate production in the first half of 2023. 
Depending upon the successful commencement of production and ability to produce nominal 6% spodumene concentrate, shipments of spodumene concentrate from NAL could commence in 2023. We have entered into offtake agreements with two customers to provide them with spodumene concentrate from NAL. Both of these offtake agreements contain market-based pricing mechanisms.
In addition to spodumene mining and concentrate production, NAL’s complex also includes a partially completed lithium carbonate 
Table of Contents

facility, which was developed by a prior operator of NAL. In the event Piedmont Lithium and Sayona Mining decide to jointly construct and operate a lithium conversion plant through their jointly-owned entity, Sayona Quebec, then spodumene concentrate produced from NAL would be preferentially delivered to that conversion plant upon commencement of conversion operations. Any remaining spodumene concentrate not delivered to a jointly-owned conversion plant would first be delivered to Piedmont Lithium up to our offtake right and then to third parties. 
Sayona Quebec previously announced the commencement of a prefeasibility study for the completion NAL’s lithium carbonate facility. Study results are expected in the first half of 2023. Further evaluation of the production of lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide in Quebec may follow completion of the prefeasibility study. For Sayona Quebec to proceed with the construction and operation of a lithium carbonate conversion plant or lithium hydroxide conversion plant, approvals are required from both Piedmont Lithium and Sayona Mining.
Ghana
We own an equity interest of approximately 9% in Atlantic Lithium Limited (“Atlantic Lithium”) and have the ability to earn a 50% equity interest in Atlantic Lithium’s spodumene projects in Ghana, West Africa. This interest includes an offtake agreement for 50% of annual production of spodumene concentrate from the Ewoyaa Lithium project (“Ewoyaa”), at market prices on a life-of-mine basis. Ewoyaa is Atlantic Lithium’s flagship project in the Cape Coast region of Ghana and located approximately 70 miles from a major port via a national highway. We anticipate the development of the Ewoyaa project to be key for delivering spodumene concentrate to our planned Tennessee Lithium plant for conversion to lithium hydroxide. 
In September 2022, Atlantic Lithium announced the successful completion of a prefeasibility study for Ewoyaa, demonstrating the potential of Ewoyaa to produce low-cost spodumene concentrate using a dense medium only processing technique.
In October 2022, Atlantic Lithium announced it had submitted the mining lease application for Ewoyaa to the Minerals Commission of Ghana. Subject to the receipt of the mining lease, approval of environmental studies, and other statutory requirements, construction may begin at Ewoyaa between the end of 2023 and the first half of 2024 with first spodumene concentrate production between the end of 2024 and the first half of 2025. 
Tennessee Lithium
Our proposed Tennessee Lithium project (“Tennessee Lithium”) is expected to be a world-class lithium hydroxide production facility located within McMinn County near Etowah, Tennessee. With first production targeted by the end of 2025 or the first half of 2026, the facility is expected to produce 30,000 metric tons per year of lithium hydroxide, doubling the current estimated U.S. production capacity of 15,000 metric tons per year. The plant is expected to be one of the most sustainable lithium hydroxide operations in the world utilizing the innovative Metso:Outotec Pressure Leach Technology. Use of this technology is expected to reduce solid waste, create fewer emissions, lower carbon intensity, and improve capital and operating costs relative to incumbent technologies.
In October 2022, Piedmont Lithium was selected for a $141.7 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) to construct Tennessee Lithium. The grant is expected to support project development on a cost-sharing basis. Tennessee Lithium was included among the initial projects funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles and the electrical grid and for materials and components currently imported from other countries. The grant will not be final until Piedmont Lithium and the DOE have agreed to specific terms and conditions of the grant. Once terms and conditions are finalized, funding of the grant will remain subject to satisfaction of conditions set forth in those terms.
In August 2022, we awarded a front-end engineering design (“FEED”) contract to Kiewit Engineering Group Inc. (“Kiewit”), a leading U.S. based engineer, procure, and construct (“EPC”) firm. Kiewit is working with Primero USA Inc. (“Primero”), an EPC firm specializing in lithium projects. We expect FEED, which commenced shortly after the contract award, to be completed in the first half of 2023. Permit applications for Tennessee Lithium are progressing, and subject to receipt of all material required permits, completion of FEED, and project financing, we expect to sign an EPC contract for the construction of Tennessee Lithium. Contingent upon the timely receipt and completion of items discussed above, we expect to begin construction in 2023 or the first half of 2024 with first production of lithium hydroxide targeted by the end of 2025 or the first half of 2026.
Carolina Lithium
Our proposed, fully-integrated Carolina Lithium project (“Carolina Lithium”) is a development stage, hard rock lithium project located within the Carolina Tin-Spodumene Belt of North Carolina and in close proximity to lithium markets. Carolina Lithium is expected to consist of a mining operation, concentrator, and lithium hydroxide conversion plant. In December 2021, we completed a feasibility 
Table of Contents

study, which estimated a project capital investment requirement of approximately $1 billion, inclusive of potential recovery of byproduct mineral resources. The project is expected to produce 30,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide per year at full capacity. Due to the expected quality of this hard rock lithium asset, integration of the operation, existing infrastructure, and proximity to lithium and byproduct markets, we believe Carolina Lithium will be one of the lowest cost lithium hydroxide manufacturing operations in the world.
We are currently engaged in permitting activities with state and local agencies for Carolina Lithium. In August 2021, we submitted a mining permit application to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s (“NCDEQ”) Division of Energy, Minerals, and Land Resources (“DEMLR”). We are currently in the process of responding to additional information requests made by DEMLR in connection with our mining permit application, and we have until May 2023 to respond. A Prevention of Significant Deterioration – Title V Air Permit application has been submitted to the NCDEQ Division of Air Quality and was deemed complete in February 2023.
Our goal in 2023 is to obtain the necessary material state permits for the project. After we receive the requisite permits, we will apply for a rezoning of our project followed by a special use permit from Gaston County, NC. Once we have received the rezoning and special use permit approvals, we expect to commence construction and begin production of lithium hydroxide by the end of 2026 or the first half of 2027. 
Strengths
We believe that we are well-positioned to successfully execute our business strategies primarily due to our following competitive strengths:
•U.S.-based company—With our Redomiciliation to the U.S. in 2021, Piedmont Lithium can benefit from America’s policies aimed at supporting growth in the domestic battery supply chain and reducing reliance on foreign nations. These policies include the Inflation Reduction Acts’s (“IRA”) Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X), which is available only to U.S. taxpayers and is expected to provide a credit equal to 10% of annual production costs. The IRA’s Clean Vehicle Tax Credit (Section 30D) for qualifying light electric vehicle purchases requires escalating usage of domestic critical minerals, which we expect to supply. These credits are in addition to the grant and loan opportunities available through the DOE, including our $141.7 million grant selection for Tennessee Lithium and the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing loan program to which we have applied. 
•Potential for near-term production from past-producing assets—Through our equity investment in Sayona Quebec, we established an offtake agreement and successfully acquired an interest in the past-producing NAL operation. Sayona Quebec is actively working toward first production at NAL. We believe NAL will restart spodumene concentrate production in the first half of 2023, begin commercial shipments in the second half of 2023, and achieve full production by the end of 2023 or the first half of 2024.
•Scale and diversification of resources—Today, we own or hold equity investments in three significant spodumene resources located in Quebec, Ghana, and North Carolina. Our Carolina Lithium project is located within the Carolina Tin-Spodumene Belt. Since January 2021, we have made investments in key spodumene resources and have established strategic partnerships with Sayona Mining and Atlantic Lithium. We continue to pursue opportunities to complement our business through additional acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and investments. 
•Advantageous locations and infrastructure—NAL is located in the Abitibi region of Quebec, a well-established mining district. The region provides access to infrastructure and is geopolitically advantageous. NAL is near the major mining town of Val-d’Or, Quebec, with access to rail, hydropower, and a skilled labor workforce. NAL also has an existing spodumene mine, concentrator and other substantial on-site infrastructure already in place. The Ewoyaa project is located in the Cape Coast region of Ghana with available power infrastructure nearby and direct highway access to Accra (approximately 60 miles). Ewoyaa also is approximately 70 miles from the deep-water Port of Takoradi, providing reasonable transport of spodumene concentrate as the feedstock for our planned Tennessee Lithium operation. Tennessee Lithium is located within the North Etowah Industrial Park in McMinn County, Tennessee. The region is home to a manufacturing workforce as well as power infrastructure, rail, highways, and nearby riverways. Carolina Lithium is well situated in a historical lithium region within the developing Battery Belt. The area features access to road and rail infrastructure, a highly skilled labor force, low-cost and low-carbon sources of baseload grid power, and research and development centers for lithium manufacturing. 
•Strategic funding—We are evaluating a variety of funding options to support development objectives aimed at maintaining shareholder value in the capital markets. In February 2023, we received $75 million from LG Chem, Ltd (“LG Chem”) in exchange for common shares in Piedmont Lithium in conjunction with a multi-year spodumene concentrate offtake agreement. We were selected for a $141.7 million DOE grant for Tennessee Lithium, and we have submitted Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing loan applications for both Tennessee Lithium and Carolina Lithium. The grant will not 
Table of Contents

be final until Piedmont Lithium and the DOE have agreed to the specific terms of the grant. Once the terms have been finalized, funding of the grant will remain subject to satisfaction of conditions set forth in those terms. Strategic partnerships, offtake prepayments, mineral royalties, and other opportunities are also being considered to support the development of our projects and equity investments. 
•Greenfield opportunities—Tennessee Lithium and Carolina Lithium are being designed as new operations, which offers the opportunity to leverage modern technologies, systems, and procedures. We expect to utilize the innovative Metso:Outotec Pressure Leach Technology to convert spodumene concentrate to lithium hydroxide at both U.S. projects. This technology is expected to provide a relative advantage in capital and operating costs and supports our ESG strategy to create a more sustainable operating profile as compared to other hard rock lithium conversion methods.
•Highly experienced management team—Our leadership team includes professionals with core skills and experience in the management, operations, sales, and marketing of lithium manufacturing. The team has broad backgrounds and a long history of acquiring, developing, financing, and operating mining, energy, lithium, and chemical projects. 
Marketing, Sales, and Principal Markets
On July 31, 2020, we entered into a strategic partnership with Ion Carbon & Mineral, LLC to form Pronto Minerals, LLC, for the purpose of marketing and selling byproducts, specifically quartz, feldspar, and mica, produced by our proposed Carolina Lithium project. We continue to explore potential strategic partnership and sales, offtake, and marketing agreements that will benefit the development of the Company’s assets as well as the U.S. electric vehicle supply chain.
Customers
While we are not yet in production, we have begun to sign offtake agreements with customers. 
On January 2, 2023, we entered into an amended offtake agreement with Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”) to provide spodumene concentrate from NAL in Quebec. The agreement commits us to sell 125,000 metric tons of spodumene concentrate from our offtake agreement with Sayona Quebec. The term of the agreement is three years, beginning on January 2, 2023, with the start-of-production in the second half of 2023 through the end of 2025, and pricing is determined by a market-based mechanism. The three-year term can be extended for an additional three years upon mutual agreement.
On February 16, 2023 we entered into a spodumene concentrate offtake agreement with LG Chem. The agreement commits us to sell 200,000 metric tons of spodumene concentrate from our offtake agreement with Sayona Quebec. The term of the agreement expires four years from the date of first shipment, which is anticipated to occur by the third quarter of 2023, with the final shipment expected in the third quarter of 2027. Pricing is determined by a market-based mechanism.
Competition and Market Barriers
We compete with other mineral and chemical processing companies in connection with the acquisition of suitable exploration properties and the engagement of qualified personnel. Many of our competitors possess greater financial resources and technical facilities than we do. Although we aspire to be a leading lithium hydroxide producer in North America, the lithium mining and chemical industries are fragmented. We are one of many participants in these sectors. Many of our competitors, as compared to us, have been in business longer, have established more strategic partnerships and relationships, and have greater financial accessibility.
While we compete with other exploration companies in acquiring suitable properties, we believe there will be readily available purchasers of lithium chemical products or other industrial minerals if they are produced from any of our owned or leased properties. The price of our planned products may be affected by factors beyond our control, including fluctuations in the market prices for lithium, supplies of lithium, demand for lithium, and mining activities of others.
If we identify lithium mineralization that is determined to be of economic grade and in sufficient quantity to justify production, additional capital would be required to develop, mine, and sell that production. Our strategic partnerships, in which we have equity investments, face similar challenges as discussed above.

Government Regulations
Overview
Exploration and development activities for our projects are subject to extensive laws and regulations, which are overseen and enforced by multiple U.S. federal, state, and local authorities as well as foreign jurisdictions. These applicable laws govern exploration, development, production, exports, various taxes, labor standards, occupational and mine health and safety, waste disposal, protection and remediation of the environment, protection of endangered and protected species, and other matters. Various permits from government bodies are required for drilling, mining, or manufacturing operations to be undertaken, and we cannot be assured such permits will be received. Environmental laws and regulations may also, among other things:
•require notice to stakeholders of proposed and ongoing exploration, drilling, environmental studies, mining, or production activities;
•require the installation of pollution control equipment;
•restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with exploration, drilling, mining, lithium hydroxide manufacturing, or other production activities;
•limit or prohibit drilling, mining, lithium manufacturing or other production activities on lands located within wetlands, areas inhabited by endangered species and other protected areas, or otherwise restrict or prohibit activities that could impact the environment, including water resources;
•impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from current or former operations on or for any preexisting environmental impacts from our projects;
•require significant reclamation obligations in the future as a result of our mining and chemical operations; and
•require preparation of an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement.
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may impose substantial costs on us, subject us to significant potential liabilities, and have an adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position. Violations and liabilities with respect to these laws and regulations could result in significant administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups, natural resource damages, permit modifications and/or revocations, operational interruptions and/or shutdowns, and other liabilities, as well as reputational harm, including damage to our relationships with customers, suppliers, investors, governments or other stakeholders. The costs of remedying such conditions may be significant, and remediation obligations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Federal, state, and local legislative bodies and agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes in these regulations, or the interpretations thereof, could require us to expend significant resources to comply with new laws or regulations or changes to current requirements and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, other than with respect to the permitting activities of Carolina Lithium and Tennessee Lithium, we have not been required to spend material amounts on compliance regarding environmental regulations.
Permits
Obtaining and renewing governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process and involves numerous jurisdictions, public hearings, and possibly costly undertakings. The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within our control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority. We may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary for our planned operations, or the cost and time required to obtain or renew such permits may exceed our expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could delay the exploration, development and/or operation of our projects. See “Risk Factors—We will be required to obtain governmental permits in order to conduct development and mining operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming, and there is no certainty that all necessary permits for our operations will be granted.”
Tennessee Lithium
In October 2022, we submitted a Conditional Major Non-Title V air permit application to Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (“TDEC”) Air Pollution Control for the proposed lithium hydroxide site to be located in the North Etowah Industrial Park in McMinn County, Tennessee. We received a request for additional information in November 2022. The response to this request was provided in December 2022. Our application was deemed completed in January 2023 and is subject to ongoing review.
Additional permits for our Tennessee Lithium project will be required, including, but not limited to, a U.S. Army Corp of Engineers 404 jurisdictional determination, construction stormwater permit, a municipal wastewater permit by Etowah Utilities, various 
Table of Contents

driveway permits issued by McMinn County, and waste disposal permits. The building permit process will include design reviews by the McMinn County Economic Development Authority.
Carolina Lithium
In November 2019, we were granted a Clean Water Act Section 404 Standard Individual Permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”) for our integrated Carolina Lithium project.
In July 2022, we received an updated Clean Water Act Section 401 Individual Water Quality Certificate from the NCDEQ Division of Water Resources for the Carolina Lithium project.
In August 2021, we submitted a mining permit application to NCDEQ’s DEMLR, and have subsequently received two requests for additional information. We responded to the first request for additional information in December 2021, and we are currently in the process of responding to the second request for additional information, which is due in May 2023. 
In September 2021, Gaston County updated its Unified Development Ordinance (“UDO”) which, in part, defined operational requirements for new mines and quarries in the county. As required by the UDO updates, new mines and quarries must operate on industrially-zoned property within the county and obtain a Special Use Permit approved by the Gaston County Board of Commissioners. At this time, we remain in pre-application consultation with Gaston County and have not submitted a rezoning application or a special use application.
We hold a Synthetic Minor Construction and Operation Permit issued by the NCDEQ’s Division of Air Quality (“DAQ”) for our property in Kings Mountain, NC. In June 2022, we submitted an application to modify the received air permit to incorporate the use of Metso:Outotec Pressure Leach Technology. Our application is currently on hold as further refinements to the process are being made.
In January 2022, we submitted a determination request to DAQ in connection with Carolina Lithium. In March 2022, we received a response to this request informing us that Carolina Lithium would require a Title V Prevention of Significant Deterioration permit (“Title V Permit”). In August 2022, we submitted our Title V Permit application and our application was deemed complete in February 2023 and is subject to ongoing review.
In January 2022, we received guidance that Carolina Lithium was not eligible for a North Carolina General Stormwater Permit. After further evaluation and testing, it was determined that the site would be covered by a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit. In December 2022, we submitted applications for two permits covering the mine and concentration operations, and the lithium hydroxide conversion plant to the NCDEQ Division of Water Resources. Both permits applications are currently under review.
Exploration and evaluation activities for our Carolina Lithium project included drilling, which is authorized under a general permit initially approved in 2017 by the NCDEQ and updated in April 2019, October 2019 and June 2021. We have reclamation obligations under this permit, pursuant to which we will be obligated to reclaim all disturbed drill pads and temporary roads to the approximate original contours, and will seed with grass and straw to stabilize any disturbances. Generally, we are required to affect such reclamation within 14 days following drilling. We have concluded that these reclamation obligations are immaterial.
We may be required to obtain additional permits and approvals for Carolina Lithium including, but not limited to, a municipal wastewater permit by the City of Gastonia Wastewater Treatment, a road abandonment approved by the North Carolina Department of Transportation (“NCDOT”) and Gaston County under North Carolina General Statute 136-63, an encroachment permit for an at-grade rail crossing issued by NCDOT, various driveway permits issued by NCDOT, a Gaston County Watershed Permit approved by the Gaston County Planning Department, various building permits approved by the Gaston County Planning Department, explosives permits approved by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and hazardous chemical permits issued by Gaston County Fire Officials.
U.S. Federal Legal Framework
Carolina Lithium and Tennessee Lithium will be required to comply with applicable environmental protection laws and regulations and licensing and permitting requirements. The material environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations that we must comply with include, among others, the following U.S. federal laws and regulations:
•National Environmental Protection Act (“NEPA”), which requires careful evaluation of the environmental impacts of mining and lithium manufacturing operations that require federal approvals;
Table of Contents

•Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and its amendments, which governs air emissions;
•Clean Water Act (“CWA”), which governs discharges to and excavations within the waters of the U.S.;
•Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), which governs the management of solid waste;
•Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), which imposes liability where hazardous substances have been released into the environment (commonly known as Superfund); and
•Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, which established the primary safety and health standards regarding working conditions of employees engaged in mining, related operations, and preparation and milling of the minerals extracted, as well as the Occupation Safety and Health Act, which regulates the protection of the health and safety of workers in lithium manufacturing operations.
Our operations will also be subject to state environmental laws and regulations, including but not limited to, laws and regulations related to the reclamation of mined lands, which may require reclamation bonds to be acquired prior to the commencement of mining operations and may require substantial financial guarantees to cover the cost of future reclamation activities.
Solid and Hazardous Waste
RCRA, and comparable state statutes, affect our operations by imposing regulations on the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous wastes and on the disposal of non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements.
In addition, CERCLA can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or legality of conduct on classes of persons who are statutorily responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons can include the current and former owners, lessees, or operators of a site where a release occurs, and anyone who disposes or arranges for the disposal of a hazardous substance. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to strict, joint, and several liability for the entire cost of cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for other costs, including response costs, alternative water supplies, damage to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners, workers, and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the indoor or outdoor environment. Each state also has environmental cleanup laws analogous to CERCLA. Hazardous wastes may have been previously handled, disposed of, or released on or under properties currently or formerly owned or leased by us or on or under other locations to which we sent waste for disposal. These properties and any materials disposed or released on them may subject us to liability under CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate disposed wastes or property contamination, contribute to remediation costs, or perform remedial activities to prevent future environmental harm.
Air Emissions
The federal CAA and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from numerous sources through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. Major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent, federally imposed permitting requirements. Air pollution regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain air permits, and comply with stringent permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay our operations, and we may be required to incur capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related obligations. Administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air pollution regulations or permits are generally resolved by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. Alternatively, regulatory agencies could require us to forego construction, modification, or operation of certain air emission sources.
Clean Water Act
The CWA imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the pollution of protected waters, including mineral processing wastes, into waters of the U.S., a term broadly defined to include, among other things, certain wetlands. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters. The CWA provides for civil, criminal, and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges, both routine and accidental, of pollutants. It imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with discharges of oil or hazardous substances. State laws governing discharges to water also provide varying civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, and impose liabilities in the case of a discharge of petroleum or its derivatives, or other hazardous substances, into state waters. In addition, the EPA has promulgated regulations that require permits to discharge storm water runoff, including

discharges associated with construction activities. In the event of an unauthorized discharge of wastes, we may be liable for penalties and costs.
Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may also be required to develop and implement spill prevention, control, and countermeasure plans in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of fill materials to regulated waters, including wetlands, without a permit from the USACE.
In May 2015, the EPA issued a final rule that attempted to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the U.S., The agency repealed this rule in September 2019 and replaced it with the Navigable Water Protection Rule in April 2020, which narrowed federal jurisdictional reach relative to the 2015 rule. The repeal and replacement of the 2015 rule is currently subject to litigation, and the scope of the jurisdictional reach of the CWA may, therefore, remain uncertain for several years, with a patchwork of legal guidelines applicable to various states potentially developing. We could incur increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas to the extent they are required.
NEPA
NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. The NEPA process involves public input through comments, which can alter the nature of a proposed project either by limiting the scope of the project or requiring resource-specific mitigation. NEPA decisions can be appealed through the court system by process participants. This process may result in delaying the permitting and development of projects or increase the costs of permitting and developing some facilities.
Endangered Species Act
The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. Some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service continues its effort to make listing decisions and critical habitat designations where necessary. To date, the ESA has not had a significant impact on our operations. However, the designation of previously unprotected species as being endangered or threatened could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions in areas where the species are known to exist.
Foreign Legal Framework
Our proposed projects with Sayona Mining and Atlantic Lithium will be required to comply with all environmental laws and regulations in Quebec, Canada and Ghana, West Africa, respectively.
Human Capital Management

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Our Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and includes statistical data, market data and other industry data and forecasts, which we obtained from market research, publicly available information and independent industry publications and reports that we believe to be reliable sources.
Certain information included or incorporated by reference in our Annual Report may be deemed to be “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of applicable securities laws. Such forward-looking statements concern our anticipated results and progress of our operations in future periods, planned exploration and development of our properties and plans related to our business and other matters that may occur in the future. These statements relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management. All statements contained herein that are not clearly historical in nature are forward-looking, and the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “could,” “can,” “shall,” “should,” “would,” “leading,” “objective,” “intend,” “contemplate,” “design,” “predict,” “potential,” “plan,” “target” and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual events or results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in our Annual Report include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to risks related to:

By its nature, forward-looking information involves numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, known and unknown, that contribute to the possibility that the predictions, forecasts, projections or other forward-looking statements will not occur. Although we have attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, believed, estimated, or expected. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Except as otherwise required by the securities laws of the U.S., we disclaim any obligation to subsequently revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. We qualify all the forward-looking statements contained in our Annual Report by the foregoing cautionary statements.
CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING DISCLOSURE OF MINERAL PROPERTIES
We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of both U.S. and Australian securities laws with respect to mining matters. In the U.S., we are governed by the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), including Regulation S-K, Subpart 1300 (“S-K 1300”) thereunder. In Australia, we are governed by the 2012 Edition of the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (“JORC Code”). Both sets of reporting standards have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of confidence in the disclosures being reported but may at times embody different approaches or definitions.
On October 21, 2021, we announced an inaugural mineral resources estimate for our Carolina Lithium project. On December 14, 2021, we announced the completion of a bankable feasibility study (“BFS”) for our Carolina Lithium project, which included an initial estimation of mineral reserves. These estimates of mineral resources and mineral reserves are compatible with both S-K 1300 and JORC Code. A Technical Report Summary with respect to our estimated mineral reserves was filed as exhibit to our Transition Report for the period ending December 31, 2021. This Technical Report Summary was amended to include certain information as required by Item 1300 of Regulation S-K . The Amended Technical Report Summary dated February 27, 2023 is included as Exhibit 96.1 and filed with our Annual Report.
