ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate Overview

We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing treatments intended to modulate the endocannabinoid system (the “ECS”) and related signaling pathways, including a solid-state composition of cannabidiol (“CBD cocrystal”), with improved pharmaceutical-like properties which could have a meaningful impact on cannabinoid-based drug development. Our management team is highly experienced and has a successful history of development, regulatory approval and commercialization of pharmaceuticals. 

Our product candidate pipeline broadly leverages leading scientific methodologies to ECS modulation, balances risk across mechanism of action and stages of development, and represents a comprehensive approach in utilizing the power of the ECS to develop pharmaceuticals for patients with unmet healthcare needs. In addition to our cocrystal program, we are currently evaluating ART27.13, which we currently anticipate will enter a Phase 1b/2a trial for cancer related anorexia in the second quarter of 2020, and ART26.12, which is being studied as an endocannabinoid modulator and cancer therapeutic and is in the late pre-clinical stage.

The crystal structure of cannabidiol (“CBD”) is known to exhibit polymorphism, or the ability to manifest in different forms. Polymorphism can adversely affect stability, dissolution, and bioavailability of a drug product and thus affect its quality, safety, and efficacy. We have developed a proprietary cocrystal composition of CBD, which we have designated as ART12.11. We believe our cocrystal exists as a single crystal form and as such is anticipated to have advantages over other forms of CBD that exhibit polymorphism. Anticipated advantages of this single crystal structure include improved stability, solubility, and a more consistent absorption profile. We believe these features will result in more consistent bioavailability and may lead to improved safety and efficacy.

U.S. and international patent applications including broad claims to our novel cocrystal composition of CBD were filed in late 2018 and a continuation filing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) in April 2019. Composition claims are generally known in the pharmaceutical industry as the most desired type of intellectual property and, if issued, should provide for long lasting market exclusivity for our CBD cocrystal drug product candidate. In addition, due to the reasons outlined above, we believe that our CBD cocrystal will have superior pharmaceutical properties compared to non-cocrystal CBD products under development at other competing companies.

In addition to our own internal discovery research, we are currently developing two patent protected product candidates that we obtained through our in-licensing activities. Our first program is a synthetic small molecule program, ART27.13, being developed for cancer-related anorexia. ART27.13 is a peripherally-restricted high-potency dual CB1 and CB2 receptor agonist which was originally developed at AstraZeneca plc (“AstraZeneca”). We have exercised our option to exclusively license this product candidate through the NEOMED Institute, a Canadian not-for-profit corporation, renamed adMare in June 2019 (“NEOMED”). In Phase 1 single dose studies in healthy volunteers and a multiple ascending dose study in otherwise healthy patients with back pain conducted by AstraZeneca, ART27.13 exhibited an attractive pharmacokinetic and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profile and was well tolerated within the target exposure range. It also exhibited dose-dependent and potentially clinically meaningful increases in body weight. Importantly, the changes in body weight were not associated with fluid retention or other adverse effects and occurred at exposures without central nervous system (“CNS”) side effects. Discussions with U.K. regulators indicate there is a potential pathway for development of ART27.13 for the treatment of cancer-related anorexia, which affects approximately 60% of advanced stage cancer patients. We are planning to initiate a Phase 1b/2a clinical study of cancer-related anorexia with ART27.13 upon successful completion of manufacturing new study material and when the regulatory authorities in the U.K. which we currently anticipate will be in the second quarter of 2020, with initial data expected by year end.

Our second in-licensed program is a platform of small-molecule inhibitors for fatty acid binding protein 5 (“ FABP5”), based upon scientific developments achieved at Stony Brook University (“SBU”) which we have designated ART26.12. To date, SBU has received nearly $4 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health to begin developing these candidates. Fatty acid binding proteins (“FABPs”) are attractive therapeutic targets, however, their high degree of similarity among the various types has proven challenging to the creation of drugs targeting specific FABPs. FABP5 is believed to specifically target and regulate one of the body’s endogenous cannabinoids, anandamide (“AEA”). While searching for a FABP5 inhibitor to regulate AEA, we believe researchers at SBU discovered the chemistry for creating a highly specific and potent small molecule inhibitor for FABP5. In addition to its potential as an endocannabinoid modulator, FABP5 is also an attractive target for cancer drug development. Large amounts of human clinical epidemiological and animal model data support FABP5 as a well validated oncology therapeutic target, especially for triple negative breast cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer. We licensed exclusive world-wide rights to these inhibitors from SBU. The program is in the final stages of lead optimization, and we plan to initiate regulatory enabling studies thereafter. We anticipate clinical studies in cancer can begin in 2021.

We are developing our product candidates in accordance with traditional drug development standards and plan to make them available to the general public via prescription or physician orders only after obtaining marketing authorization from a regulatory authority, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). Our management team has experience developing and commercializing ethical pharmaceutical products, including several first-in-class therapeutics. Based upon our current management’s capabilities and the future talent we may attract, we expect to retain rights to internally develop and commercialize products, however, we may seek collaborations with partners in the biopharmaceutical industry when that strategy serves to maximize value for our stockholders.

Background

The ECS is composed of cannabinoid receptors, endogenous receptor ligands (“endocannabinoids”) and their associated transporter mechanisms, as well as enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids, and has emerged as a considerable target for pharmacotherapy approaches of numerous human diseases. As a widespread modulatory system, the ECS plays important roles in the CNS, development, synaptic plasticity, and the response to endogenous and environmental factors.

The modulation of the ECS can be effected by using selective or non-selective agonists, partial agonists, inverse agonists, and antagonists of the cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2. The CB1 receptor is distributed in brain areas associated with motor control, emotional responses, motivated behavior and energy homeostasis. In the periphery, CB1 is ubiquitously expressed in the adipose tissue, pancreas, liver, gastrointestinal tract, skeletal muscles, heart and the reproductive system. The CB2 receptor is mainly expressed in the immune system regulating its functions, and is upregulated in response to tissue stress or damage in most cell types. The ECS is therefore involved in pathophysiological conditions in both the central and peripheral tissues.

The actions of endogenous ligands can be enhanced or attenuated by targeting mechanisms that are associated with their transport within the cellular and extra cellular matrix as well as their synthesis and breakdown. Small molecule chemical modulators of the ECS can be derived from the cannabis plant (“phytocannabinoids”), can be semi-synthetic derivatives of phytocannabinoids or endocannabinoids, or can be completely synthetic new chemical entities. We plan to develop approaches within our portfolio that address receptor binding and endocannabinoid transport modulation using only synthetic new chemical entities. Future approaches may also involve targeting synthesis or breakdown enzymes.

ECS targeting cannabinoid-based medicines are already approved and used to treat numerous medical conditions. The ECS is further implicated in many disease states within the peer reviewed literature including conditions which involve the regulation of food intake, central nervous system, pain, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune and inflammation, behavioral, antiproliferative and reproductive functions. These areas of ECS pathophysiology are aligned with our therapeutic areas of focus: pain, inflammation, anorexia, cardiovascular, and cancer.

Business Strategy

Our objective is to develop and commercialize ethical pharmaceutical products that provide physicians access to the therapeutic potential of cannabinoid therapeutics and other modulators of the ECS for their patients. We intend to pursue technologies and compounds that offer promising therapeutic approaches to cannabinoid-based therapies, including mimetics of naturally-occurring cannabinoids and fully synthetic cannabinoids, as well as compounds that promote the effectiveness of the ECS.
Corporate History

We were initially incorporated as Knight Knox Development Corp. in the State of Nevada on May 2, 2011 with a plan to develop an online business using our domain www.offeritnow.com to generate revenues by (i) selling ad space to third party websites, (ii) charging a fee for listing items for sale on the Company’s website or (iii) selling items on the auction section of our website. On November 18, 2016, James Manley, who had served as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and director resigned from the Company. On that date, Peter O’Brien acquired all 1,000,000 shares of common stock that had previously been owned by James Manley and assumed the positions of President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and director of the Company.

On November 11, 2016, we registered a fully owned subsidiary in Ireland, Trinity Reliant Ventures Limited and on June 2, 2017 we registered a fully owned subsidiary in the UK, Trinity Research and Development Limited, to oversee our European operations. To date, activities within the subsidiary have consisted of raising equity capital and performing research and development activities in the United Kingdom.

On January 19, 2017, a majority of stockholders and the Board approved a change of our name to Reactive Medical, Inc. to pursue the licensing, development and commercialization of cannabinoid-based therapeutics.

On April 3, 2017, Mr. O’Brien resigned from the positions of President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of our Company and the Board appointed Gregory D. Gorgas to assume those positions. At that time, Mr. Gorgas also became a member of our Board. Mr. O’Brien retained his seat on the Board and was appointed Senior Vice President – European Operations. Mr. Gorgas purchased a total of 293,333 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.001 per share, which shares are subject to a repurchase option by us should Mr. Gorgas’ employment end prior to the fourth anniversary of his employment. Mr. O’Brien has since resigned from the Board on March 1, 2019.

In clinical development studies with NEOMED’s prior sponsor, NEO1940 was dosed in over 200 subjects. From 2007 to 2008, NEO1940 was evaluated in five phase I clinical trials under its original sponsor, AstraZeneca. NEO1940 was administered orally in 205 patients and its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were investigated. Four of these studies were single dose or Single Ascending Dose (“SAD”) studies. An initial SAD study was conducted in Caucasian population. The program was completed with another study performed in a Japanese population. The two other single dose studies aimed at measuring a pharmacodynamics effect (Proof-of-Principle or POP studies) on analgesia using the capsaicin test in one case of the third molar extraction model in the other case. The last phase I study was a Multiple Ascending Dose (“MAD”) study, where patients with chronic lower back pain received NEO1940 for a scheduled period of 12 days. Further details of the studies are found in Table 1.

NEO1940 demonstrated, in general, an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in the safety endpoints. The profile of the observed safety effects was generally typical of cannabinoids and the majority of the adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity. A maximum tolerated dose was defined by the frequency and severity of adverse events. A dose dependent increase in body weight was observed in the MAD study. In three out of the five phase I studies, analgesia in acute pain models was also measured as an end-point; no convincing analgesic efficacy has been seen in any of these studies.

The Stony Brook University Relationship

On January 18, 2018, we entered into a license agreement (the “Stony Brook Agreement”) with the Research Foundation at Stony Brook University (the “Foundation”) which agreement became effective on that same date. The Stony Brook Agreement provides us with an exclusive license under certain licensed patents of the Foundation (the “Patent Rights”) to develop, make, manufacture, have made, use, sell, have sold, import, export, and offer for sale Patent Product(s) (as defined in the Stony Brook Agreement) and Other Product(s) (as defined in the Stony Brook Agreement) worldwide in all fields, including without limitation the field of human therapeutics. The Stony Brook Agreement has an effective date of January 18, 2018 (the “SBU Effective Date”).

Pursuant to the Stony Brook Agreement, we will pay to the Foundation an upfront fee and annual license maintenance fees, beginning on the first anniversary of the SBU Effective Date and annually thereafter on each anniversary of the SBU Effective Date.

We will also be required to pay a low-single digit royalty on net sales on any patent products (the “Royalties”). The Stony Brook Agreement provides for a reduction of the Royalties in certain cases. We will also pay to the Foundation, beginning in the first calendar year of the first commercial sales, an annual minimum royalty fee (the “Annual Minimum Royalty”). The Annual Minimum Royalty will be credited against the total Royalties due for the calendar year in which the Annual Minimum Royalty.

We will also be required to make payments for the following milestones:

Research & Development

In view of the urgent need for new and more effective drugs, we intend to combine innovative science and accelerated clinical development to create and develop novel therapies using cannabinoid-based medications and similar compounds which modulate the ECS. Our current research and development efforts have been limited to investigative work surrounding cannabinoids, including creating and developing novel formulations, and evaluating potential opportunities to license technologies from pharmaceutical companies and leading research institutions. Our principal research efforts to date have been with the University of Nottingham, U.K. and various CRO’s in the U.S. and U.K.
Scientific Approach

We intend to create, acquire, and develop a full spectrum of therapeutics, each of which has the potential to modulate the ECS for human health. The principal scientific platforms of our strategy are as follows:

· | Synthetics and Mimetics. We plan to acquire rights to intellectual property for research and clinical stage assets developed within the pharmaceutical industry and leading research institutions which utilize synthetically developed mimetics or alternatives to plant-based cannabinoids. Our efforts to secure rights to synthetics and novel compounds led us to the NEOMED Agreement with NEOMED for the Compound. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | New Chemical Entities. We expect to license intellectual property rights for research stage platforms and new chemical entities developed within leading academic institutions under which we may develop programs that modulate the ECS or related signaling pathways. These programs may involve the use of compounds which are neither plant based nor synthetically-derived cannabinoids, but are instead compounds that have been shown to have promising potential for modulating the ECS. Our initiatives for this strategy led us to the license novel technology from Stony Brook University, which we expect to be a core program for the Company.


Our Board and management have experience developing and commercializing ethical pharmaceutical products, including several first-in-class therapeutics. As we build our pipeline and advance our research and clinical development programs, we will evaluate partnerships with large pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies where applicable. Based upon our management’s current experience and the future talent we may attract, we plan to retain rights to develop and commercialize products on our own. However, we will seek collaborations with biopharmaceutical partners should that strategy serve to maximize the value for our stockholders.

Two of our development programs were licensed from established and respected organizations that have already conducted pre-clinical research and, in some cases, clinical research. Our science and regulatory teams are leveraging this research to speed development and commercialization timelines across our growing portfolio. Our current pipeline encompasses multiple mechanisms for endocannabinoid system modulation. The specific programs that are currently in development are set forth below.


· | ART12.11 – Our novel solid-state CBD composition is targeted for development in Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”), and rare/orphan diseases. The rare/orphan disease strategy is supported by recent FDA actions with other company programs containing CBD, however, we intend to prioritize pain conditions associated with inflammation and neurologic conditions such as epilepsy and PTSD.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | ART26.12 – Our FABP5 inhibitor program is intended for treatment of breast cancer, prostate cancer, and neuropathic and nociceptive pain. Our near-term goal is to identify a lead development compound and assess its activity in models of cancer and pain. Once one or more lead compound(s) are selected, we intend to initiate regulatory-enabling studies. 
· | ART27.13 – ART27.13 is our name for the compound formerly known as NEO1940 and AZD1940. We intend to develop a formulation suitable for treatment of anorexia/weight loss associated with cancer. ART27.13 has been in 205 subjects in prior clinical studies and is clinic-ready for a Phase 1b/2a study in anorexia associated with cancer.

Competition

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and an emphasis on proprietary products. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.

We plan to compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnological and other related markets with therapeutics that demonstrate clinical utility, have an acceptable safety profile and target commercially attractive indications characterized by previously unmet medical need.

Our potential competitors, which include pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies such as Novartis International AG, Helsinn Therapeutics (U.S.), Inc.,Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc., and GW Pharmaceuticals OLC, may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved medicines than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain approval from the FDA or other regulatory agencies for their medicines more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.

Government Regulation

United States

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and the implementing regulations promulgated thereunder. The failure to comply with requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.

An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:


· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin; 
· | approval by an independent institutional review board, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCPs to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
· | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications; 
· | review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 
· | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
· | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; 
· | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and 
· | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. 

Foreign Jurisdictions

In addition to regulations in the United States, a manufacturer is subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions to the extent they choose to sell any drug products in those foreign countries. Even if a manufacturer obtains FDA approval of a product, it must still obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. For other countries, outside of the European Union, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary.

In the European Union, marketing authorizations for medicinal products may be obtained through different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU Member States. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. On the other hand, a decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other concerned EU Member States of an assessment of an application for marketing authorization conducted by one EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State. In accordance with the mutual recognition procedure, the sponsor applies for national marketing authorization in one EU Member State. Upon receipt of this authorization the sponsor can then seek the recognition of this authorization by other EU Member States.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), prohibits U.S. businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries.
International Laws

In Europe, and throughout the world, other countries have enacted anti-bribery laws and/or regulations similar to the FCPA. Violations of any of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.

There are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain required patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.

Other Healthcare Laws

Our business operations and current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, consultants, customers and patients, may expose us to broadly applicable state and federal fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws constrain the business and financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute our products. Such laws include:

· | the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a U.S. healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | U.S. federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which, among other things, impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the U.S. government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. government. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label; 
· | the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the health care fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
· | in addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by covered entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers as well as their business associates that perform certain services for or on their behalf involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information; 
· | the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the government information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to the government ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members; and 
· | analogous state and non-U.S. laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by the patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical and device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; and state and non-U.S. laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.


16


Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities may conclude that some of our business practices, including our promotional activities and interactions with our customers do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other health regulatory laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other U.S. healthcare programs, additional integrity reporting and oversight obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. If any of the above occur, it could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

U.S. Healthcare Reform

In the U.S. and some non-U.S. jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.

Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. For example, in the U.S., in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”), was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers. Among the ACA’s provisions of importance to our business are the following:


· | implementation of a 2.3% excise tax imposed on manufacturers and importers for certain sales of medical devices, which, due to subsequent legislation will not go into effect until January 1, 2020; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
· | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and 
· | establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending that began on January 1, 2011. 


There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the current administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA and we expect such challenges and amendments to continue. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, on January 22, 2018, Executive Office of the President of the United States signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the 2.3% excise tax imposed on manufacturers and importers for certain sales of medical devices, the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, and the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, led to aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional action is taken by Congress. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

Further, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to bring transparency to product pricing and reduce the cost of products and services under government healthcare programs. Additionally, individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. Moreover, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what products to purchase and which suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs.

Employees

We currently have one (1) full-time employee, Mr. Gregory D. Gorgas, serving as President and CEO, and three (3) contractors, Mr. Peter O’Brien, serving as our Senior Vice President - European Operations, Mr. Jason Baybutt, serving as our Senior Vice President – Finance, and Dr. Steven Reich, M.D., serving as our Chief Medical Officer. We also engage multiple consultants and advisors who provide services on a part-time basis. Our employee, contractors and consultants conduct or oversee all day-to-day operations of the Company including technical development, research, and administration. We have no unionized employees. We currently have no retainers or minimum financial commitments with any of our consultants, contractors or service providers. We consider relations with our employee, consultants, and contractors to be satisfactory. 

Implications of being an Emerging Growth Company

We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. An “emerging growth company” may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:


· | being permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of “Selected Financial Data” and related “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this prospectus;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended; 
· | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 
· | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 


We may use these provisions until the last day of our fiscal year ending August 2020. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such period, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such period.

We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.

In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, delaying the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we are not subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
