Item 1. Business.
Overview and History
 Heritage Global Inc. (“HGI”, and together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Florida in 1983 under the name “MedCross, Inc.” Our name was changed to “I-Link Incorporated” in 1997, to “Acceris Communications Inc.” in 2003, to “C2 Global Technologies Inc.” in 2005, to “Counsel RB Capital Inc.” in 2011, and to Heritage Global Inc. in 2013. The most recent name change more closely identifies HGI with its core auction business, Heritage Global Partners, Inc. (“HGP”).
 In 2014, HGI acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock in National Loan Exchange, Inc. (“NLEX”), a broker of charged-off receivables in the United States and Canada. As a result of this acquisition, NLEX operates as one of our wholly owned divisions.
 The organization chart below outlines our basic domestic corporate structure as of December 31, 2018.

industrial machinery and equipment, industrial inventories, real estate, accounts receivable portfolios, intellectual property, and entire business enterprises.
 Our asset liquidation business began operations in 2009 with the establishment of Heritage Global LLC (“HG LLC”). In addition to acquiring turnkey manufacturing facilities and used industrial machinery and equipment, HG LLC arranges traditional asset disposition sales, including liquidation and auction sales. In 2011, HG LLC acquired 100% of the business of Equity Partners HG LLC f/k/a EP USA, LLC (“Equity Partners”), thereby expanding our operations. Equity Partners is a boutique M&A advisory firm and provider of financial solutions for businesses and properties in transition.   
 In 2012, we increased our in-house asset liquidation expertise with our acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity of HGP, a global full-service auction, appraisal and asset advisory firm, and launched Heritage Global Partners Europe (“HGP Europe”). Through our wholly-owned subsidiary Heritage Global Partners UK Limited, we opened three European-based offices, one each in the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain. 
 In 2014, we again expanded our asset liquidation operations with the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity of NLEX. NLEX is the largest volume broker of charged-off receivables in the United States and Canada, and its offerings include national, state and regional portfolios on behalf of many of the world’s top financial institutions. The NLEX acquisition is consistent with our strategy to expand and diversify the services provided by its asset liquidation business. 
 As a result of the events and acquisitions outlined above, management believes that our expanded global platform will allow us to achieve our long term industry leadership goals.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 50 employees: 28 are employed by HGP, 14 by NLEX, and eight by Equity Partners.  
 Industry and Competition
 Our asset liquidation business consists primarily of the auction, appraisal and asset advisory services provided by HGP, mergers and acquisitions advisory services provided by Equity Partners, and the accounts receivable brokerage services provided by NLEX. Our asset liquidation business also includes the purchase and sale, including at auction, of industrial machinery and equipment, real estate, inventories, accounts receivable and distressed debt. The market for these services and assets is highly fragmented. To acquire auction or appraisal contracts, or assets for resale, we compete with other liquidators, auction companies, dealers and brokers. We also compete with them for potential purchasers, as well as with equipment manufacturers, distributors, dealers and equipment rental companies. Some competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources and name recognition. 
 Our business strategy includes the option of partnering with one or more additional purchasers, pursuant to a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company agreement (collectively, “Joint Ventures”). These Joint Ventures give us access to more opportunities, helping to mitigate some of the competition from the market’s larger participants and contribute to our objective to be the leading resource for clients requiring capital asset solutions.
 Government Regulation
 We are subject to federal, state and local consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. Many jurisdictions also regulate “auctions” and “auctioneers” and may regulate online auction services. These consumer protection laws and regulations could result in substantial compliance costs and could interfere with the conduct of our business.
 Legislation in the United States, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, has increased public companies’ regulatory and compliance costs as well as the scope and cost of work provided by independent registered public accountants and legal advisors. The mandatory adoption of XBRL reporting in 2011 has also increased our costs paid to third party service providers. As regulatory and compliance guidelines continue to evolve, we may incur additional costs in the future, which may or may not be material, in order to comply with legislative requirements or rules, pronouncements and guidelines by regulatory bodies.
