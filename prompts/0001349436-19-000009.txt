Item 1.  Business
GENERAL
We are an oil and natural gas company, organized in 2006 as a Delaware corporation, with a principal focus on exploration and production activities in the U.S. Mid-Continent and North Park Basin of Colorado. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had an interest in 1,777 gross (1,095.8 net) producing wells, approximately 1,272 of which we operate, and approximately 777,000 gross (571,000 net) total acres under lease. As of December 31, 2018, we had two rigs drilling in the Mid-Continent and one rig drilling in the North Park Basin. Total estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2018, were 160.2 MMBoe, of which approximately 58% were proved developed.
Our principal executive offices are located at 123 Robert S. Kerr Avenue, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73102 and our telephone number is (405) 429-5500. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are made available free of charge on our website at www.sandridgeenergy.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Any materials that we have filed with the SEC may be accessed via the SEC’s website address at www.sec.gov.
Reorganization Under Chapter 11 and Emergence from Bankruptcy
On May 16, 2016, the Debtors filed Bankruptcy Petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan, and the Debtors’ subsequently emerged from bankruptcy on the Emergence Date. The Company’s Chapter 11 reorganization and related matters are addressed in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Note 1 - Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 Proceedings” and “Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Fresh Start Accounting
Upon emergence from Chapter 11, we elected to apply fresh start accounting effective October 1, 2016, to coincide with the timing of our normal fourth quarter reporting period, which resulted in SandRidge becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. As a result of the application of fresh start accounting and the effects of the implementation of the Plan, the financial statements after October 1, 2016 are not comparable with the financial statements prior to that date. References to the “Successor” or the “Successor Company” relate to SandRidge subsequent to October 1, 2016. References to the “Predecessor” or “Predecessor Company” refer to SandRidge on and prior to October 1, 2016.
Our Mission
SandRidge Energy’s mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to its shareholders by developing, acquiring, and exploring for oil and natural gas resources. The Company’s asset portfolio is positioned to deliver long-term value to shareholders through its inventory of development opportunities in the NW STACK and Mississippian Lime Plays in Oklahoma and the Niobrara in North Park Basin, Colorado. We intend to acquire additional assets in the United States to lower the break-even costs of our investment portfolio and to ensure we deliver competitive and sustainable returns.
Our Business Strategy
SandRidge’s business strategy is to acquire, explore for, and develop hydrocarbon resources in the United States; focus on financial discipline, flexibility, and value creation; and ensure health, safety, and environmental excellence while demonstrating the Company’s core values. We will accomplish this strategy by focusing on the following key objectives:
Attract and retain the best people. Achieving our mission will only be possible through our employees. It is therefore critical to have compensation, development, and human resource programs that attract, retain and motivate the types of people we need to succeed. 
Pursue operational excellence with a sense of urgency. We plan to deliver low cost, consistent and efficient execution of our drilling campaigns, work programs and operations. We will execute our operations in a safe and environmentally
 responsible manner, quickly and efficiently apply advanced technologies, and continuously seek ways to reduce our operating cash costs on a per barrel basis. Operational excellence is the foundation upon which we will achieve our mission.
Invest in high-margin, high rate-of-return projects. The key to achieving our mission will be to prioritize our work programs and allocate our capital to projects that deliver high returns. Additionally, we will assess the full range of uncertainty and thoroughly understand the risks associated with every oil and gas investment so we can accurately and consistently predict our results.
Continuously upgrade our investment portfolio to reduce break-even costs. We will actively pursue accretive acquisitions, mergers and dispositions to improve our margins and returns and to reduce the break-even costs of our portfolio of investment opportunities. This component of our strategy is key to delivering competitive returns to our shareholders on a sustainable basis.
Protect our balance sheet and demonstrate financial discipline. Having the ability to capitalize on opportunities when they arise and investing to generate competitive and sustainable returns requires the financial flexibility that can only be achieved through the financial discipline of balancing our growth plans with the preservation of our balance sheet. To accomplish this we will adhere to the financial principles that lead to the responsible use of leverage,  hedging strategies that are complementary to our use of debt and help ensure the necessary cash flow to sustain our capital programs, and financial strategies that focus on delivering competitive debt-adjusted per share returns.
Acquisitions and Divestitures of Oil and Gas Properties
2018 Divestiture and Acquisition
Divestiture of Permian Basin Properties. On November 1, 2018, we sold substantially all of our oil and natural gas properties, rights and related assets in the CBP region of the Permian Basin, primarily located in Andrews County, TX, along with all of our 13,125,000 common units representing a 25% equity interest in the Permian Trust, to an independent third party for $14.5 million in cash, subject to certain remaining post-closing adjustments, and reduced our asset retirement obligations by approximately $26.9 million. The CBP assets and interest in the Permian Trust include 1,066 producing wells within the Permian Trust's area of mutual interest, certain wells not associated with the Permian Trust, a field office, and all equipment, inventory and yards associated with the Company's CBP operations. As a result of this divestiture, we will no longer have any obligations associated with the Permian Trust. This transaction did not result in a significant alteration of the relationship between our capitalized costs and proved reserves and, accordingly, the divestiture was accounted for as an adjustment to the full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized on the sale.
Acquisition of Oil and Natural Gas Interests. On November 2, 2018, the Company acquired an interest in certain oil and natural gas properties, rights and related assets in the Mississippian Lime and NW STACK areas of Oklahoma and Kansas for approximately $22.5 million in net consideration, net of post-closing adjustments, and assumed asset retirement obligations of approximately $6.4 million. The acquired assets primarily consist of interests in 1,199 producing wells, approximately 80% of which are operated by the Company, an additional 11.1% working interest in approximately 397,000 gross (44,000 net) acres across the Mid-Continent, and an additional 13.2% working interest ownership in the Company's saltwater gathering and disposal system in the Mississippian Lime. This acquisition is expected to increase total production for existing producing properties by approximately 10%.
2017 Acquisition and Divestitures
NW STACK. On February 10, 2017, the Company acquired assets consisting of approximately 13,000 net acres in Woodward County, Oklahoma for approximately $47.8 million in cash, net of post-closing adjustments. Also included in the acquisition were working interests in four wells previously drilled on the acreage.
Oil and Natural Gas Property Divestitures. In 2017, the Company divested various non-core oil and natural gas properties for approximately $17.1 million in cash. All of these divestitures were accounted for as adjustments to the full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized.
2016 Divestiture and Release from Treating Agreement
In January 2016, we transferred ownership of substantially all of our oil and natural gas properties and midstream assets located in the Piñon field in the WTO and $11.0 million in cash to a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental and were released from all past, current and future claims and obligations under an existing 30-year treating agreement with Occidental.
 In connection with this transfer, the Predecessor Company recognized a loss of approximately $89.1 million upon termination of the treating agreement and the cease-use of transportation agreements that supported production from the Piñon field and reduced asset retirement obligations associated with these oil and natural gas properties by $34.1 million. 
PRIMARY BUSINESS OPERATIONS
Our primary operations are the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas. The following table presents information concerning our exploration and production activities by geographic area of operation as of December 31, 2018.

Properties
Mid-Continent
We held interests in approximately 643,000 gross (445,000 net) leasehold acres located primarily in Oklahoma and Kansas at December 31, 2018. Associated proved reserves at December 31, 2018 totaled 110.9 MMBoe, 77.6% of which were proved developed reserves. Our interests in the Mid-Continent as of December 31, 2018 included 1,739 gross (1,057.8 net) producing wells with an average working interest of 61%. We had two rigs operating in the Mid-Continent as of December 31, 2018, which were drilling horizontal wells. One of the rigs was drilling under the drilling participation agreement described below. At December 31, 2018, our Mid-Continent properties included an inventory of 90 operated proved undeveloped laterals. Additionally, we estimate there are several hundred undeveloped probable horizontal well locations. During 2018, we completed a total of 21 horizontal producing wells in this area, which consisted primarily of SRLs.
NW STACK. The Meramec and Osage formations are the primary targets in the STACK play of Blaine and Kingfisher Counties, and are currently being drilled using horizontal well technology in a play area called the NW STACK in Garfield, Major, Dewey, and Woodward Counties. These formations are Mississippian in age, lying above the Woodford Shale formation and below Chester (if present) and Pennsylvanian formations. The Meramec is composed of interbedded shales, sands, and carbonates while the Osage is composed of low porosity, fractured limestone and chert. The top of these target formations ranges in depth from about 5,800 feet at the northern edge of the basin to greater than 14,000 feet toward the interior of the basin. Meramec formation thickness ranges from about 50 feet to over 400 feet and the Osage formation thickness ranges from about 450 to 1,400 feet. The Woodford Shale is the primary hydrocarbon source for both the Meramec and Osage, although the organic content in the Meramec Shale may provide a self-sourcing component as well. Similar to the STACK, there is an over-pressured area and normally pressured area in the NW STACK. Significant industry activity in the NW STACK has established both the Meramec and Osage as productive reservoirs with successful wells. We completed 17 wells in the Meramec formation during 2018 and no Osage wells. Of our total Mid-Continent acreage at December 31, 2018, approximately 116,000 gross (65,000 net) acres are associated with the NW STACK play area. 
In the third quarter of 2017, we entered into a $200.0 million drilling participation agreement with a Counterparty to jointly develop new horizontal wells on a wellbore only basis within certain dedicated sections of our undeveloped leasehold acreage within the Meramec formation in the NW STACK. Under this agreement, the Counterparty is paying 90% of the net drilling and completion costs, up to $100.0 million in the first tranche, in exchange for an initial 80% net working interest in each new well, subject to certain reversionary hurdles. As a result, we are receiving a 20% net working interest after funding 10% of the drilling and completion costs related to the subject wells. We operate all of the wells developed under this agreement
 and retain sole discretion as to the number, location and schedule of wells drilled. The Counterparty also has the option to fund a second $100.0 million tranche, subject to mutual agreement. See "Operational Activities" included in Item 7 of this report for further discussion of the drilling participation agreement.
Mississippian Lime Formation. The Mississippian Lime formation is an expansive carbonate hydrocarbon system located on the Anadarko Shelf in northern Oklahoma and southern Kansas, and is a target for exploration and development within the Mid-Continent. The top of this formation is encountered between approximately 4,000 and 7,000 feet and stratigraphically between various formations of Pennsylvanian age and the Devonian-aged Woodford Shale formation. The Mississippian formation is approximately 350 to 650 feet in gross thickness across our lease position and has targeted porosity zone(s) ranging between 20 and 150 feet in thickness. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 527,000 gross (381,000 net) acres under lease and 1,289 gross (864.8 net) producing wells in the Mississippian formation. We completed two horizontal wells, including one XRL and one SRL, in the Mississippian Lime formation in 2018. 
North Park Basin
Our North Park Basin properties consisted of approximately 123,000 gross (117,000 net) acres, and 38 gross and net producing wells with a working interest of 100%, at December 31, 2018. Associated proved reserves at December 31, 2018 totaled approximately 49.3 MMBoe, of which 12.7% were proved developed reserves. The North Park Basin acreage is located in north central Colorado and, similar to the DJ Basin next to Colorado’s Front Range, has multiple potential pay targets in addition to the Niobrara Shale play where our activity is currently focused. Although untested, zones shallower and deeper than the Niobrara have indications of potentially commercial hydrocarbons. The Niobrara Shale is characterized by stacked pay benches at depths of 5,500 to 9,000 feet with overall reservoir thickness over 450 feet. Based on our delineation drilling on acreage inside and outside federal units, we are developing a proved area where we have 193 proved undeveloped lateral locations. Across our entire acreage position, we estimate there are approximately 1,000 undeveloped probable horizontal lateral locations. We had one rig operating in the North Park Basin which was drilling a horizontal well as of December 31, 2018. We completed a total of eight horizontal producing wells, including seven XRLs and one SRL, in this area during 2018.
Proved Reserves
The portion of a reservoir considered to contain proved reserves includes (i) the portion identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (ii) adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil, natural gas or NGLs on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
Existing economic conditions include prices, costs, operating methods and government regulations existing at the time the reserve estimates are made. SEC prices are used to determine proved reserves, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. See further discussion of prices in “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this report.
Preparation of Reserves Estimates
Over 90% of the proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves disclosed in this report are based on reserve estimates determined and prepared by independent reserve engineers primarily using decline curve analysis to determine the reserves of individual producing wells. A small portion of the proved reserves disclosed in this report were determined by internal reserve engineers. To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, the independent and internal reserve engineers employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations were estimated using volumetric estimates or performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area. These wells were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation and completions using similar techniques. The technologies and economic data used to estimate our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geological maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information and property ownership interests. This data was reviewed by various levels of management for accuracy before consultation with independent reserve engineers. This consultation included review of properties, assumptions and data available. Internal reserve estimates were compared to those prepared by independent reserve engineers to test the estimates and conclusions before the reserves were included in this report. The accuracy of the reserve estimates is dependent on many factors, including the following:
•the quality and quantity of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation of that data;
•estimates regarding the amount and timing of future costs, which could vary considerably from actual costs;
•the accuracy of economic assumptions; and
•the judgment of the personnel preparing the estimates.
SandRidge’s Senior Vice President—Reserves, Technology and Business Development is the technical professional primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering with over 30 years of practical industry experience, including over 30 years of estimating and evaluating reserve information. He has also been a certified professional engineer in the state of Oklahoma since 2007 and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers since 1980.
SandRidge’s reserve engineers monitor well performance and make reserve estimate adjustments as necessary to ensure the most current information is reflected. The information used to prepare reserve estimates includes production histories as well as other geologic, economic, ownership and engineering data. The Corporate Reserves department currently has a total of six full-time employees, comprised of four degreed engineers and two engineering and business analysts with a minimum of a four-year degree in mathematics, finance or other business or science field. 
We encourage ongoing professional education for our engineers and analysts on new technologies and industry advancements as well as refresher training on basic skill sets.
In order to ensure the reliability of reserves estimates, the Corporate Reserves department follows comprehensive SEC-compliant internal controls and policies to determine, estimate and report proved reserves including:
•confirming that we include reserves estimates for all properties owned and that they are based upon proper working and net revenue interests;
•ensuring the information provided by other departments within the Company such as Accounting is accurate; 
•communicating, collaborating, and analyzing with technical personnel in our business units; 
•comparing and reconciling the internally generated reserves estimates to those prepared by third parties;
•utilizing experienced reservoir engineers or those under their direct supervision to prepare reserve estimates; and
•ensuring compensation for the reserve engineers is not tied to the amount of reserves recorded.
Each quarter, the Senior Vice President—Reserves, Technology and Business Development presents the status of the Company’s reserves to senior executives, and subsequently obtains approval of significant changes from key executives. Additionally, the five year PUD development plan is reviewed and approved annually by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and the Senior Vice President - Reserves, Technology and Business Development.
The Corporate Reserves department works closely with independent petroleum consultants at each fiscal year end to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of annual independent reserves estimates. These independently developed reserves estimates are presented to the Audit Committee. In addition to reviewing the independently developed reserve reports, the Audit Committee also periodically meets with the independent petroleum consultants that prepare estimates of proved reserves.
The percentage of total proved reserves prepared by each of the independent petroleum consultants is shown in the table below.

 | December 31, | | | | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016

Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. | — | % | | 3.8 | % | 3.6 | %
Total | 95.1 | % | | 95.4 | % | 94.0 | %

The remaining 4.9%, 4.6% and 6.0% of estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were based on internally prepared estimates, primarily for the Mid-Continent area. 
Copies of the reports issued by our independent reserve consultants with respect to our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves for over 90% of all geographic locations as of December 31, 2018 are filed with this report as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2. The geographic location of our estimated proved reserves prepared by each of the independent reserve consultants as of December 31, 2018 is presented below.

Reporting of Natural Gas Liquids
NGLs are recovered through further processing of a portion of our natural gas production stream. At December 31, 2018, NGLs comprised approximately 18% of total proved reserves on a barrel equivalent basis and represented volumes to be produced from properties where we have contracts in place for the extraction and sale of NGLs. NGLs are products sold by the gallon. In reporting proved reserves and production of NGLs, we have included production and reserves in barrels based on a conversion rate of 42 gallons per barrel. The extraction of NGLs in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale. All production information related to natural gas is reported net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing and extraction of NGLs. 
Reserve Quantities, PV-10 and Standardized Measure 
The following estimates of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves are based on reserve reports as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, over 90% of which were prepared by independent reserve engineers. The reserve reports were based on our drilling schedule at the time year-end reserve estimates were prepared. Our year-end 2018 PUD development plan established that 100% of our current proved undeveloped reserves will be developed within five years from when they were originally recorded. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Item 7 of this report for further discussion of uncertainties inherent to the reserves estimates.

a.Index prices are based on average West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) Cushing spot prices for oil and average Henry Hub spot market prices for natural gas.
b.Average adjusted volume-weighted wellhead product prices reflect adjustments for transportation, quality, gravity, and regional price differentials.
2. Standardized Measure differs from PV-10 as standardized measure includes the effect of future income taxes. At December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the difference between the standardized measure and PV-10 was insignificant due to an excess of tax basis in oil and natural gas properties over projected undiscounted future cash flows from our proved reserves.
3. PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of fair market value of our oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 is used by the industry and by management as a reserve asset value measure to compare against past reserve bases and the reserve bases of other business entities. It is useful because its calculation is not dependent on the taxpaying status of the entity. The following table provides a reconciliation of our Standardized Measure to PV-10:

Proved Reserves - Mid-Continent. Proved reserves in the Mid-Continent, primarily the Mississippian formation, decreased from 130.6 MMBoe at December 31, 2017 to 110.9 MMBoe at December 31, 2018. This reserve reduction is due primarily to downward revisions of 22.5 MMBoe of late life reserves due to (i) an increase in estimated future workover and improved recovery costs that shortened the economic lives of these properties, and (ii) 10.2 MMBoe of negative revisions to prior estimates stemming from changes in well performance, and 2018 production totaling 11.0 MMBoe. Additional reserve decreases amounting to 6.2 MMBoe were the result of wells being shut-in during 2018, changes to lease operating costs and other reserve parameters. Partially offsetting these reductions were the acquisition of 15.4 MMBoe in reserves, 10.3 MMBoe of reserve extensions and discoveries, largely associated with successful drilling in our NW STACK play and a 4.6 MMBoe increase associated with the increase in year-end SEC commodity pricing. 
Proved Reserves - North Park Basin. Our North Park Basin proved reserves in the Niobrara increased from 40.2 MMBoe at December 31, 2017 to 49.3 MMBoe at December 31, 2018. This increase is due to the results of our development drilling program which resulted in 9.0 MMBoe of reserve extensions and discoveries associated with proved undeveloped reserves at an increased well density, 4.5 MMBoe in upward revisions primarily due to converting undeveloped well locations from SRLs to planned XRLs, and a 1.1 MMBoe increase associated with the increase in year-end SEC commodity pricing. These increases were partially offset by downward revisions of 3.7 MMBoe due to an increase in anticipated future lease operating expenses and project schedule changes that lowered estimated ultimate recoveries from these properties, 2018 production of 1.0 MMBoe, and other reductions amounting to 0.8 MMBoe. Our Niobrara proved developed reserves are attributed to 38 horizontal producing wells. Reservoir characteristics of the Niobrara in the North Park Basin are similar to those of the Niobrara in the DJ Basin, consisting of multiple stratigraphic benches. In the North Park Basin, production performance and reservoir data gathered from Niobrara producing wells confirm consistency in reservoir properties such as porosity, thickness and stratigraphic conformity. Using the performance of the proved developed producing wells, proved undeveloped reserves were recorded for 29 sections of the 35 section proved development area at a well density of eight wells per section and 12 wells per section for the remaining six sections. Delineation drilling to determine optimal well spacing is ongoing, although early results indicate the potential for booking more than eight wells per section.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves. The following table summarizes activity associated with proved undeveloped reserves during the periods presented:

 | Year Ended December 31, | | | | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Reserves converted from proved undeveloped to proved developed (MMBoe) | 4.2 | | 1.1 | | 6.8 
Drilling capital expended to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves (in millions) | $ | 63.2 | | $ | 21.0 | $ | 64.5

Total estimated proved undeveloped reserves were 67.9 MMBoe at December 31, 2018, which is an increase of 14.1 MMBoe from the prior year. This increase is primarily due to 18.0 MMBoe from extensions and discoveries which consisted primarily of 8.5 MMBoe in the North Park Basin from increased well density and successful development drilling in the Niobrara shale, and 9.5 MMBoe in the Mid-Continent from horizontal drilling in our NW STACK play. These extensions were offset by 4.2 MMBoe of PUD conversions. 
Total estimated proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2017 were 53.8 MMBoe, an increase of 10.6 MMBoe from the prior year. Reserves added from extensions and discoveries totaled 14.7 MMBoe, which consisted of 10.1 MMBoe in North Park from horizontal wells drilled in the Niobrara Shale, and 4.6 MMBoe in the Mid-Continent from horizontal drilling in our NW STACK play. These extensions were offset by 137 MBoe of proved undeveloped reserves at
 December 31, 2016 that were converted to proved developed reserves during 2017, and net downward revisions of 4.0 MMBoe primarily due to removing PUDs attributable to expiring Mid-Continent undeveloped acreage outside of our NW STACK play that was not scheduled to be developed prior to lease expiry. Approximately 1.0 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves were booked and converted during the year 2017.
Total estimated proved undeveloped reserves were 43.2 MMBoe at December 31, 2016, which is a decrease of 20.9 MMBoe from the prior year, primarily due to downward revisions associated with lower prices that negatively impact economic viability of certain wells and recovery of estimated reserves. Reserves added from extensions and discoveries totaled 5.5 MMBoe, 3.2 MMBoe in the Mid-Continent as a result of horizontal drilling and 2.3 MMBoe in the North Park Basin from horizontal wells drilled in the Niobrara Shale. These extensions were offset by 5.2 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2015 that were converted to proved developed reserves during 2016. Approximately 1.6 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves were booked and converted during the year 2016.

Mississippian Lime Horizontal Field. The Mississippian Lime Horizontal Field is located on the Anadarko Shelf in northern Oklahoma and Kansas and produces from the Mississippian formation. Our interests in the Mississippian Lime Horizontal Field as of December 31, 2018 included 1,289 gross (864.8 net) producing wells and a 67% average working interest in the producing area. 
Niobrara Field. The Niobrara field is located in Colorado and produces from the Niobrara Shale. Currently only oil is marketed while evaluation of midstream options for gas processing and marketing is ongoing. Field testing of gas processing techniques to extract liquids and convert gas to liquids is underway. Our interests in the Niobrara Field as of December 31, 2018, included 38 gross and net producing wells with a 100% average working interest in the producing area.

Productive Wells
The following table presents the number of productive wells in which we owned a working interest at December 31, 2018. We operate substantially all of our wells. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of producing, including oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities and natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries. Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have a working interest and net wells are the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells.

 | Oil | | Natural Gas | | Total | 
 | Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net 
Area | | | | | | 
Mid-Continent | 1,482 | 936.3 | 257 | 121.5 | 1,739 | 1,057.8

Drilling Activity
The following table presents information with respect to wells completed during the periods indicated. This information is not necessarily indicative of future performance, and should not be interpreted to present any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled and quantities or economic value of reserves found. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, regardless of whether they produce a reasonable rate of return. As of December 31, 2018, we had 11 gross (9.3 net) operated wells drilling, completing or awaiting completion.

We had two third-party rigs operating on our Mid-Continent acreage, and one rig operating on our North Park Basin acreage at December 31, 2018. 
Developed and Undeveloped Acreage
The following table presents information regarding our developed and undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2018:

 | Developed Acreage | | Undeveloped Acreage | 
 | Gross | Net | Gross | Net 
Area | | | | 
Mid-Continent | 529,517 | 386,027 | 113,498 | 59,162

Total | 544,612 | 400,065 | 232,507 | 170,672

Many of the leases included in the undeveloped acreage above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms. To prevent expiration, we may exercise our contractual rights to pay delay rentals to extend the terms of leases we value, or establish production from the leasehold acreage prior to expiration, which will keep the lease from expiring until production has ceased. 
As of December 31, 2018, the gross and net acres subject to leases in the undeveloped acreage above are set to expire as follows:

 | Acres Expiring | 
 | Gross | Net 
Twelve Months Ending | | 
December 31, 2019 | 41,900 | 29,938 
December 31, 2020 | 25,744 | 14,143

Total | 232,507 | 170,672

____________________
1.Leases remaining in effect until development efforts or production on the developed portion of the particular lease has ceased.
The acreage due to expire during the twelve months ending December 31, 2019, includes approximately 24,629 gross (15,163 net) acres in the Mid-Continent and 9,949 gross (7,453 net) acres in the North Park Basin. 
Marketing and Customers
We sell our oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety of customers, including utilities, oil and natural gas companies and trading and energy marketing companies. We had three customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue during the 2018 period. See “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information on our major customers. The number of readily available purchasers in the areas where we sell our production makes it unlikely that the loss of a single customer would materially affect our sales. We do not have any material commitments to deliver fixed and determinable quantities of oil and natural gas in the future under existing sales contracts or sales agreements.
Title to Properties
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we conduct a preliminary review of the title to our properties. Prior to commencing drilling operations on our properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects typically at our expense. In addition, prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas assets, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and depending on the materiality of properties, may obtain a drilling title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. To date, we have obtained drilling title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have good and defensible title to our producing properties. Our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens for current taxes and other burdens, which we believe does not materially interfere with the use of, or affect the carrying value of the properties.
COMPETITION
We compete with major oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas companies for leases, equipment, personnel and markets for the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs. We believe our leasehold acreage position, geographic concentration of operations and technical and operational capabilities enable us to compete effectively with other exploration and production operations. However, the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional discussion of competition in the oil and natural gas industry.
Oil, natural gas and NGLs compete with other forms of energy available to customers, including alternate forms of energy such as electricity, coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil, natural gas and NGLs or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs.
SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS
Generally, demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months and demand for oil peaks during the summer months. Certain natural gas purchasers utilize natural gas storage facilities and acquire some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives, delay the installation of production facilities, and increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during certain times of the year, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
General
Our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, tribal, regional and local laws and regulations governing worker safety and health, the discharge and disposal of substances into the environment, and the protection of the environment and natural resources. Numerous governmental entities, including the EPA and analogous state and local agencies, (and, under certain laws, private individuals) have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and any permits issued under them. These laws and regulations may, among other things: (i) require permits to conduct exploration, drilling, water withdrawal, wastewater disposal and other production related activities; (ii) govern the types, quantities and concentrations of substances that may be disposed or released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with drilling or production activities, and the manner of any such disposal, release, or injection; (iii) limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities or require formal mitigation measures in sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; (iv) require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions arising from the Company’s operations or attributable to former operations; (v) impose safety and health restrictions designed to protect employees from exposure to hazardous or dangerous substances; and (vi) impose obligations to reclaim and abandon well sites and pits. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining operations in affected areas. 
The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in or more stringent enforcement of these laws and regulations that result in delays or restrictions in permitting or development of projects or more stringent or costly construction, drilling, water management or completion activities or waste handling, storage, transport, remediation, or disposal emission or discharge requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company. We may be unable to pass on increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases, including spills, may occur in the course of our operations, and there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property and natural resources or personal injury. While we do not believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will have an adverse material effect on us, we can provide no assurance that we will not incur substantial costs in the future related to revised or additional environmental regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing and proposed environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on the Company.
Hazardous Substances and Wastes
We currently own, lease, or operate, and in the past have owned, leased, or operated, properties that have been used in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. We believe we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the applicable time, but hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, and wastes may have been disposed or released on, from or under the properties owned, leased, or operated by us or on or under other locations where these substances and wastes have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose storage treatment and disposal or release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, and wastes were not under our control. These properties and the substances or wastes disposed or released on them may be subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”), the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, (“RCRA”), and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously
 disposed substances or wastes (including substances or wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to investigate and clean up contaminated property, to perform remedial actions to prevent future contamination, or to pay some or all of the costs of any such action.
CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws may impose strict, joint and several liability without regard to fault or legality of conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release of a hazardous substance occurred as well as entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, these “responsible persons” may be liable for the costs of cleaning up sites where the hazardous substances have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources resulting from the release and for the costs of certain environmental and health studies. Additionally, landowners and other third parties may file claims for personal injury and natural resource and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances into the environment. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment from a hazardous substance release and to pursue steps to recover costs incurred for those actions from responsible parties. Despite the so-called “petroleum exclusion,” certain products used in the course of our operations may be regulated as CERCLA hazardous substances. To date, no Company-owned or operated site has been designated as a Superfund site, and we have not been identified as a responsible party for any Superfund site.
We also generate wastes that are subject to the requirements of RCRA and comparable state statutes. RCRA imposes strict “cradle-to-grave” requirements on the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, production and/or development of oil and natural gas, including naturally-occurring radioactive material, if properly handled, are currently excluded from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements. However, it is possible that these wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and natural gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary, and complete any revisions to the applicable RCRA regulations no later than July 15, 2021. Any change in the exclusion for such wastes could potentially result in an increase in costs to manage and dispose of wastes which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, in the course of our operations, we generate petroleum hydrocarbon wastes and ordinary industrial wastes that are subject to regulation under the RCRA if they have hazardous characteristics.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act (the “CAA”), as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants through emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The need to acquire such permits has the potential to delay or limit the development of our oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues. For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare. The EPA was required to make attainment and non-attainment designations for specific geographic locations under the revised standards by October 1, 2017, but missed the deadline. Subsequently, in November 2017, the EPA published a list of areas that are in compliance with the new ozone standards and separately in December 2017 issued responses to state recommendation for designating non-attainment areas. States then had the opportunity to submit new air quality monitoring to the EPA prior to the EPA finalizing any non-attainment designations. While the EPA has determined that all counties in which we operate are in attainment with the new ozone standard, these determinations may be revised in the future. With the EPA lowering the ground-level ozone standard, certain states may be required to implement more stringent regulations, which could apply to our operations and result in the need to install new emissions controls, longer permitting timelines and significant increases in our capital or operating expenditures. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements. Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the
 potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could be significant.
Water Discharges
The federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (the “CWA”), and analogous state laws and implementing regulations, impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited unless it is permitted by the EPA, the Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps") or an analogous state or tribal agency. We do not presently discharge pollutants associated with the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas into federal or state waters. The CWA and analogous state laws and regulations also impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of sediment via storm water run-off from a wide variety of construction activities. Such activities are generally prohibited from discharging sediment unless permitted by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The EPA issued a final rule in September 2015 that attempts to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States. The EPA and the Corps then proposed a rulemaking in June 2017 to repeal the June 2015 rule and also announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the CWA’s jurisdiction. The EPA and the Corps issued a final rule in January 2018 staying implementation of the 2015 rule for two years. Subsequently, on December 11, 2018, the EPA and the Corps proposed a new rule defining the CWA’s jurisdiction. A nationwide patchwork of litigation and court rulings developed regarding the rules. At this time, due to varied court rulings, the 2015 rule is effective in some states, while the agencies’ decision to delay implementation of the 2015 rule is effective in other states. If finalized, the 2018 proposed rule would apply nationwide, replacing the national patchwork of CWA jurisdictional applicability. Additionally, if finalized, it is possible that the 2018 proposed rule will be challenged. The scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction likely will remain fluid until a final regulatory determination is made and subsequent litigation, if any, is completed. To the extent a rule ultimately promulgated expands the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas in connection with any expansion activities. Also, in June 2016, the EPA issued a final rule implementing wastewater pretreatment standards that prohibit onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities from sending wastewater to publicly-owned treatment works. This restriction of disposal options for hydraulic fracturing waste and other changes to CWA requirements may result in increased costs.
Finally, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), which amends the CWA, establishes standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills into waters of the United States. The OPA requires measures to be taken to prevent the accidental discharge of oil into waters of the United States from onshore production facilities. Measures under the OPA and/or the CWA include inspection and maintenance programs to minimize spills from oil storage and conveyance systems; the use of secondary containment systems to prevent spills from reaching nearby water bodies; proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill; and the development and implementation of spill prevention, control and countermeasure (“SPCC”) plans to prevent and respond to oil spills. The OPA also subjects owners and operators of facilities to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a spill. We have developed and implemented SPCC plans for properties as required under the CWA. 
Subsurface Injections
Underground injection operations performed by us are subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), as well as analogous state laws and regulations. Under the SDWA, the EPA established the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program, which established the minimum program requirements for state and local programs regulating underground injection activities. The UIC program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. State regulations require a permit from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate underground injection wells. Although the Company monitors the injection process of its wells, any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of our UIC permit, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third-parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages and personal injuries. Some states have considered laws mandating flowback and produced water recycling. Other states have undertaken studies to assess the feasibility of recycling produced water on a large scale. For example, in July 2018, the EPA partnered with New Mexico to assess alternatives to the immediate disposal of wastewater from exploration and production activities by reusing it or treating it for reintroduction into the hydrologic cycle or both, and to propose potential regulations related thereto. If such laws are adopted in areas where we conduct operations, our operating costs may increase significantly.
Furthermore, in response to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of produced water resulting from oil and natural gas activities, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have restricted, suspended or shut down the use of such disposal wells. For example, in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (“OCC”) has implemented a variety of measures including adopting the National Academy of Science’s “traffic light system,” pursuant to which the agency reviews new disposal well applications for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or not permitted. The OCC also evaluates existing wells to assess their continued operation, or operation with restrictions, based on location relative to such faults, seismicity and other factors, with certain of such existing wells required to make frequent, or even daily, volume and pressure reports. In addition, the OCC has issued rules requiring operators of certain saltwater disposal wells in the state to, among other things, conduct mechanical integrity testing or make certain demonstrations of such wells’ depth that, depending on the depth, could require the plugging back of such wells and/or the reduction of volumes disposed in such wells. As a result of these measures, the OCC from time to time has developed and implemented plans calling for wells within areas of interest where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations in an attempt to mitigate the occurrence of such incidents. For example, in February 2016, the OCC issued a plan to reduce disposal well volume in the Arbuckle formation by 40 percent, covering approximately 5,281 square miles and 245 disposal wells injecting wastewater into the Arbuckle formation. In the plan, the OCC identified 76 SandRidge-operated disposals wells, prescribed a four stage volume reduction schedule and set April 30, 2016 as the final date for compliance with the tiered volume reduction plan. In March 2016, the OCC reduced the injection volume of additional Arbuckle disposal wells, including wells we operate. Following earthquakes in August, September and November 2016, the OCC and the EPA further limited the disposal volumes that can be disposed in Arbuckle wells, although these actions did not cover our disposal wells. While induced seismic events generally decreased in 2017, the OCC expanded restrictions on the use of existing Arbuckle disposal wells and imposed new reporting requirements related to disposal volumes on wells injecting produced water into the Arbuckle formation. In February 2018, the OCC instituted a new protocol to further address seismicity in the Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher County and South Central Oklahoma Oil Province Plays which requires various actions, such as a pause in operations for several hours, when certain seismic data is observed. Such requirements may reduce the productivity of our operations in relevant areas. 
Additionally, the Governor of Kansas has established a task force composed of various administrative agencies to study and develop an action plan for addressing seismic activity in the state. The task force issued a recommended Seismic Action Plan calling for enhanced seismic monitoring and the development of a seismic response plan, and in November 2014, the Governor of Kansas announced a plan to enhance seismic monitoring in the state. In March 2015, the Kansas Corporation Commission issued its Order Reducing Saltwater Injection Rates (the "Order"). The Order identified five areas of heightened seismic concern within Harper and Sumner Counties and mandated that, within 100 days of the Order’s issuance, operators must limit saltwater injection volumes to no more than 8,000 barrels per day for any well located in one of these five areas. SandRidge and other operators of injection wells were required to reduce the injection volume, and any injection well drilled deeper than the Arbuckle Formation was required to be plugged back to a shallower formation in a manner approved by the Kansas Corporation Commission. In August 2016, the Kansas Corporation Commission issued an order that put a 16,000 barrels per day limit on additional Arbuckle disposal wells not previously identified in the Order. While no additional regulatory actions were taken in Kansas with respect to induced seismicity concerns in 2017 or 2018, permit applications for new saltwater disposal well facilities have faced increased local opposition.
Evaluation of seismic incidents and whether or to what extent those events are induced by the injection of saltwater into disposal wells continues to evolve, as governmental authorities consider new and/or past seismic incidents in areas where salt water disposal activities occur or are proposed to be performed. The adoption of any new laws, regulations, or directives that restrict our ability to dispose of saltwater generated by production and development activities , whether by plugging back the depths of disposal wells, reducing the volume of salt water disposed in such wells, restricting disposal well locations or otherwise, or by requiring us to shut down disposal wells, could significantly increase our costs to manage and dispose of this saltwater, which could negatively affect the economic lives of the affected properties. In addition, we could find ourselves subject to third party lawsuits alleging damages resulting from seismic events that occur in our areas of operation.
Climate Change
The EPA previously has published its findings that emissions of CO2, methane and certain other “greenhouse gases” ("GHGs") present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on its findings, the EPA has adopted and implemented regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emission. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that typically are established by the states. This rule could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay its ability to obtain air
 permits for new or modified facilities that exceed GHG emission thresholds. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from oil and natural gas production and processing facilities on an annual basis, as well as reporting GHG emissions from gathering and boosting systems, oil well completions and workovers using hydraulic fracturing. More recently, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules to reduce methane emissions from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas sector, including implementation of a leak detection and repair (“LDAR”) program to minimize methane emissions, under the CAA’s New Source Performance Standards, Subpart OOOOa (“Quad Oa”). In June 2017, the EPA proposed a two-year stay of the rules and in October 2018 the EPA proposed revisions to Quad Oa, such as changes to the frequency for monitoring fugitive emissions at well sites and changes to requirements that a professional engineer certify when meeting certain Quad Oa requirements is technically infeasible. Regardless of the stay and potential regulatory revisions, it is possible that these rules will continue to require oil and gas operators to expend material sums. In addition, in November 2016, the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued final rules to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas operations on public lands that are substantially similar to the EPA Quad Oa requirements. However, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule to temporarily suspend or delay certain requirements contained in the November 2016 final rule until January 17, 2019, including those requirements relating to venting, flaring and leakage from oil and gas production activities. Further, in September 2018, the BLM published a final rule revising or rescinding certain provisions of the 2016 rule. As a result of these developments, future implementation of the EPA and the BLM methane rules remains uncertain, but given the long-term trend towards increasing regulation, future federal GHG regulations for the oil and gas industry remain a possibility. Moreover, several states where we operate, including Colorado, have already adopted rules requiring operators of both new and existing sources to develop and implement a LDAR program and to install devices on certain equipment to capture 95 percent of methane emissions. Compliance with these rules could require us to purchase pollution control equipment and optical gas imaging equipment for LDAR inspections, and to hire additional personnel to assist with inspection and reporting requirements.
In addition, a number of state and regional efforts are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. On an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that agreed in December 2015 to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measure each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets, (the “Paris Agreement”). However, the Paris Agreement does not impose any binding obligations on the United States. Moreover, in June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but may enter into a future international agreement related to GHGs. In August 2017, the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Such withdrawal has not yet been finalized, and whether the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement is unclear at this time. Further, several states and local governments remain committed to the principles of the Paris Agreement in their effectuation of policy and regulations. It is not possible at this time to predict how or when the United States might impose restrictions on GHGs as a result of the Paris Agreement. The adoption and implementation of any laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHG from, our equipment and operations could require additional expenditures to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with its operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce, and thus possibly have a material adverse effect on our revenues, as well as having the potential effect of lowering the value of our reserves. Recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. Finally, to the extent increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events, such events could have a material adverse effect on the Company and potentially subject the Company to further regulation.
Endangered or Threatened Species
The federal Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats without first obtaining an incidental take permit and implementing mitigation measures. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. While compliance with the ESA has not had an adverse effect on our exploration, development and production operations in areas where threatened or endangered species or their habitat are known to exist, it may require us to incur increased costs to implement mitigation or protective measures and also may delay, restrict or preclude drilling activities in those areas or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons. In addition, certain of our federal and state leases may contain stipulations that require us to take measures to safeguard certain species, including the sage grouse, and their habitats known to be located within the area of the lease. Although the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) declined to list the sage grouse under the ESA in 2015 and subsequently developed a conservation plan to protect existing habit, some environmental groups have continued to raise concerns about sufficient
 protections for the sage grouse population. Under the plan, the USFWS committed to review the status of the species every five years to evaluate conservation actions, with the plan to be next reviewed and revised if necessary in 2020. In addition, the U.S. Department of Interior (“DOI”) proposed in December 2018 revisions to the existing sage grouse conservation plan that, amongst other things, was intended to give the DOI and individual states flexibility to allow for increased activity in grouse habitat management areas encompassing parts of Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Northern California, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. Several environmental groups have announced opposition to DOI’s proposed revisions to sage grouse conservation plan, and it is possible that these groups could pursue new litigation in the future to reconsider listing the sage grouse under the ESA. If endangered or otherwise protected species are located in areas where we wish to conduct seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations, the work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. For example, certain of our operations in Colorado are in proximity to sage grouse habitat and we are prohibited from performing operations in those areas during certain hours from March to mid-July of each year. Further, in February 2016, the USFWS published a final policy which alters how it identifies critical habitats for endangered and threatened species. In July 2018, the USFWS proposed several changes to ESA regulations, including changes to the procedures and criteria for listing or removing species from the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants and for designating critical habitat. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Moreover, a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2011 required the USFWS to consider listing numerous species as endangered under the ESA by the end of its 2017 fiscal year; however, the agency has not yet completed this process. 
The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves. 
We are an active participant on various agency and industry committees that are developing or addressing various USFWS and other federal and state agency programs to minimize potential impacts to business activity relating to the protection of any endangered or threatened species.
Employee Health and Safety
Our operations are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires us to maintain information concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and to provide this information to employees. Pursuant to the Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, facilities that store threshold amounts of chemicals that are subject to OSHA’s Hazard Communication Standard above certain threshold quantities must submit information regarding those chemicals by March 1 of each year to state and local authorities in order to facilitate emergency planning and response. That information is generally available to employees, state and local governmental authorities, and the public. We do not believe that compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety will have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
State Regulation
The states in which we operate, along with some municipalities and Native American tribal areas, regulate some or all of the following activities: the drilling for, and the production and gathering of, oil and natural gas, including requirements relating to drilling permits, the location, spacing and density of wells, unitization and pooling of interests, the method of drilling, casing and equipping of wells, the protection of fresh water sources, the orderly development of common sources of supply of oil and natural gas, the operation of wells, allowable rates of production, the use of fresh water in oil and natural gas operations, saltwater injection and disposal operations, the plugging and abandonment of wells and the restoration of surface properties, the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources, the protection of the correlative rights of oil and natural gas owners and, where necessary to avoid unfair, unjust or discriminatory service, the fees, terms and conditions for the gathering of natural gas. These regulations may affect the number and location of our wells and the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells, and increase the costs of our operations. Moreover, obtaining or renewing permits and other approvals for operating on Native American lands can take substantial amounts of time, and could result in increased costs or delays to our operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is a practice in the oil and natural gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from low permeability subsurface rock formations. Oil and natural gas may be recovered from certain of our oil and natural
 gas properties through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with sophisticated drilling. Hydraulic fracturing, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, several federal agencies have asserted federal regulatory authority over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, the EPA published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the use of diesel fuel in fracturing operations; issued CAA final regulations in 2012 and additional CAA regulations in June 2016 governing performance standards for the oil and natural gas industry; and in June 2016 issued final effluent limitations guidelines under the CWA that waste water from shale natural gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a publicly-owned treatment plant. The EPA also issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) in 2014 regarding reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing but, to date, has taken no further action. Separately, the BLM published a final rule in March 2015 that establishes new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. However, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming struck down this rule in June 2016. The June 2016 decision was appealed by the BLM to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. However, following issuance of a presidential executive order to review rules related to the energy industry, in July 2017, the BLM published a proposed rule to rescind the 2015 final rule. In September 2017, the Tenth Circuit issued a ruling to vacate the Wyoming trial court decision and dismiss the lawsuit challenging the 2015 rule in light of the BLM’s proposed rulemaking. The BLM issued a final rule repealing the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule in December 2017.
Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process but, at this time, federal legislation related to hydraulic fracturing appears unlikely. At the state level, some states, including Oklahoma and Colorado, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, operational or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, or that prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether. Local government may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted at the local, state or federal level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction requirements, increased reporting or plugging and abandoning requirements or operational restrictions, and associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs. These delays or additional costs could adversely affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable, and could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities.
In addition to asserting regulatory authority, certain government agencies have conducted reviews focusing on environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in December 2016. The EPA report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water sources “under some circumstances,” noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. Since the report did not find a direct link between hydraulic fracturing itself and contamination of groundwater resources, this years-long study report does not appear to provide any basis for further regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal level.
We diligently review best practices and industry standards, serve on industry association committees and comply with all regulatory requirements in the protection of potable water sources. Protective practices include, but are not limited to, setting multiple strings of protection pipe across the potable water sources and cementing these pipes from setting depth to surface, continuously monitoring the hydraulic fracturing process in real time and disposing of all non-commercially produced fluids in certified disposal wells at depths below the potable water sources. There have not been any incidents, citations or suits related to our hydraulic fracturing activities involving environmental concerns.
OTHER REGULATION OF THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY
The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state, local, and regional authorities, as well as Native American tribes. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, and Native American tribes are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for noncompliance. Although the regulatory burden on the oil
 and natural gas industry increases the Company’s cost of doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability, these burdens generally do not affect the Company any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.
The price of oil, natural gas and NGLs is not currently regulated and are made at market prices. Although oil, natural gas and NGL prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil, natural gas and NGL prices might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations.
Drilling and Production
Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at federal, state, local and Native American tribal levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties, municipalities and Native American tribal areas where we operate also regulate one or more of the following activities:
•the location of wells;
•the method of drilling and casing wells;
•the timing of construction or drilling activities;
•the rates of production, or “allowables”;
•the use of surface or subsurface waters;
•the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;
•the plugging and abandoning of wells; and
•the notice to surface owners and other third parties.
State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas, and NGLs within its jurisdiction.
 State agencies in Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas impose financial assurance requirements on operators. The Corps and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment, decommissioning and site restoration.
Natural Gas Sales and Transportation
The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. The FERC’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas.
Historically, federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production. FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the “NGA”) and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Various federal laws enacted since 1978 have resulted in the removal of all price and non-price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in first sales, which include all of our sales of our own production. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct 2005”), FERC has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties of up to $1,238,271 per day for each
 violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our systems have not been regulated by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA, we are required to report aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. In addition, Congress may enact legislation or FERC may adopt regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to further regulation. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) also holds authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities market including oil and natural gas. With regard to physical purchases and sales of natural gas and other energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are thus required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC and/or the CFTC. The CFTC also holds substantial enforcement authority, including the ability to assess civil penalties of up to $1,116,156 per day per violation.
FERC also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity. Commencing in 1985, FERC promulgated a series of orders, regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas. Currently, interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers, marketers and other shippers, regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company. FERC’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive, open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third-party sellers other than pipelines. However, the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by FERC and Congress might not continue indefinitely into the future. The Company is unable to determine what effect, if any, future regulatory changes might have on the Company’s natural gas related activities.
Under FERC’s current regulatory regime, transmission services must be provided on an open-access, nondiscriminatory basis at cost-based rates or at market-based rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive. Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in-state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, in the past FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our cost of transporting gas to point-of-sale locations.
Oil Price Controls and Transportation Rates 
Sales prices of oil and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. Our sales of these commodities are, however, subject to laws and to regulations issued by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) prohibiting manipulative or fraudulent conduct in the wholesale petroleum market. The FTC holds substantial enforcement authority under these regulations, including the ability to assess civil penalties of up to $1,156,953 per day per violation. Our sales of these commodities, and any related hedging activities, are also subject to CFTC oversight as discussed above.
The price we receive from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. Some of our transportation of oil, natural gas and NGLs is through interstate common carrier pipelines. Effective as of January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. The FERC’s regulation of crude oil and natural gas liquids transportation rates may tend to increase the cost of transporting crude oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipelines, although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year. Every five years, the FERC must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry. We are not able at this time to predict the effects of these regulations or FERC proceedings, if any, on the transportation costs associated with crude oil production from our crude oil producing operations.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 310 full-time employees, including 48 geologists, geophysicists, petroleum engineers, technicians, land and regulatory professionals. Of our 310 employees, 163 were located at the Company’s headquarters in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma at December 31, 2018, and the remaining employees worked in our various field offices and drilling sites.
