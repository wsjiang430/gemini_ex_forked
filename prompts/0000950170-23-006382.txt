 Item 1. Business
 General
 Pactiv Evergreen is a leading manufacturer and distributor of fresh foodservice and food merchandising products and fresh beverage cartons in North America. We produce a broad range of products that protect, package and display fresh food and beverages for consumers who want to eat or drink fresh, prepared or ready-to-eat food and beverages conveniently and with confidence. We supply our products to a broad and diversified mix of companies, including full service restaurants (also referred to as FSRs), quick service restaurants (also referred to as QSRs), foodservice distributors, supermarkets, grocery and healthy eating retailers, other food stores, food and beverage producers and food processors. We operate primarily in North America.
Segment Overview
 We manufacture and sell products through the following three reportable segments:
 •Foodservice. Our Foodservice segment manufactures a broad range of products that enable consumers to eat and drink where they want and when they want with convenience, including food containers, drinkware (such as hot and cold cups and lids), tableware, serviceware and other products that make eating on-the-go more enjoyable and easy to do. Foodservice’s customer base includes chain restaurants, FSRs, established and emerging QSRs, distributors, institutional foodservice (such as airports, schools and hospitals) and convenience stores. Our Fabri-Kal acquisition was fully integrated into this segment during 2022.
 •Food Merchandising. Our Food Merchandising segment manufactures products that protect and attractively display food while preserving freshness, including clear rigid-display containers, containers for prepared and ready-to-eat food, trays for meat and poultry and molded fiber egg cartons. Food Merchandising’s customers include supermarkets, grocery and healthy eating retailers and other food stores as well as meat, egg, agricultural and consumer packaged goods processors.
 •Beverage Merchandising. Our Beverage Merchandising segment manufactures cartons for fresh refrigerated beverage products, primarily producing integrated fresh carton systems, which include printed cartons, spouts and filling machines, for dairy (including plant-based, organic and specialty dairy), juice and other specialty beverage end-markets. Beverage Merchandising also produces fiber-based liquid packaging board for sale to other fresh beverage carton manufacturers, as well as a range of paper-based products that it sells to paper and packaging converters.

Strategic Initiatives
 Our strategic initiatives are grouped into five key areas: profitable growth; operational excellence; innovation and digital transformation; social responsibility; and people.
 •Profitable growth: Drive growth of our products, deploy capital efficiently and improve our financial position through debt reduction, increasing working capital efficiency and maintaining strong operating results.
 •Operational excellence: Deliver consistently and reliably with lower risks and operating costs than our competition, while maintaining our commitment to quality, service and safety.
 •Innovation and digital transformation: Proactively implement new ways to service our customers with new and on-trend products and optimize our processes through automation and streamlining of our manufacturing and supply chain footprint.
 •Social responsibility: Maintain and grow the broadest sustainable product offering in the industry and operate in a safe and sustainable manner that limits our impact on the environment.
 •People: Attract, retain and develop the right talent to drive our business forward.
 We rigorously track and measure the progress and results of our initiatives. We are focused on long-term planning and goal-setting strategies as well as our near-term operating results. We believe our strategic initiatives help drive our revenue growth, increase our market share and improve our margins.
 Where appropriate, we also seek to grow our business with targeted acquisitions that enable us to achieve our strategic goals. For example, in October 2021, we completed the acquisition of Fabri-Kal, a manufacturer of thermoformed plastic packaging products

whose products include food containers and drinkware (cold cups and lids) for the institutional foodservice and consumer packaged goods markets. The acquisition includes four manufacturing facilities in the United States. For additional details, refer to Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the consolidated financial statements.
 Over the last several years, our business has evolved to focus on our core, business-to-business North American foodservice, food merchandising and beverage merchandising operations. Before and after our IPO in September 2020, we divested certain of our non-core businesses, and may do so in the future. For example, in October 2021, we agreed to sell our interest in Naturepak Beverage Packaging Co. Ltd., our 50% joint venture with Naturepak Limited, which is a leading provider of fresh liquid carton and packaging systems in the Middle East and North Africa region, and in January 2022, we agreed to sell our carton packaging and filling machinery businesses in China, Korea and Taiwan. In addition, we divested our remaining closures businesses during the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. For information on divestitures undertaken before our IPO, please refer to the “Corporate Information” section below. For details on divestitures and distributions of certain operations that impacted our results, refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, and Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the consolidated financial statements.
 During the first quarter of 2023, we announced a plan to take significant restructuring actions related to our Beverage Merchandising operations. We expect these actions, which we refer to as the Beverage Merchandising Restructuring, to increase our production efficiency, streamline our management structure and reduce our ongoing capital expenditures and overhead costs. For additional information related to this restructuring program, refer to Note 22, Subsequent Events, to the consolidated financial statements and to Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability – Beverage Merchandising Restructuring within Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 Customers
 We supply our products to a broad and diversified mix of companies, including FSRs, QSRs, foodservice distributors, supermarkets, grocery and healthy eating retailers, other food stores, food and beverage producers, food packers and food processors. Our customers range from large blue-chip multinational companies to national and regional companies to small local businesses. We have developed strong and longstanding relationships with our customers, including many leading restaurants and brands. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in 2022. Our ten largest customers accounted for 40% of net revenues in 2022.
Seasonality
 Our business does not experience high seasonality due to the complementary nature of the seasonal effects on our segments, though portions of our business are moderately seasonal. Our Foodservice and Food Merchandising operations peak during the summer and fall months in North America when the favorable weather and harvest and holiday seasons lead to increased consumption, resulting in greater levels of sales in the second and third quarters. Beverage Merchandising’s customers are principally engaged in providing products that are generally less sensitive to seasonal effects, although Beverage Merchandising does experience some seasonality as a result of increased consumption of milk by school children during the North American academic year, resulting in a greater level of carton product sales in the first and fourth quarters. The negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic on our business during 2020 and 2021 outweighed the impacts of seasonality during those years. Refer to Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability – COVID-19 within Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for additional details.
Competition
 The markets in which we sell our products historically have been, and continue to be, highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, sustainability and price. While we have long-term relationships with many of our customers, the underlying contracts may be re-bid or renegotiated from time to time, and we may not be successful in renewing on favorable terms or at all, as pricing and other competitive pressures may occasionally result in the loss of a customer relationship. Our competitors include, among others, Dart Container Corporation, Huhtamäki Oyj, Berry Global Group, Inc., Genpak, Sonoco, Paper Excellence Group, Stora Enso Oyj, Tekni-Plex, Sealed Air Corporation, Silgan Holdings, SIG Combibloc, Tetra Pak and Elopak.
Distribution and Marketing
 We have a large, well-invested manufacturing base and a hub-and-spoke distribution network in the United States and in the international geographies in which we operate. Most of our assets are in the United States, which allows us to provide an extensive offering of U.S.-manufactured products to our customers. We believe our manufacturing footprint and distribution network provide us a competitive advantage in each of our segments. Foodservice is the only manufacturer among its competitors in the United States with an extensive nationwide hub-and-spoke distribution network, enabling customers to buy across our entire product offering. Food Merchandising is a low cost U.S. manufacturer with well-invested facilities within close proximity to our customer base. We have an unrivalled product offering in the North American foodservice and food merchandising markets and a “one-face-to-the-customer” service model. This service model uses one sales representative per account to produce one order with multiple SKUs supported by one customer service representative who is responsible for one shipment with one invoice. We believe Beverage Merchandising is uniquely positioned in the United States as the only producer that manufactures fresh beverage cartons, filling machinery and liquid packaging board, which we believe positions us as a low cost solution with excellent customer service.


We have made manufacturing flexibility a priority in our investment of capital. We are able to offer substrates and product lines to match changing market needs efficiently and at low cost. This enables us to scale production in response to the requirements of our customers and trends in the market, including for example, increasing our use of recycled and recyclable material to produce a greater number of sustainable products and earn higher margins from the sale of these products. We have strategically invested in flexible manufacturing assets that can be quickly converted to produce alternative products. Our broad manufacturing base includes approximately 1,100 production lines.
 As of December 31, 2022, Foodservice has 22 manufacturing plants, and Food Merchandising has 24 manufacturing plants. Foodservice and Food Merchandising share the use of 33 warehouses and 8 regional mixing centers. Beverage Merchandising has 6 U.S. beverage carton manufacturing plants, 1 international beverage carton manufacturing plant, 1 filling machinery plant, 3 extrusion plants, 2 integrated liquid packaging board mills and 3 chip mills. Each of our manufacturing plants is managed by a manufacturing director, and we use lean operating practices and information systems to measure performance against objective metrics to optimize manufacturing efficiency and reduce cost.
 Raw Materials
 The primary raw materials used to manufacture our products are plastic resins, fiber (principally raw wood, wood chips and recycled newsprint) and paperboard (principally cartonboard and cupstock). We also use commodity chemicals, steel and energy, including fuel oil, electricity, natural gas and coal, to manufacture our products. We purchase most of our raw materials based on negotiated rates with suppliers, which are tied to published indices. Typically, we do not enter into long-term purchase contracts that provide for fixed quantities or prices for our principal raw materials. Most of our raw materials and other input costs are purchased on the spot market.
 Resin prices have historically fluctuated based on changes in supply and demand and influenced by the prices of crude oil and monomers, which may be impacted by extreme weather conditions and the demand for other end uses. The prices of raw wood and wood chips may fluctuate due to external conditions such as weather, product scarcity, commodity market fluctuations and changes in governmental policies and regulations. Tariffs, trade sanctions and other disruptions in international commerce can also affect the cost of our raw materials.
 We mitigate the impact of increased commodity costs principally through higher product pricing, manufacturing and overhead cost control and hedging arrangements. Many of the customer pricing agreements that our segments enter into contain raw material cost pass-through mechanisms that adjust prices to reflect the impact of changes in raw material costs. Generally, the contractual price adjustments do not occur simultaneously with commodity price fluctuations, but rather on a mutually agreed upon schedule, which often causes a lead-lag effect, during which margins are negatively impacted in the short term when raw material costs increase and positively impacted in the short term when raw material costs decrease. Historically, the average lag time in implementing raw material cost pass-through mechanisms has been between three and four months. From time to time, we may also use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials, but we do not fully hedge against commodity cost changes, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs.
 At this time, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources.
 For additional information on our commodity costs, refer to Financial Outlook – Raw Materials and Energy Prices within Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 Intellectual Property and Research and Development
 We have a proven history of product innovation, including the introduction of new products and the addition of innovative features to existing products. Innovation is a core capability we are proud of and a key focus area going forward as we strive to enhance our product portfolio, drive growth and increase margins.
 We have significant intellectual property and proprietary know-how. As of December 31, 2022, we held over 300 patents related to product design, utility and material formulations.
 Our primary focus areas for product innovation are developing packaging with useful new features, engineering new materials that improve the performance of our products and commercializing new environmentally-friendly packaging. Both consumer preferences and customer requirements continually evolve, and we strive to develop useful new features and products to meet those needs. Through our longstanding customer relationships, we gain valuable insight into our customers’ needs and are able to identify, engineer and develop optimal products for them. Functionality, quality, material savings, brand marketing, sustainability and safety are key drivers in our product development. Examples of our product innovations include reclosable beverage cartons, strawless lids, compostable cutlery and recycled polyethylene terephthalate “PET” containers.
 In Foodservice, our product innovation initiatives are focused on developing new products made from sustainable materials. In Food Merchandising, our product innovation is focused on rapidly growing emerging companies for whom packaging helps deliver their brand. In Beverage Merchandising, we have developed a variety of carton designs to help beverage manufacturers differentiate their

products and generate stronger brand recognition. Our barrier board technology allows our customers to achieve longer shelf life for their products while protecting against the loss of vitamins and other nutrients.
 In 2022, 2021 and 2020, we spent a total of $33 million, $22 million and $20 million, respectively, on research and development efforts. We have dedicated technology and innovation facilities, and we employ personnel focused on product development, material innovation and process improvement. Our material science expertise and state-of-the-art product design and testing capabilities enable us to engineer high-performing materials and create new and innovative products to meet the requirements of our customers and the preferences of consumers as well as to increase food safety. We use our material science expertise to focus on sustainability, performance and material savings. We have industry-leading innovation centers where, among other things, we develop innovative resin blending and compounding formulations and processes and new engineered materials using paper/fiber substrates, which have on-site design, testing, prototyping and production capabilities. These unique material and product design capabilities allow us to partner with our customers to rapidly develop and commercialize new and innovative solutions that further increase the value we provide our customers.
 Regulation
 Our business is subject to regulations governing products that may contact food in all the countries in which we have operations. Future regulatory and legislative changes can affect the economics of our business activities, lead to changes in operating practices, affect our customers and influence the demand for and the cost of providing products and services to our customers. We have implemented compliance programs and procedures designed to achieve compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and believe these programs and procedures are generally effective. Our production facilities are independently audited for adherence to good manufacturing practices. As of December 31, 2022, all North American Beverage Merchandising converting facilities have received Safe Quality Food certification, and 28 Foodservice and Food Merchandising facilities have achieved British Retail Consortium certification for meeting globally-recognized standards related to food safety and quality. Our mills, extrusion plant and 4 additional Foodservice facilities (the legacy Fabri-Kal facilities) are certified in accordance with FSSC 22000, another food safety certification scheme. The remaining sites, 11 manufacturing and 7 warehouse facilities, are certified following food safety and supplier assurance audits conducted by the National Sanitation Foundation.
 We are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits. Among other things, these requirements regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes, protect the health and safety of our employees, regulate the materials used in and the recycling of our products and impose liability, which can be strict, joint and several, for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances related to our current and former sites, as well as at third party sites where we or our predecessors have sent hazardous waste for disposal. Many of our manufacturing facilities require environmental permits, such as those limiting air and water emissions. Compliance with these permits can require capital investment and, in some cases, could limit production.
 In addition, a number of governmental authorities, both in the United States and abroad, have considered, and are expected to consider, legislation aimed at reducing the amount of plastic waste. For example, on June 30, 2022, California enacted the Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act, which, among other things, requires a 25% reduction of plastics in single-use products in the state by 2032 and escalating recycling, reuse or composting rates for single-use packaging, regardless of material, used in the state over time. Additional legislation of this type has included banning certain types of materials or products, mandating certain recycling rates and imposing fees or taxes on packaging material, which could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business.
 Moreover, as environmental issues, such as climate change, have become more prevalent, governments have responded, and are expected to continue to respond, with increased legislation and regulation, which could negatively affect us. For example, the United States Congress has in the past considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency regulates certain greenhouse gas emissions under existing laws such as the Clean Air Act. A number of states and local governments in the United States have also announced their intentions to implement their own programs to reduce greenhouse gases. These initiatives may cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental legislation or regulations, such as costs to upgrade or replace equipment, as well as increased indirect costs that could get passed through to us resulting from our suppliers and customers also incurring additional compliance costs.
 We have programs across our businesses to ensure we remain in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business, refer to the risk factor “We are subject to a complex framework of laws and regulations, including, among others, those relating to product quality and environmental protection, and may incur material liabilities under, or costs in order to comply with, existing or future laws and regulations” in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
 Environmental, Social and Governance
 Aligning purpose and performance creates value for companies, their employees and the community. Our Social Responsibility Key Strategic Initiative aligns our efforts across the Company around Environmental, Social and Governance matters.
Environmental
 Sustainable Products
 We offer products that deliver safe, fresh and convenient food and beverages. Our products help reduce food waste by protecting foods and beverages during transport, extending product shelf life and reducing the threat of contamination. Safety and convenience continue to be important as on-the-go consumption and delivery of foods and beverages drive growth in the industry.
 We continue to grow our offering of sustainable products with new, plant-based bio-resin and fiber-based offerings. Today, we provide customers sustainable alternatives across nearly all our products and categories. We offer products made from seven different types of sustainable substrates and nearly all are made in North America. We believe our EarthChoice brand is the largest brand of sustainable foodservice packaging in North America, with each product meeting at least one of our “Four Rs” of Reduce, Reuse, Recycle or Renew. Our Greenware and Recycleware brands, which we acquired as a part of the Fabri-Kal acquisition, complement our sustainable offerings, being made with renewable and recycled content materials, respectively.
 Through our state-of-the-art production technology and material science expertise, we can develop new value-add and sustainable solutions. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from changing consumer preferences for more environmentally sustainable products. In 2022, approximately 66% of our net revenues came from products made from recycled, recyclable or renewable materials, and we have set a goal of having 100% of our net revenues come from such products by 2030.
 In addition, many of our customers have publicly-stated goals to increase the use of sustainable products. A significant portion of our new product and material innovations is geared toward developing sustainable products for our customers, with over 100 new items launched since 2020. As customers look to switch to more sustainable alternatives, we are well-positioned to quickly and effectively support them, thanks to our teams of materials scientists and engineers. With a high percentage of our net revenues coming from products that are made from sustainable materials, we are helping our customers achieve their own sustainability goals. For instance, in the first quarter of 2022, we participated in the launch of McDonald’s new circular clear cups sourced from equal parts postconsumer recycled and biobased polypropylene. This biobased material is crafted in part from McDonald’s used cooking oil, demonstrating the potential for circularity in our industry.
 In addition to using recyclable and compostable materials, we support efforts to expand opportunities for consumers to recycle or compost our products, notably as one of the founding members of the Carton Council, Paper Recovery Alliance, Plastics Recovery Group, Foam Recycling Coalition and the Paper Cup Alliance. We have demonstrated our commitment to use more recycled plastic by joining the Association for Plastic Recyclers’ Demand Champions program. We engage with the composting industry through the U.S. Composting Council, and a growing number of our products are certified compostable by the Biodegradable Products Institute. We are a longstanding member of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, an industry working group aligned with our purpose: Packaging A Better Future.
 Sustainable Operations
 Our dedication to the environment goes beyond just the products we manufacture. Within our operations, we are working to limit our impact by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, optimizing water use and decreasing waste going to landfills. In 2022, we committed to the Science Based Targets initiative to set near- and long-term company-wide greenhouse gas emission reductions. By doing so, we seek to become part of the Business Ambition for 1.5°C and the UNFCCC Race to Zero campaign.
 Improving energy efficiency is critical to us as energy is one of our highest cost categories to manufacture our products. We are also looking to use more renewable energy, which further reduces our greenhouse gas emissions. Today, approximately half of our annual energy consumption comes from renewable sources including biomass, hydropower, wind and solar.
 Efforts to minimize our water usage take various forms, given the variety of our operations. We primarily use water for process operations, cooling and cleaning. The majority of our water use occurs at our two mills. Most of our water use is “non-consumptive use,” which means the water is treated and returned back to the environment after being used in our operations. We use data from the Water Resources Institute to analyze water basin conditions for each of our facilities. This annual process allows us to identify water-related risks and prioritize performance improvement measures. Our analysis in 2022 showed that 97% of our water intake occurs at our two mills, which are located in Low or Low-Medium Baseline Water Risk areas, and less than one percent of our water consumption occurs in regions with high or extremely high water stress. In 2022, to bring an additional level of accountability at the facility level, we included water management in our Pactiv Evergreen Production System, which is our structured approach to achieving operational excellence and world-class manufacturing and logistics infrastructure.
 Reducing waste in our operations is an ongoing, company-wide pursuit. We reuse a significant majority of plastic and paper scrap to manufacture our own products and implement programs to reduce scrap in production as much as possible. The plastic or paper scrap that cannot be reused in the manufacturing process is recycled by third parties where possible. In 2022, we started a waste and recycling audit at each of our facilities, with the goal of identifying improvement and efficiency areas to build our upcoming waste strategy.
 Protecting the sustainability of our forests is a critical initiative, given our broad use of paper through our product offerings. The paper and paperboard purchased from our U.S. paper suppliers are certified to meet internationally-recognized fiber sourcing standards.

Additionally, our North American paper production facilities have chain-of-custody certifications from independent, third-party certifiers. In recent years we have continually increased the amount of fiber we procure from these certified sources. In 2022, we published new goals related to sustainable forestry. As part of these new goals, we have established targets to reach, by the end of 2023, 100% of our applicable facilities in North America are chain of custody certified, and by the end of 2025, 100% of our procured virgin fiber meets the SFI Fiber Sourcing standard and the FSC Controlled Wood Standard. Additionally, we published an updated sustainable forestry policy, which can be found on our investor relations website at https://investors.pactivevergreen.com/esg-documents.

 Social and Human Capital Resources
 Our most valuable asset is our people, and our human capital management is evolving to meet the changing needs of today’s workforce.
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 16,000 people globally. We believe in supporting and empowering our employees through recognition, health and welfare benefits offerings, development opportunities and fair compensation. Approximately 30% of our employees are represented by labor unions. Our operations are subject to various local, national and multinational laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees. We are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements, and we endeavor to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire.
Workforce Health and Safety
 Safety is a core value and affects everything we do. Our manufacturing facilities have achieved safety metrics that are approximately three times better than the industry average in 2022. We had a total recordable incidence rate of 1.10 compared to the industry average of 3.00, a total lost time restricted time rate of 0.70 compared to the industry average of 2.10 and a total lost workday rate of 0.31 compared to an industry average of 1.10.
Corporate Culture
 Our purpose, mission and values represent the principles we honor, the promises we keep and the foundational beliefs we share. They communicate what our customers and shareholders can expect from us and what we can expect of each other. As we grow our brand, we are also mindful of the need to continue building on this values-based leadership. In 2022, we prioritized building corporate culture around our purpose of Packaging A Better Future and our values to Celebrate People, Do What’s Right, Win Together, Demand Excellence and Own It, including the creation of a Talent & Culture team. Our values-driven and people-centric culture supports diversity, innovative thinking, decisiveness and leadership skills — qualities that are essential in our fast-paced environment. We focus on promoting from within for rewarding careers and long-term growth. We know that we can support our employees in many ways: in 2022, we launched a new paid time off policy for new and existing salaried U.S.-based employees as well as a new tuition reimbursement policy.
In 2021, we launched the Pactiv Evergreen Give Back program, an annual initiative to reward employees and their families for living our values by supporting the communities where we live and work. As a food and beverage packaging company, we believe that we’re uniquely equipped to inspire action and support those in need, especially when it comes to food insecurity. In 2022, we held our first Give Back Month of Action. We experienced impressive engagement from every location, supporting numerous non-profits through many different volunteer events, donating thousands of hours of volunteer service and collecting non-perishable food items for local pantries. We also renewed our Give Back grant program, supporting the non-profits for which employees and their families volunteer, and received approximately three times as many applications as in 2021. We believe that the success of our Give Back program reflects our employees’ commitment to living our values and making a positive impact in our communities.
Diversity, Inclusion and Talent Development
 We focus on attracting and retaining a diverse workforce, and we are committed to being transparent when it comes to diversity. In 2022, we released metrics related to the ethnic background and diversity in leadership of our U.S.-based employees, which represented approximately 87% of our total workforce as of December 31, 2022. Also as of December 31, 2022, over 50% of our U.S.-based employees were Black, Indigenous or People of Color, including 21% of those in our senior or mid-level leadership positions. In addition, 28% of our employees were women, including 24% of those in our senior or mid-level leadership positions. In 2022, we were proud to be named a Military Times Best for Vets Employer, reflecting our commitment to supporting veterans at all phases of recruitment, employment and retention.
 Our diversity, equity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training and policies. Diversity, equity and inclusion are embedded into our leadership development courses, and in 2023 we intend to begin measuring diversity in our hiring and promotion rates.
 Looking beyond our own employees in 2022, we updated our procurement procedures to require vendors to certify whether they are diverse and conducted an analysis to better understand the diversity of our existing vendors. We also began auditing our Tier 1 and 2

suppliers to gain visibility into labor, health and safety, environmental and business ethics practices in our supply chain. To do that, we are partnering with Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (Sedex), one of the world’s leading ethical trade organizations.
 Governance
 The composition of our six-member Board of Directors includes two women, one of whom is Hispanic. Ms. LeighAnne Baker is our first female Board Chair. Ms. Baker has been an independent member of our Board since our initial public offering, and we are grateful to benefit from her leadership and experience. In an effort to strengthen corporate governance, in 2022 our Board of Directors confirmed that environmental, social and governance issues and corporate sustainability are subject to direct oversight by the full Board. We also began disclosing our greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption according to Sustainability Accounting Standards Board standards and publicly reported to CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) on climate, forestry and water security.
Policies and ongoing reporting on ESG initiatives and performance can be found on our investor relations website at https://investors.pactivevergreen.com/esg-documents and will be provided, free of charge, to any shareholder who requests a copy.
