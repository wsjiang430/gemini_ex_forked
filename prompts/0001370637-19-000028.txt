Item 1. Business.
Overview
Etsy is the global two-sided marketplace for unique and creative goods. Our mission is to “Keep Commerce Human,” and we’re committed to using the power of business and technology to strengthen communities and empower people around the world. We connect creative entrepreneurs with thoughtful consumers looking for items that are intended to be special, reflect their sense of style, or represent a meaningful occasion. Etsy was founded in June 2005 in Brooklyn, New York.
Our sellers are the heart and soul of Etsy, and our technology platform allows our sellers to turn their creative passions into economic opportunity. We have a seller-aligned business model: we make money when our sellers make money. We offer our sellers a marketplace with millions of buyers along with a range of seller tools and services that are specifically designed to help our creative entrepreneurs generate more sales and scale their businesses.
We are focused on attracting potential buyers to the Etsy marketplace for “special” purchase occasions throughout the year and deepening engagement with our existing buyers by inspiring purchases across multiple categories and special occasions. These special purchase occasions can occur many times throughout the year and include shopping that reflects an individual's unique style; gifting that demonstrates thought and care; and celebrations that express creativity and fun. Buyers tell us that they come to Etsy because Etsy sellers offer items that they can’t find anywhere else. In fact, in a 2018 survey of Etsy buyers, 78% of buyers agreed that Etsy has items that you can’t find anywhere else. 
Special purchase occasions happen throughout the year when a buyer is decorating a home, dressing for an event, celebrating a special moment, or buying a gift for someone special.

As of December 31, 2018, our marketplace connected 2.1 million active Etsy sellers to 39.4 million active Etsy buyers. Etsy buyers and sellers are located all over the world, and our six core geographic markets are the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, and France. We will continue to invest in these markets, as this is where we have our strongest concentration of both buyers and sellers, and continue to evaluate geographies in which to make strategic investments. There are currently more than 60 million items for sale across dozens of retail categories on Etsy.com. In 2018, our marketplace generated $3.9 billion of Gross Merchandise Sales, (“GMS”), of which approximately 55% came from purchases made on mobile devices. In 2018, our top six retail categories were: homewares and home furnishings, jewelry and personal accessories, apparel, craft supplies, paper and party supplies, and beauty and personal care. We are a global company and 35% of our 2018 GMS was generated when the Etsy seller or Etsy buyer, or both, were located outside of the United States.
Our revenue is diversified, generated from a mix of marketplace activities and other optional services we provide to Etsy sellers to help them generate more sales and scale their businesses.
Marketplace revenue is comprised of the fees an Etsy seller pays us for marketplace activities. Marketplace activities include listing an item for sale, completing transactions between a buyer and a seller, and using Etsy Payments to process payments, including foreign currency payments. Fees include the 5% transaction fee that an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction, inclusive of shipping fees charged, the $0.20 listing fee she pays for each item she lists (for up to four months) on Etsy.com, and fees for Etsy Payments, our payment processing product. On July 16, 2018, we increased our seller transaction fee from 3.5% to 5%, and now apply it to the cost of shipping in addition to the cost of the item. The revised fee structure is intended to support increased investments in the growth and health of the marketplace. Revenue from Etsy Payments, included in Services revenue prior to 2018, is now included in Marketplace revenue because Etsy Payments is required to be used by Etsy sellers in the countries where it is available.
Services revenue, formerly called Seller Services revenue, is comprised of the fees an Etsy seller pays us for our optional services (“Services”). Services include Promoted Listings, our on-site advertising service that allows sellers to pay for prominent placement of their listings in search results; Etsy Shipping Labels, which allows sellers in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia to purchase discounted shipping labels; Pattern, a service that allows sellers to build custom websites; and Etsy Plus, a subscription offering that provides sellers with enhanced tools and credits for use on our platform. 
We also generate additional revenue through our commercial partnerships, which is classified as other revenue.

Our Opportunity
We believe that the nature of commerce is continuing to evolve: more people are choosing to purchase goods online and many consumers are looking for unique items as an alternative to mass produced goods. According to estimates by Euromonitor, a market research company, worldwide retail ecommerce will generate double-digit growth each year through 2022, and worldwide retail ecommerce sales will reach $3 trillion by the end of 2022. (Source: Euromonitor — Worldwide Internet Retailing.) We estimate that, in 2018, the online market size across all relevant retail categories within our six core geographic markets; United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, and France, represents a $249 billion market opportunity, and a $1.7 trillion market opportunity when offline is included.
Our Platform
Etsy leverages technology to connect people around the world through commerce. Our platform includes our marketplace, our seller tools and services, our passionate and engaged sellers and buyers, and our technology. Our commitment to transparency and integrity underpins our platform and establishes trust within our marketplace and our community. 

Key Components of Our Platform

Our Marketplace
Our marketplace, Etsy.com, is where thoughtful buyers come to discover a broad selection of unique goods that are hard to find elsewhere. In a world of increasing automation and commoditization, Etsy celebrates creativity and human interaction. 
We believe our marketplace is characterized by several unique qualities, including:

• | Unique Products: Our marketplace boasts a large assortment of handmade, customized, personalized, vintage, and craft supply products from all of the world. There are currently more than 60 million items listed on our marketplace. We intend to continue to improve the customer experience by investing in our search and discovery capabilities to help buyers efficiently find the special items they are looking for and deliver a brand promise around shipping to align with our buyers’ expectations of when they can expect to receive our unique items.


• | Global Reach: Etsy’s six core geographic markets are the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, and France, and there are people using our platform to buy and sell in nearly every country around the world. Our platform makes it easy for Etsy buyers and Etsy sellers to interact across borders even if they do not speak the same language and wish to transact in different currencies. We use innovative machine translation technology to translate listings, reviews, Promoted Listings, and conversations between Etsy buyers and Etsy sellers. Our payments platform allows Etsy sellers to offer Etsy buyers a wide range of payment options. In 2018, 37% of Etsy sellers were located outside the United States, and 35% of our GMS was generated between an Etsy seller, Etsy buyer, or both, located outside of the United States.


• | Organic Traffic Base: We’ve built a loyal, global base of buyers on the platform without significant investment in acquisition marketing until 2013, eight years after being founded. Unlike many other ecommerce companies, the vast majority of visits to Etsy.com came through organic channels. In fact, approximately, 85% of visits in 2018 were from organic sources, including a large portion from buyers visiting Etsy.com directly as well as from non-paid channels such as search, social, email, and push notifications.


• | Connection Between Buyers and Sellers: We believe that human connection is central to buyer engagement. On Etsy, we emphasize that the items listed for sale are brought to life by real people. Additionally, buyers are able to connect directly with sellers in order to ask questions and personalize or customize items to their specifications. We also encourage buyers

3

and sellers to connect in a variety of other ways, such as through sharing reviews on social media or connecting off-line through the Etsy Local feature on our mobile app. We believe that meaningful interactions with Etsy sellers differentiates us from other e-commerce platforms, drives buyer engagement, and keeps our buyers coming back. 

• | Connected Experience Across all Devices: We want to engage Etsy buyers wherever they are and to provide an enjoyable and accessible shopping experience no matter how they come to Etsy. Our mobile website and our “Buy on Etsy” mobile app for Etsy buyers include search and discovery, curation, personalization and social shopping features. Our Etsy.com iOS and Android mobile apps have been downloaded approximately 56 million times as of December 31, 2018. We offer a connected experience through each channel, desktop, mobile web, and mobile app, to help ensure that no matter what device our buyers use they will have the best possible experience. For the year ended December 31, 2018 approximately 55% of our GMS was generated on a mobile device. This is an increase compared with 2017, during which 51% of our GMS was generated on a mobile device. We are focused on increasing conversion rates in general; however, we are particularly focused on mobile web, which continued to be the largest driver of both overall visits growth and mobile GMS growth. Mobile web conversion rate is about half the conversion rate on desktop and the conversion rate on our mobile Buy on Etsy app is about 1.2x the desktop conversion rate. Therefore, if mobile web visits continue to grow as a percentage of overall visits, it could be a headwind to future conversion rate gains.


• | Buyer Intent; People Come to Etsy to Browse and be Inspired: Our platform is designed to provide a personalized search experience to Etsy buyers, adjusting in real time based on transaction data and previous browsing history. A large portion of our buyers come to Etsy not in search of a specific item, but to browse and be inspired. We are continuing to build more sophisticated algorithms that allow us to deliver more personalized results to our buyers, utilizing browse and transaction data to surface items they didn’t know they wanted. In 2018, we launched a number of products to enhance search, including adding recommendations to item landing pages and incorporating more attributes to our search algorithm to improve search ranking. All of this helps bring fun to the discovery and shopping experience. We believe we have significant opportunities to further enhance our search and discovery capabilities and plan to leverage our machine learning technology to deliver an even more personalized shopping experience. In addition, our full migration to Google Cloud by the beginning of 2020 is expected to further improve our search and discovery effectiveness.

Etsy sellers are required to pay a fixed listing fee of $0.20 for each item listed on Etsy.com for a period of four months or, if earlier, until a sale occurs. Once a sale is consummated, sellers pay variable transaction fees and Etsy Payments fees. On July 16, 2018, we increased our seller transaction fee from 3.5% to 5%, and now apply it to the cost of shipping in addition to the cost of the item. Etsy Payments processing fees vary between 3% to 4.5% of an item’s total sale price, including shipping, plus a flat fee per order, depending on the country in which a seller’s bank account is located. When a foreign currency payment is processed, an additional 2.5% to 5% fee is applied. As of December 31, 2018, Etsy Payments was available in 36 countries and 12 currencies and nearly all sellers in countries where Etsy Payments is available are required to use the service. In fact, 86% of total GMS was processed through Etsy Payments in 2018, up from 85% in 2017. Our ability to expand Etsy Payments into additional countries is dependent upon the third-party providers we use to support this service.
Our Seller Tools and Services
Seller tools and services help Etsy sellers generate more sales and scale their businesses. In addition to driving incremental revenue streams to Etsy, these offerings play a key role in supporting sellers’ businesses and driving sales. Our optional paid services are (in order of 2018 revenue contribution): Promoted Listings, Etsy Shipping Labels, Pattern, and subscription packages. Services revenue grew 42.1%, and represented 26.3% of our total revenue, up from 25.4% in 2017. 

• | Promoted Listings: Promoted Listings enable Etsy sellers to pay a cost-per-click based fee to feature and promote their goods in our marketplace in search results generated by Etsy buyers. This service allows Etsy sellers to target Etsy buyers who are specifically searching for goods similar to those she offers for sale. During 2018, 15.1% of active sellers used Promoted Listings up from 15.0% in 2017. In 2018, we enhanced Promoted Listings by expanding inventory across all devices and adding context specific search ranking to improve ad relevance and higher click-through rates, which both led to accelerated year-over-year revenue growth for this service. We optimized our sellers’ budgets and generated a positive return on their spend in 2018. We aim for sellers to be ROI positive and often utilize less than their allocated budget.


• | Etsy Shipping Labels: This service allows sellers in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia to purchase discounted United States Postal Service, FedEx, Canada Post, Royal Mail, and DAI Post shipping labels through our platform. The ability to print the shipping labels at home reduces the cost and time it takes Etsy sellers to ship items to Etsy buyers, reduces the chance for administrative error through features such as auto population of shipping addresses, and automatically provides tracking information when available and shipping notifications to buyers. During 2018, 24.7% of active sellers in regions where Etsy Shipping Labels is offered used this product, down from 28.1% in 2017. The reduction in percentage of active sellers using Etsy Shipping Labels was driven by the expansion of the service in the United

4

Kingdom and Australia in late 2018 where adoption could take some time to develop. Despite this, year-over-year revenue growth for this service accelerated compared to 2017 driven by GMS growth.

• | Pattern: With Pattern, Etsy sellers can create their own custom websites with unique domain names within minutes. Pattern imports listings and content from Etsy shops, syncs inventory and orders, and utilizes our Etsy Payments and Etsy Shipping Label services. In 2018, we began allowing sellers to sell items or services on their Pattern website that don’t follow the handmade and vintage guidelines within our Etsy.com marketplace. Sellers may use Pattern for free for the first 30 days, then they are charged $15 per month, plus payment processing fees and Etsy Shipping Label fees, if they choose to use this service.


• | Subscription Packages: Our subscription packages were launched in July 2018 as a way for us to bundle and simplify our offerings for sellers. The Etsy Plus subscription package, which allows sellers to pay for enhanced tools and credits to use on the Etsy.com platform, is $10 per month and features enhanced tools such as advanced shop customization options, targeted restock notifications, discounts on branded packaging and promotional materials, and free or discounted custom web addresses. Additionally, Etsy Plus includes $5 of Promoted Listing credits and 15 free listing credits per month.

We believe we can grow our optional paid services in three ways: expand the utility of existing services, expand the geographic reach of existing services, and launch new services offerings. In addition to our paid services, we provide a wide range of tools and educational resources to give Etsy sellers the support they need to manage the administrative side of their businesses. According to our bi-annual seller survey, most recently conducted in 2018, for every hour that an Etsy seller spends making her products, she spends almost another hour doing business-related tasks, including inventory management, marketing, shipping, customer service, and accounting. Our tools and educational resources help manage these administrative burdens.

• | Seller Tools: We offer a variety of free tools to Etsy sellers, including marketing tools such as our Google Shopping tool. Google Shopping gives our sellers a complementary way to target buyers outside of the Etsy marketplace at key moments when they are searching for items on Google. Sellers set a daily budget and a target country or a number of geographies through their Shop Manager dashboard and we optimize their budget and target a return on their spend. Our Shop Manager dashboard, which we launched in 2017, serves as a centralized hub for Etsy sellers to track orders, manage inventory, view metrics and statistics, and have conversations with their customers across all of their Etsy shops. In 2018, we added a single, easy-to-use interface that streamlines sellers’ bills and payments accounts. Other marketing tools include Targeted Offers, our sales and promotions tool, and our social media tool, which help sellers with their marketing needs and allows them to stand out on and off the Etsy platform. Also, through a partnership with Intuit, sellers in the United States and the United Kingdom can simplify their accounting and bookkeeping.


• | Education: We provide extensive educational resources to teach Etsy sellers how to start, manage, and scale their businesses on our platform, including blog posts, video tutorials, the Etsy Seller Handbook (available on Etsy.com), Etsy.com online forums, and insights from Etsy.com support teams. In addition to our resources, Etsy sellers connect through self-organized Etsy Teams to build personal relationships with other Etsy sellers, collaborate, educate, and support each other as they build their independent creative businesses. Currently, over 16,000 Etsy Teams have formed around the world.

Etsy’s focus on supporting our sellers in starting, managing, and scaling their businesses strengthens our marketplace and positions it for continued growth. When our sellers succeed, Etsy succeeds.

Key 2018 Investments
Marketing: In July 2018, we revised our fee structure which enabled us to invest more in marketing while maintaining our return on investment. We increased digital marketing spend by 58.5% in 2018 to $112.2 million, and continued to optimize our marketing attribution model. We experimented with offline marketing and television advertising tests in the second half of 2018, and conducted pre- and post-brand awareness research to supplement our quantitative data. 
Google Cloud: We made progress and are on track with our migration to Google Cloud, which we expect to complete by the beginning of 2020. Among other anticipated benefits discussed below, we believe the migration will enhance our overall infrastructure by providing faster processing speed, improved page load time and more nimble server capacity on an as needed basis. 
Search: We continued investing in our machine learning capabilities in order to help buyers find the right selection of products, from the over 60 million items available in our marketplace. In 2018, we improved search relevance and began localizing search results by using context specific ranking. 
Customer Support: Our partnership with Zendesk supported improvements to our customer experience and lower costs. We introduced live chat for our sellers, and dedicated 24x7 phone support for both buyers and sellers. 
Shipping: We made progress evolving our search algorithms in order to more prominently promote items that have competitively priced shipping, introduced shipping price notifications for sellers, and launched the ability for sellers to display an expected delivery date. Also, in 2018, we expanded our Etsy Shipping Labels offering to sellers in the United Kingdom and Australia.

Our Passionate and Engaged Sellers and Buyers
Etsy Sellers
Our sellers are the backbone of Etsy’s business and what matters most to them is our community of over 39 million buyers. In order to continue to support our sellers’ growth, we are focused on making Etsy the best place to start and run a creative business. We serve those creative entrepreneurs around the world who choose to pursue their passions, offering them a global base of millions of buyers and a cohesive suite of tools and services to help them run their business and drive sales. Etsy sellers range from hobbyists to professional merchants, and have a broad range of personal and professional goals. Our 2018 seller survey found that 60% of Etsy sellers are multi-channel sellers and on average Etsy is their primary source of sales. 
According to the 2018 seller survey:

• | 87% identify as women;


• | 75% consider their Etsy shop to be a business;


• | 97% run their shops from their homes;


• | 82% aspire to grow their sales in the future; and


• | 64% started their Etsy shop as a way to supplement income.

Our 2018 seller survey found that 32% of Etsy sellers were pursuing their creative business as their sole occupation. In addition to our 2018 seller survey, we conducted a separate survey of our top decile sellers in 2017. Key findings included that 95% of our top decile sellers intended to remain with Etsy for the next 12 months.

Etsy Sellers

Etsy Buyers
Etsy supports a community of over 39 million buyers, who value self expression, unique items, and buying directly from creative entrepreneurs. In a 2018 survey of Etsy.com buyers, 78% of buyers agreed that Etsy offers products they cannot find anywhere else. Etsy buyers can enjoy a personalized shopping experience and build relationships through direct interactions with Etsy sellers. Etsy buyers can also purchase customized items and craft supplies from Etsy sellers. By shopping on Etsy.com, Etsy buyers are supporting creative entrepreneurs in their local communities and around the world.
We are focused on driving more new buyers to the platform and encouraging existing buyers to purchase more often. New buyers are considered unique buyers that have never made a purchase on Etsy. During 2018, we had 17.5 million new buyers, which represented approximately 18% of overall GMS. GMS from new buyers was up 16% year-over-year. GMS from existing buyers grew 23% year-over-year in 2018 and represented approximately 82% of overall GMS, an increase compared to last year.
7

Repeat buyers represent shoppers who have ever bought on Etsy, regardless of when their first purchase day occurred. We believe repeat purchases demonstrate the loyalty of Etsy buyers. In 2018, approximately 40.1% of our active buyers made purchases on two or more days in the previous 12 months, a slight increase compared to last year. Within that category, we are particularly focused on increasing our number of habitual buyers, or buyers who have spent $200 or more and made purchases on six or more days in the previous 12 months. As of December 31, 2018, habitual buyers grew to 2.0 million, an increase of 21.7% compared to 2017. This is faster than overall active buyer growth, indicating our efforts to convert buyers into more loyal shoppers on the platform are seeing signs of success.

Unlike many other ecommerce companies, the vast majority of visits come to Etsy from organic channels. In 2018, 85% of visits came to Etsy.com from an organic source, including a large portion from buyers visiting Etsy.com directly as well as from non-paid channels such as search, social, email, and push notifications. Paid visits are attributed to visits generated from our marketing efforts. Over the last five years, paid visits have increased as a percentage of total visits as a result of our increased investment in marketing. A visit represents activity from a unique browser or mobile app. A visit ends after 30 minutes of inactivity.

Etsy Seller & Buyer Retention
Our active sellers and active buyers typically remain so for multiple years. For example, 33.1% of active sellers and 37.5% of active buyers as of December 31, 2015 continued to be active sellers and active buyers through their fourth year on the platform and 31.8% of active sellers and 38.7% of active buyers as of December 31, 2014 continued to be active sellers and active buyers through their fourth year on the platform. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, 19.6% of active sellers have been selling on Etsy for more than four years. Likewise, as of December 31, 2018, 24.5% of active buyers have been Etsy buyers for more than four years.

Our Technology 
Our widely respected engineering team has built a sophisticated platform that enables millions of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to smoothly transact across borders, languages, and devices. We collect and analyze large volumes of data to enhance the performance of our platform. For example, on average, we capture roughly one billion user-generated events every day to produce personalized recommendations, improve our search experience and test features on our website. 
Our use of machine learning algorithms creates an engaging shopping experience and also helps Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers connect across our platform. We apply proprietary machine learning to the search and discovery processes, enabling shoppers to more easily browse, filter, and buy that perfect item, even when they may not have something specific in mind.
Machine translation and machine learning also play an important role in making it easy for Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to connect even if they don’t speak the same language. We translate listings within our Etsy.com market into 10 languages which we believe significantly increases the inventory available to non-English speaking Etsy buyers and gives Etsy sellers access to a truly global audience.
Our technology infrastructure allows us to scale our efforts across the platform. In late 2017, we announced our migration to Google Cloud, which we believe will enable us to focus on growing our core Etsy.com marketplace, prioritize the buyer and seller experience, improve our search and discovery effectiveness, and increase the pace of launching new features. We expect the migration will result in increased engineering efficiency shifting the focus from maintaining on-premise systems to product engineering work that is more strategic. We also believe the migration will enhance our overall infrastructure by providing faster processing speed, improved page load time, and more nimble fulfillment to capacity on an as needed basis. In the third quarter of 2018, we achieved a significant milestone by successfully migrating our website and mobile apps to Google Cloud. We expect to complete the migration by the beginning of 2020.
Commitment to Integrity and Transparency
Members of our community rely on us to maintain a trusted marketplace. Our policies are designed to encourage transparency and clearly outline the rights and responsibilities of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers participating on our platform. Most fundamentally, we require that goods listed in our marketplace be handmade or unique and assembled with production partners, vintage, or craft supplies. 
Transparency within our community helps to support our trustworthiness. For example, we publish an annual report that details progress toward our ideals and shares our hopes for the years to come. We also annually report statistics regarding shops that do not meet our guidelines or which list items that are alleged to infringe third party rights. In 2018, we closed 3,609 Etsy.com shops that were subject to repeat notices of intellectual property infringement and closed 109,473 Etsy.com accounts for non-IP policy violations.
Additionally, we are focused on enhancing customer service for Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers, which we believe bolsters the trustworthiness of our marketplace. In 2018, we migrated our legacy support platform to a new third-party customer service platform, Zendesk, to improve our customer experience. This migration enabled us to introduce live chat for our sellers, and dedicated 24x7 phone support for both buyers and sellers. 
We strive to give the Etsy buyer comfort that she is purchasing goods from a shop that adheres to certain principles. Etsy buyers have a high degree of insight into Etsy sellers’ business practices. Our policies ask Etsy sellers to be transparent about themselves, their businesses and the goods they sell. We also have dedicated teams and sophisticated tools to help enforce our policies. For example, our Integrity team uses a combination of machine learning, automated systems, and community-generated flags to review items and shops that may violate our policies. Our Trust and Safety team helps to prevent and detect fraud through human review and automated tools and algorithms. We also recognize that sometimes transactions don’t go as planned. When that happens, our online Case System provides a way for Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to communicate with each other to resolve disputes. In 2018, 0.3% of orders resulted in a case. We also establish trust by emphasizing the person behind every transaction. We deepen connections between Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers through our direct communication tools, seller stories on our website and apps, and in-person events, highlighting personal relationships as a key part of the Etsy experience. For example, Etsy sellers are encouraged to share their stories to reach Etsy buyers on our platform and on social media. The trustworthiness of our marketplace and the connections among people in our community are cornerstones of our business.

Our Strategy 
Since mid-2017, we have focused our strategy on growing the Etsy.com marketplace in our six core geographies and executing upon four key initiatives to make Etsy a better place to shop and sell. These initiatives involved making investments and improvements in search and discovery, trust and reliability, marketing capabilities, and seller tools and services. Successfully delivering on these initiatives has resulted in significant improvements to and growth of our marketplace.
In order to deliver sustainable long-term growth, we are building upon this strategy to incorporate additional elements that we believe, over time, will make Etsy a best-in-class marketplace. Our investments in product, marketing, and talent will be focused on capitalizing on what we believe are our core competitive advantages; or what we think of as our “Right to Win.”
The foundation of Etsy’s competitive advantage is our collection of unique items, which, we believe, when combined with best-in-class search and discovery, human connections, and a trusted brand, will enable us to continue to stand out among other ecommerce platforms and marketplaces. We will lean into the humanity and vibrancy of our market, increasing the connection between buyers and sellers, establishing strong trust signals for product quality and customer experience, removing barriers to purchase, and giving sellers more ways to generate sales and scale their businesses.
Ultimately, the goal of our long-term strategy is to drive more new buyers to the website, give existing buyers reasons to come back more often, encourage buyers to spend more per order, and fuel success for our sellers, which we believe will drive growth. Etsy has a significant number of habitual buyers (Etsy buyers that have purchased $200 or more on Etsy.com and have made purchases on six or more purchase days in the last 12 months) and we believe we have the ability to attract many more buyers like them to Etsy and convert them into habitual buyers. For example, we believe we can deepen engagement with our existing buyers by inspiring purchases in additional categories and on additional occasions. We also plan to continue supporting our sellers by focusing on enhancing the seller tools and services that will drive buyer demand. We believe that we are just getting started improving this virtuous cycle of growth.
