ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. (“CBL”) was organized on July 13, 1993, as a Delaware corporation, to acquire substantially all of the real estate properties owned by CBL & Associates, Inc., which was formed by Charles B. Lebovitz in 1978, and by certain of its related parties.  On November 3, 1993, CBL completed an initial public offering (the “Offering”). Simultaneously with the completion of the Offering, CBL & Associates, Inc., its shareholders and affiliates and certain senior officers of the Company (collectively, “CBL’s Predecessor”) transferred substantially all of their interests in its real estate properties to CBL & Associates Limited Partnership (the “Operating Partnership”) in exchange for common units of limited partner interest in the Operating Partnership. The interests in the Operating Partnership contain certain conversion rights that are more fully described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The terms “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the Company or the Company and the Operating Partnership collectively, as the context requires. 
The Company’s Business
We are a self-managed, self-administered, fully integrated REIT. We own, develop, acquire, lease, manage, and operate regional shopping malls, open-air and mixed-use centers, outlet centers, associated centers, community centers, office and other properties. Our Properties are located in 26 states, but are primarily in the southeastern and midwestern United States. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.
We conduct substantially all of our business through CBL & Associates Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership"), which is a variable interest entity ("VIE"). We are the 100% owner of two qualified REIT subsidiaries, CBL Holdings I, Inc. and CBL Holdings II, Inc. CBL Holdings I, Inc. is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. At December 31, 2018, CBL Holdings I, Inc. owned a 1.0% general partner interest and CBL Holdings II, Inc. owned an 85.6% limited partner interest in the Operating Partnership, for a combined interest held by us of 86.6%.
See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on our Properties as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we owned mortgages on seven Properties, each of which is collateralized by either a first mortgage, a second mortgage or by assignment of 100% of the ownership interests in the underlying real estate and related improvements (the “Mortgages”). The Malls, All Other Properties ("Associated Centers, Community Centers, Office Buildings and Self-storage Facilities"), Properties under development ("Construction Properties") and Mortgages are collectively referred to as the “Properties” and individually as a “Property.”
We conduct our property management and development activities through CBL & Associates Management, Inc. (the “Management Company”) to comply with certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code").  The Operating Partnership owns 100% of the Management Company’s outstanding preferred stock and common stock.
The Management Company manages all but 11 of the Properties. Governor’s Square and Governor’s Square Plaza in Clarksville, TN, Kentucky Oaks Mall in Paducah, KY, Fremaux Town Center in Slidell, LA, Ambassador Town Center in Lafayette, LA and EastGate Mall - CubeSmart Self-storage in Cincinnati, OH are all owned by unconsolidated joint ventures and are managed by a property manager that is affiliated with the third party partner, which receives a fee for its services. The third party partner of each of these Properties controls the cash flow distributions, although our approval is required for certain major decisions.  The Outlet Shoppes at Gettysburg in Gettysburg, PA, The Outlet Shoppes at El Paso in El Paso, TX, The Outlet Shoppes at Atlanta in Woodstock, GA, The Outlet Shoppes of the Bluegrass in Simpsonville, KY, and The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo in Laredo, TX are owned by consolidated joint ventures and managed by a property manager that is affiliated with the third party partner, which receives a fee for its services. 
Revenues are primarily derived from leases with retail tenants and generally include fixed minimum rents, percentage rents based on tenants’ sales volumes and reimbursements from tenants for expenditures related to real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance ("CAM") and other recoverable operating expenses, as well as certain capital expenditures. We also generate revenues from management, leasing and development fees, sponsorships, sales of peripheral land at the Properties and from sales of operating real estate assets when it is determined that we can realize an appropriate value for the assets. Proceeds from such sales are generally used to retire related indebtedness or reduce outstanding balances on our credit facilities.

Growth Strategy
Our objective is to achieve growth in same-center net operating income ("NOI") as well as funds from operations ("FFO") (see page 76 for a discussion of funds from operations) and reduce our overall cost of debt and equity by maximizing total earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate ("EBITDAre") and cash flows through a variety of methods as further discussed below. 
FFO and same-center NOI are non-GAAP measures. For a description of same-center NOI, a reconciliation from net income (loss) to same-center NOI, and an explanation of why we believe this is a useful performance measure, see Non-GAAP Measure - Same-center Net Operating Income in “Results of Operations.” For a description of FFO, a reconciliation from net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders, and an explanation of why we believe this is a useful performance measure, see Non-GAAP Measure - Funds from Operations within the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section.

 Leasing, Management and Marketing
Our objective is to maximize cash flows from our existing Properties through:

▪ | aggressive leasing that seeks to increase occupancy and facilitate an optimal merchandise mix,


▪ | originating and renewing leases at higher gross rents per square foot compared to the previous lease,


▪ | merchandising, marketing, sponsorship and promotional activities and


▪ | actively controlling operating costs.

Redevelopments 
Redevelopments represent situations where we capitalize on opportunities to increase the productivity of previously occupied space through aesthetic upgrades, retenanting and/or changing the use of the space. Many times, redevelopments result from acquiring or regaining possession of Anchor space (such as former Sears and Bon-Ton stores) and subdividing it into multiple spaces. 
Renovations
Renovations usually include remodeling and upgrading existing facades, uniform signage, new entrances and floor coverings, updating interior décor, resurfacing parking areas and improving the lighting of interiors and parking areas. Renovations can result in attracting new retailers, increased rental rates, sales and occupancy levels and maintaining the Property's market dominance. 
Development of New Retail Properties and Expansions
In general, we seek development opportunities in middle-market trade areas that we believe are under-served by existing retail operations. These middle-markets must also have strong demographics to provide the opportunity to effectively maintain a competitive position. 
We can also generate revenues by expanding a Property through the addition of large retail formats including restaurants and entertainment venues. An expansion also protects the Property's competitive position within its market. 
Shadow Development Pipeline
We are continually pursuing redevelopment opportunities and have projects in various stages of pre-development. Our shadow pipeline consists of projects for Properties on which we have completed initial analysis and design but which have not commenced construction as of December 31, 2018. 
See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section for information on the above projects completed during 2018 and under construction at December 31, 2018.
Acquisitions
We believe there is opportunity for growth through acquisitions of retail centers and anchor stores that complement our portfolio. We selectively acquire properties we believe can appreciate in value by increasing NOI through our development, leasing and management expertise. However, our primary focus at this time is on opportunities to acquire anchors at our Properties for future redevelopment uses. 
Environmental Matters
A discussion of the current effects and potential impacts on our business and Properties of compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations is presented in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the subheading “Risks Related to Real Estate Investments.”
Competition
The Properties compete with various shopping facilities in attracting retailers to lease space. In addition, retailers at our Properties face competition from discount shopping centers, outlet centers, wholesale clubs, direct mail, television shopping networks, the internet and other retail shopping developments. The extent of the retail competition varies from market to market. We work aggressively to attract customers through marketing promotions and social media campaigns. Many of our retailers have adopted an omni-channel approach which leverages sales through both digital and traditional retailing channels.
 5

Seasonality
The shopping center business is, to some extent, seasonal in nature with tenants typically achieving the highest levels of sales during the fourth quarter due to the holiday season, which generally results in higher percentage rent income in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the Malls earn most of their “temporary” rents (rents from short-term tenants) during the holiday period. Thus, occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year. Results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of our fiscal year.

Our authorized common stock consists of 350,000,000 shares at $0.01 par value per share.
