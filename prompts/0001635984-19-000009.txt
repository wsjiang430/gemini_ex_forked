ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
National Western Life Group, Inc. ("NWLGI"), a Delaware Corporation, is the parent holding company which was established effective October 1, 2015 under a holding company plan of reorganization. As a result of the reorganization, NWLGI replaced National Western Life Insurance Company as the publicly held company at that time with the latter becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of NWLGI.
National Western Life Insurance Company (hereinafter referred to as "National Western" or "company" where insurance operations are being discussed) is a stock life insurance company, chartered in the State of Colorado in 1956, currently licensed to do business in all states (except for New York), the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories or possessions.  National Western is also licensed in Haiti. National Western has historically provided life insurance products on a global basis for the savings and protection needs of policyholders and annuity contracts for the asset accumulation and retirement needs of contract holders. As disclosed in the Form 10-Q filed by NWLGI for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the company discontinued accepting applications for the company's international products from all remaining foreign residents in May 2018. Since 2015, the company had progressively disengaged from accepting applications for its international products from residents of certain countries culminating in the decision to discontinue accepting applications from residents of all other territories. At December 31, 2018, the company maintained approximately 105,500 policies for its life insurance products and 126,900 annuity contracts.

The Company's total assets decreased to $11.9 billion at December 31, 2018, from $12.2 billion at December 31, 2017. The Company generated revenues of $551.6 million, $874.4 million and $682.4 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, NWLGI generated net income of $116.8 million, $110.4 million and $100.9 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Products
National Western offers a broad portfolio of individual whole life, universal life and term insurance plans, and annuities, including supplementary riders. In the following discussion, the Company reports sales and other statistical information. These statistics are derived from various sales tracking and administrative systems and are not derived from the Company's financial reporting systems or financial statements. These statistics are used to measure the relative progress of our marketing and acquisition efforts. Sales data for traditional life insurance is based upon annualized premiums, while universal life sales are based on annualized "target" premiums which are those premiums upon which full first year commissions are paid. Sales of annuities are measured based on the amount of deposits received. These statistics attempt to measure only some of the many factors that may affect future profitability, and therefore, are not intended to be predictive of future profitability.
Life Products. The company's life products provide protection for the life of the insured and, in some cases, allow for cash value accumulation on a tax-deferred basis. These product offerings include universal life insurance ("UL"), interest-sensitive whole life, and traditional products such as term insurance coverage. Interest sensitive products such as UL accept premiums that are applied to an account value. Deducted from the account value are costs of insurance charges which vary by age, gender, plan, and class of insurance, as well as various expense charges. Interest is credited to account values at a fixed interest rate generally determined in advance and guaranteed for a policy year at a time, subject to minimum guaranteed rates specified in the policy contract. A slight variation to this general interest crediting practice involves equity-index universal life ("EIUL") policies whose credited interest may be linked in part to an outside index at the election of the policyholder. These products offer both flexible and fixed premium modes and provide policyholders with flexibility in the available coverage, the timing and amount of premium payments and the amount of the death benefit, provided there are sufficient policy funds to cover all policy charges for the coming year. Traditional products generally provide for a fixed death benefit payable in exchange for regular premium payments.
 4

Annuity Products. Annuity products sold include flexible premium and single premium deferred annuities, equity-index (fixed-index) annuities, and single premium immediate annuities. These products can be tax qualified or nonqualified annuities. A fixed single premium deferred annuity ("SPDA") provides for a single premium payment at the time of issue, an accumulation period, and an annuity payout period commencing at some future date. A flexible premium deferred annuity ("FPDA") provides the same features but allows, generally with some conditions, additional payments into the contract. Interest is credited to the account value of the annuity initially at a current rate of interest which is guaranteed for a period of time, typically the first year. After this period, the interest credited is subject to change based upon market rates and product profitability subject to a minimum guaranteed rate specified in the contract. Interest accrues during the accumulation period generally on a tax-deferred basis to the contract holder. After a number of years specified in the annuity contract, the owner may elect to have the proceeds paid as a single payment or as a series of payments over a period of time. The owner is permitted at any time during the accumulation period to withdraw all or part of the annuity account balance subject to contract provisions such as surrender charges and market value adjustments. A fixed-index deferred annuity performs essentially in the same manner as SPDAs and FPDAs with the exception that, in addition to a fixed interest crediting option, the contract holder has the ability to elect an interest crediting mechanism that is linked, in part, to an outside index. A single premium immediate annuity ("SPIA") foregoes the accumulation period and immediately commences an annuity payout period.

Operating Segments
The company manages its business between Domestic Insurance Operations and International Insurance Operations.  For segment reporting purposes, the company's annuity business is separately identified. The Company also has a corporate segment, which consists of the assets and activities of wholly owned subsidiaries that have not been allocated to any other operating segment.
Domestic Insurance Operations. The company is currently licensed to do business in all states and the District of Columbia, except for New York.  Products marketed are annuities, universal life insurance, and traditional life insurance, which include both term and whole life products.  The company's domestic sales have historically been more heavily weighted toward the company's annuities.  More recently, a greater proportion of sales activity has been derived from single premium life insurance products, predominantly those with equity-index crediting mechanisms. National Western markets and distributes its domestic products primarily through independent national marketing organizations ("NMOs").  These NMOs assist the company in recruiting, contracting, and managing independent agents.  The company's agents are independent contractors who are compensated on a commission basis.  At December 31, 2018, the company's NMO relationships had contracted approximately 31,300 independent agents with the company. At December 31, 2018, the company had 49,000 domestic life insurance policies in force representing $3.2 billion in face amount of coverage and 126,900 annuity contracts representing account balances of $7.7 billion.
The following table sets forth the company's domestic life insurance sales as measured in annualized first year premium for the last three years.

Traditional life | 414 | | | 96 | | 112 | 
Total | $ | 24,584 | | | 18,994 | | 16,511

International Insurance Operations. National Western's international operations had generally focused on foreign nationals in upper socioeconomic classes.  Insurance products issued were primarily to residents of countries in South America with product offerings not available in the local markets. Issuing policies to residents of countries in these different regions had provided diversification that helped to minimize large fluctuations that could arise due to various economic, political, and competitive pressures that could occur from one country to another.  Products issued to international residents were almost entirely universal life and traditional life insurance products. 
As disclosed in the Company's 2018 first quarter report on Form 10-Q, the company ceased accepting applications from residents of Venezuela during the first quarter of 2018 due to the unsettled political, economic, civil, and social climate existing in that country. The company had previously ceased accepting applications from residents of Brazil, Central America, and the Pacific Rim region in the fourth quarter of 2015 and from residents in the Eastern European region, primarily Russian-speaking, during 2017. As noted in Note (12) Subsequent Events in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the first quarter filing, the company ceased accepting applications for the company's international products from all remaining foreign residents effective May 11, 2018.

At December 31, 2018, the company had approximately 56,500 international life insurance policies in force representing nearly $15.4 billion in face amount of coverage.

There were some inherent risks of accepting international applications which are not present within the domestic market that were reduced substantially by the company in several ways. As previously described, National Western accepted applications from foreign nationals in upper socioeconomic classes who had substantial financial resources. This targeted customer base coupled with National Western's conservative underwriting practices have historically resulted in claims experience, due to natural causes, similar to that in the United States.  The company has minimized exposure to foreign currency risks by requiring payment of premiums and claims in United States dollars. In addition, the company adopted an extensive anti-money laundering compliance program in order to fully comply with all applicable U.S. anti-money laundering or other illegal activities. All of the above, combined with experience with the international products for over fifty years and the company's longstanding business relationships, further served to minimize risks.
Contracts issued to international residents historically had larger face amounts of life insurance coverage per policy compared to those issued to domestic policyholders. The insurance coverage per international life policy witnessed a steady growth until 2015 when the company ceased accepting applications from residents of several countries. During the same time period, the company's average face amount of insurance coverage per policy for domestic contracts exhibited an upward trend reflecting the shift in sales toward single premium life products. Empirical evidence suggests that policy persistency generally improves with larger face amounts of insurance.

Although many agents sell National Western's products, the company's annuity sales in any year typically reflect several NMOs whose contracted independent agents sold 10% or more of the company’s total annuity sales. In 2018, there were two NMOs that exceeded this threshold accounting for approximately 14% and 13%, respectively, of the company’s annuity sales. Similarly, domestic life insurance sales in any year may include several NMOs who accounted for 10% or more of total domestic life insurance sales. In 2018, there were three NMOs who generated 35%, 10%, and 10%, respectively, of total domestic life insurance sales. Given the independent distribution model National Western employs, the concentration of sales within a particular NMO is not an acute concern as compared to other distribution channels given that the underlying agents are free to contract with the company through any NMO with which the company has a relationship.
The company's international business consisted of applications submitted by independent contractors of Latin America during 2018 and 2017. The company's international life sales during 2018 came principally from residents of Columbia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile. As noted previously, the company ceased accepting applications from all remaining residents outside the U.S. effective May 11, 2018. The company had previously ceased accepting applications for its international products from residents in the Pacific Rim, Central America, and Brazil in 2015; from residents in Eastern Europe in 2017; and from residents of Venezuela in the first quarter of 2018. The progressive disengagements were the result of increasing costs associated with this business and reduced profitability due to higher than anticipated mortality experience, lower than expected persistency of policies, and the additional cost structure imposed. In addition, unsettled political, economic, civil and social climates in places such as Venezuela contributed to the decision to cease accepting applications for international products from residents outside the country.
As disclosed in prior SEC filings, the Brazilian Superintendence of Private Insurance (“SUSEP”) attempted to serve National Western in 2011 with a subpoena regarding an administrative proceeding initiated by SUSEP in which it alleged the company was operating as an insurance company in Brazil without due authorization. While the company believes that SUSEP has no jurisdiction over the company, SUSEP affirmed its imposition of a penal fine against National Western, but in a reduced amount of 3 million reais (approximately $960,000). Given the substantial reduction in the proposed penal fine by SUSEP, National Western paid the penal fine in the reduced amount in the fourth quarter of 2016 under protest and thereby retained its rights to seek judicial review in Brazil of the merits of the SUSEP charges. In light of these developments, the company ceased accepting new applications from residents in Brazil during the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, as noted in the previous paragraph, after careful consideration of various factors, including segment performance and the volume of application submissions, the company ceased accepting applications from residents in certain other countries during that same time period, primarily Central America and the Pacific Rim. Finally, as also noted above, the company ceased accepting applications from all residents outside of the U.S. in May 2018.

Competition and Ratings
National Western operates in a mature and highly competitive industry. We compete with hundreds of life and health insurance company groups in the United States as well as other financial intermediaries such as banks and securities firms who market insurance products. Many of these companies are larger, have more substantial capital and technological resources, possess greater brand recognition, and maintain higher ratings. Competitors in international territories had included Pan-American Life Insurance, American Fidelity Life Insurance, and Best Meridian Insurance while domestic market competitors have included, among others, Allianz Life, American Equity Investment Life, Sammons Financial Group (Midland, NACOLAH), Security Benefit Life, Fidelity and Guaranty Life, Athene USA, Jackson National Life, Equitrust Life Insurance Company, Pacific Life, National Life Group (Life of the Southwest) and Global Atlantic. Competitive factors are primarily the breadth and quality of products offered, established positions in niche markets, pricing, relationships with distribution channels, commission structures, the perceived stability of the insurer, quality of underwriting and customer service, scale and cost efficiency. Operating results of life insurers are subject to fluctuations not only from this competitive environment but also due to economic conditions, interest rate levels and changes, performance of investments, and the maintenance of strong insurance ratings from independent rating agencies.
In order to compete successfully, life insurers focus initiatives toward distribution, technology, defined end market targets, speed to the market in terms of product development, and customer relationship management as ways of gaining a competitive edge. The Company's management believes that it competes primarily on the basis of its longstanding reputation for commitment in serving its markets, its financial strength and stability, and its ability to attract and retain distribution based upon product and compensation.

Ratings with respect to financial strength are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Financial strength ratings are generally defined as a rating agency’s opinion as to a company’s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders and contract holders. Accordingly, ratings are important to maintaining public confidence and impact the ability to market products. The following summarizes National Western's current financial strength ratings.

Rating Agency | Rating | Outlook
A.M. Best | A (Excellent) | Stable 
Standard & Poor's | A- (Strong) | Stable 

A.M. Best has 16 financial strength ratings assigned to insurance companies which currently range from A++ (Superior) to F (In Liquidation). Standard & Poor’s has twenty-one financial strength ratings assigned to insurance companies ranging from “AAA” (Extremely Strong) to “R” (Regulatory Action). Both rating agencies further qualify their current ratings with outlook designations of “Positive”, “Stable”, and “Negative”. During 2018, Standard & Poor's, primarily in response to the company's strategic shift away from accepting applications from residents outside the U.S., reduced the company's rating while maintaining an outlook of "Stable".
A.M. Best and Standard & Poor’s ratings are an independent consideration of National Western’s claims paying ability and are not a rating of the company’s investment worthiness. Accordingly, such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. The rating agencies formally review National Western and its rating on an annual basis with interim analysis performed as necessary. Generally speaking, as ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency, there is no assurance that National Western's ratings will continue for a certain period of time. In the event the company's ratings are subsequently downgraded, the company's business may be negatively impacted.

Risk Management
Similar to other entities, the Company is exposed to a wide spectrum of financial, operational, and other risks as described in Item 1A “Risk Factors”. Effective enterprise risk management ("ERM") is a key concern for identifying, monitoring, measuring, communicating, and managing risks within limits and risk tolerances. The Company’s Board of Directors and senior management are knowledgeable of and accountable for key risks.  The full Board of Directors of the Company (as well as the Board of Directors of National Western) meets at least every other month and regularly hears reports from the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the President and Chief Operating officer (National Western), the Chief Actuary (National Western), the Chief Investment Officer (National Western), and the Chief Legal Officer. In addition, the Board of Directors of the Company (including the Board of Directors of National Western) has several committees which include the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee, the Investment Committee, and the Compensation and Stock Option Committee that regularly convene to address various aspects of risk. Day-to-day responsibility for the overall ERM governance framework resides with the Company's designated Chief Risk Officer.

Lines of Business / Functional Areas 

National Western maintains management groups and committees that meet regularly to monitor, discuss and manage a variety of issues and risks associated with the business. These groups and committees include numerous areas such as regulatory compliance, financial reporting process and controls, fraud unit investigations, product spread management, security (including cyber), and business strategy. Key members of senior management are involved with these groups and committees providing direction and oversight and serve as a reporting liaison with the Company’s Board of Directors and sub-committees. In addition, the Internal Audit department reviews financial and operational risk exposures and reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Company concerning its independent reviews and assessments of management's efforts in these areas.
The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures, including internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly authorized, executed and recorded. The Company recognizes the importance of full and open presentation of its financial position and operating results and to this end maintains a Disclosure Controls and Procedures Committee ("Disclosure Committee") comprised of senior executives who possess comprehensive knowledge of the Company's business and operations.  The Disclosure Committee is responsible for evaluating disclosure controls and procedures and for the gathering, analyzing, and disclosing of information as required to be disclosed under the securities laws.  It assists the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in their responsibilities for making the certifications required under the securities laws regarding the Company's disclosure controls and procedures.  It ensures that material financial information is properly communicated up the Company's hierarchy to the appropriate person or persons and that all disclosures are made in a timely fashion.  This Committee reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Company.

National Western's product designs, underwriting standards and risk management techniques are utilized to protect against disintermediation risk and greater than expected mortality and morbidity risk. Disintermediation risk is limited through the use of surrender charges, certain provisions not allowing discretionary withdrawals, and market value adjustment features. Investment guidelines including duration targets, asset allocation tolerances and return objectives help to ensure that disintermediation risk is managed within the constraints of profitability criteria. Prudent underwriting is applied to select and price insurance risks and management regularly monitors mortality experience relative to its product pricing assumptions. Enforcement of disciplined claims management serves to further protect against greater than expected mortality.
A significant aspect of the company’s business is managing the linkage of its asset characteristics with the anticipated behavior of its policy obligations and liabilities, a process commonly referred to as asset-liability matching. National Western maintains an Asset-Liability Committee (“ALCO”) consisting of senior level members of National Western who assist and advise the Board of Directors in monitoring the level of risk National Western is exposed to in managing its assets and liabilities in order to attain the risk-return profile desired.  Certain members of the ALCO meet as frequently as necessary, to review and recommend for Board of Director ratification, current period interest crediting rates to policyholders based upon existing and anticipated investment opportunities. These rates apply to new sales and to products after an initial guaranteed period, if applicable. Rates are established after the initial guaranteed period based upon asset portfolio yields and each product’s required interest spread, taking into consideration current competitive market conditions.
Underwriters generally follow detailed policies and procedures to assess and quantify the risk of National Western's individual life products based on the age, gender, health, occupation and financial resources of the applicant and the amount of insurance applied for. As National Western maintains reinsurance treaties with several third party reinsurers, the majority of National Western's risk assessment policies have been established in conjunction with reinsurer policies and practices. National Western bases premiums and policy charges for individual life insurance on expected death benefits, surrender benefits, expenses and required reserves. Assumptions regarding mortality, interest rates, policy persistency, expenses, premium payment patterns and investment performance are embedded in the pricing of policies. Deviations of actual experience from pricing assumptions may positively or negatively impact the profitability of National Western's products. 
Substantially all products sold to residents of other countries contained a currency clause stating that premium and claim "dollars" refer to lawful currency of the United States.  Policy applications that had been submitted through international insurance consultants generally were associated with individuals in upper socioeconomic classes who desired the stability and inflationary hedge of dollar denominated insurance products previously issued by National Western.  The favorable demographics of this group typically resulted in an average policy size, persistency, and claims experience (from natural causes) similar to that in the United States.  By having accepted applications submitted on residents outside the United States, National Western was able to further diversify its revenue, earnings and insurance risk.
Insurance Product Liabilities
At December 31, 2018, the Company's total balance for liabilities pertaining to insurance products was $9.9 billion. These product liabilities are payable over an extended period of time for which National Western's product pricing includes in making certain assumptions. The profitability of insurance products depends on this pricing and differences between the company's expectations when the products are sold and the subsequent actual experience impacts future profitability.
Liabilities for insurance products are determined using standard actuarial tables and past experience. Accordingly, establishing reserves can be an uncertain process in some cases. The Company's financial results depend significantly upon the extent to which actual experience is consistent with the assumptions used in determining reserves and pricing National Western's products. If assumptions are incorrect with respect to future claims, future policyholder premiums and policy charges or the investment income derived from the assets supporting product liabilities, the Company would be required to increase its liabilities which would negatively affect operating results.

Reinsurance
National Western follows the industry practice of reinsuring (ceding) portions of its insurance risks with a variety of reinsurance companies. All reinsurance is yearly renewable term. The company does not use financial or surplus relief reinsurance. The use of reinsurance allows the company to underwrite policies larger than the risk it is willing to retain on any single life and to continue writing a larger volume of new business. New sales of life insurance products are reinsured above prescribed limits and do not require the reinsurer’s prior approval within certain guidelines. The maximum amount of life insurance the company normally retains is $500,000 on any one life. However, the use of reinsurance does not relieve National Western of its primary liability to pay the full amount of the insurance benefit in the event of the failure of a reinsurer to honor its contractual obligation. Consequently, the company avoids concentrating reinsurance risk with any one reinsurer and only participates in reinsurance treaties with reputable carriers. No reinsurer of business ceded by National Western has failed to pay policy claims (individually or in the aggregate) with respect to our ceded business. The company continuously monitors the financial strength of its reinsurers and has been able to obtain replacement coverages from financially responsible reinsurers when making changes. The company’s primary reinsurers as of December 31, 2018 were as follows.

Regulatory and Other Issues
Regulation. The Company's insurance business is subject to comprehensive state regulation in each of the states it is licensed to conduct business. The laws enforced by the various state insurance departments provide broad administrative powers with respect to licensing to transact business, licensing and appointing agents, approving policy forms, regulating unfair trade and claims practices, establishing solvency standards, fixing minimum interest rates for the accumulation of surrender values, and regulating the type, amounts, and valuations of permitted investments, among other things. National Western is required to file detailed annual statements with each of the state insurance supervisory departments in which it does business. Annually, the company’s board-appointed qualified actuary must submit an opinion to state insurance regulators where the company is licensed to do business on whether the statutory assets held backing the statutory reserves are sufficient to meet contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurer. If an opinion cannot be rendered noting the sufficiency of assets, the company is required to establish additional statutory reserves which draw from available statutory surplus until the time such an opinion can be furnished.
National Western's operations and financial records are subject to examination by these departments typically at regular intervals but may be examined at any time. Statutory financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Colorado Division of Insurance, the company's principal insurance regulator. Prescribed statutory accounting practices are largely dictated by the Statutory Accounting Principles adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"). The company's most recent Colorado statutory financial examination covered the five year period ended December 31, 2012, and resulted in no financial statement adjustments and no material deficiencies were found. An examination for the five year period ended December 31, 2017 by the Colorado department commenced during the latter half of 2018 and is still in progress as of the date of this filing. The NAIC, as well as state regulators, continually evaluates existing laws and regulations pertaining to the operations of life insurers. To the extent that initiatives result as a part of this process, they may be adopted in the various states in which the company is licensed to do business. It is not possible to predict the ultimate content and timing of new statutes and regulations adopted by state insurance departments and the related impact upon the company's operations although it is conceivable that they may be more restrictive.

The NAIC has developed a principles-based approach for establishing reserves for life insurance products. This approach is designed to improve reserving for products for which the current formula requirement for reserves may not accurately reflect the risks or costs of the obligations to insurers. The NAIC's Standard Valuation Law has been enacted by the minimum number of states representing a minimum level of premium volume needed in order for the principles-based approach to become effective. This approach is effective as of January 1, 2017 with a three year phase-in period and is prospective (applying only to new business). National Western fully intends to be compliant with the new Standard Valuation Law by the end of the phase-in period.
The NAIC has also enacted the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ("ORSA") model act which requires insurers to make a formal assessment of the adequacy of their risk management and current and future solvency positions. National Western's state of domicile, Colorado, passed legislation calling for the adoption of the ORSA Model Act which subjected the company to filing annual ORSA reports with the Colorado Division of Insurance starting in 2017. The company filed its annual ORSA report in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Each state has insurance guaranty association laws under which insurers doing business in a state can be assessed contributions, up to prescribed limits, in order to cover contractual benefit obligations of insolvent insurance companies. The state guaranty associations levy assessments on each insurer on the basis of their proportionate share of the premiums written in the lines of business in which the insolvent insurer had been engaged. Some states permit the member insurers to recover the assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets.
National Western is also subject to the laws and regulations of states and other jurisdictions concerning the identification, reporting, and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned funds. Compliance with these requirements is subject to audit and examination by state regulators. 
State insurance laws and regulations contain numerous provisions pertaining to the marketplace activities of insurers, including various provisions governing the form and content of disclosures made to consumers, policy illustrations, advertising material, sales practices and handling of policyholder complaints. State regulatory authorities enforce these prerequisites through periodic market conduct examinations.
Given the ongoing legislative developments concerning insurance industry regulation, the NAIC and state regulators continue to revisit existing laws and statutes focusing on matters involving insurance company investments and solvency, market conduct, risk-adjusted capital measurements, enterprise risk management guidelines, interpretations of current laws, and creation of new laws. The Company does not believe the adoption of any of the current NAIC initiatives will have a material adverse impact on its operations; however, the Company cannot predict the form of any future proposals or regulation.
The Company’s business is also affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws. Although the federal government does not directly regulate the life insurance industry, federal measures previously considered or enacted by Congress, if revisited, could affect the insurance industry and the Company's business. These measures include the tax treatment of life insurance companies and life insurance products, as well as changes in individual income tax structures and rates. Even though the ultimate impact of any of these changes, if implemented, is uncertain, the persistency of National Western's existing products and the ability to sell products could be materially affected. 
The Company is subject to federal and state laws and regulations that require financial institutions and other businesses to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information, including health-related and customer information, and to notify their customers and other individuals of their policies and practices relating to the collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information. Federal or state laws or regulations also provide additional protections regarding the use and disclosure of certain information such as social security numbers; require notice to affected individuals, regulators, and others if there is a breach of the security of certain personal information; require financial institutions to implement effective programs to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft; and prescribe the permissible uses of certain financial information, including customer information and consumer report information.
Despite having been in place for several years, many of the key rules of the Dodd-Frank legislation have yet to be formalized, some of which may have an impact on insurers. The Federal Insurance Office ("FIO") was established to accumulate information about the insurance industry and its mandate is very broad although it is not empowered with any general regulatory authority over insurers. The current Presidential Administration continues to review this legislation and may roll back more of the rules and regulatory authority embedded in Dodd-Frank.

The USA Patriot Act of 2001 ("Patriot Act") amended the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 and the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 to expand anti-money laundering ("AML") and financial transparency laws applicable to financial services companies, including insurance companies. Among other things, the Patriot Act seeks to identify parties involved in terrorism, money laundering or other illegal activities. It is the policy of National Western to comply fully with all applicable U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations. The company is committed to maintaining company-wide awareness of the importance of these laws and regulations and has adopted an AML Compliance Program, setting forth National Western’s policies, procedures, and internal controls designed to detect and prevent money laundering.  The goal of this Program is to establish a framework for the company to ensure compliance with all applicable U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including not only the Patriot Act but also the sanctions programs promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
Risk-Based Capital Requirements. In order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the NAIC established risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements to help state regulators monitor the financial strength and stability of life insurers by identifying those companies that may be inadequately capitalized. Under the NAIC's requirements, each insurer must maintain its total capital above a calculated threshold or take corrective measures to achieve the threshold.  The threshold of adequate capital is based on a formula that takes into account the amount of risk each company faces on its products and investments.  The RBC formula takes into consideration four major areas of risk which are: (i) asset risk which primarily focuses on the quality of investments; (ii) insurance risk which encompasses mortality and morbidity risk; (iii) interest rate risk which involves asset-liability matching issues; and (iv) other business risks.  For each category, the RBC requirements are determined by applying specified factors to various assets, premiums, reserves, and other items, with the factor being higher for items with greater underlying risk and lower for items with less risk. The standards require life insurers to submit a report to state regulators on an annual basis regarding their risk-based capital. 
The RBC requirements provide for four levels of regulatory attention, varying with the ratio of the insurer's ratio of total adjusted capital to its RBC as measured on December 31 of each year. In addition, the RBC requirements provide for a trend test if an insurer's total adjusted capital falls to a certain range of its ratio relative to its RBC as of the end of the year. National Western's statutory capital and surplus at December 31, 2018, was significantly in excess of the threshold RBC requirements for regulatory attention and trend test analysis.
Effects of Inflation. The rate of inflation as measured by the change in the average consumer price index has not had a material effect on the revenues or operating results of the Company during the three most recent fiscal years.
Employees.  National Western had 276 employees as of December 31, 2018, substantially all of which worked in the company’s home office in Austin, Texas. None of the employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with the company.
