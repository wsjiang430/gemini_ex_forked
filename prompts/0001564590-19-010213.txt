ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
---------+---------

Overview 
 Strategic Student & Senior Housing Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was formed on October 4, 2016 under the Maryland General Corporation Law for the purpose of engaging in the business of investing in student housing and senior housing real estate investments. The Company’s year-end is December 31. As used in these consolidated financial statements, “we,” “us,” “our,” and “Company” refer to Strategic Student & Senior Housing Trust, Inc. and each of our subsidiaries. 
 On October 4, 2016, our Advisor, as defined below, acquired 111.11 shares of our common stock for $1,000 and became our initial stockholder. On January 27, 2017, pursuant to a confidential private placement memorandum (the “private placement memorandum”), we commenced a private offering of up to $100,000,000 in shares of our common stock (the “Primary Private Offering”) and 1,000,000 shares of common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (collectively, the “Private Offering” and together with the Public Offering, the “Offerings”). The Private Offering required a minimum offering amount of $1,000,000. On August 4, 2017, we met such minimum offering requirement. Our Primary Private Offering terminated on March 15, 2018. We raised offering proceeds of approximately $93 million from the issuance of approximately 10.8 million shares pursuant to the Private Offering.
 On May 1, 2018, our registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-220646) (the “Registration Statement”) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Registration Statement registered up to $1.0 billion in shares of common stock for sale to the public (the “Primary Offering”) consisting of three classes of shares - Class A shares for $10.33 per share (up to $450 million in shares), Class T shares for $10.00 per share (up to $450 million in shares), and Class W shares for $9.40 per share (up to $100 million in shares) - and up to $95,000,000 in shares of common stock for sale pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (together with the Primary Offering, the “Public Offering”) at $9.81 per share for Class A shares, $9.50 per share for Class T shares and $9.40 per share for Class W shares.
 Concurrently with our Registration Statement being declared effective, we filed articles of amendment to our charter (the “Articles of Amendment”) and articles supplementary to our charter (the “Articles Supplementary”). As a result of filing the Articles of Amendment and the Articles Supplementary, all shares issued in our Private Offering were redesignated as Class A shares and the remaining shares were reclassified such that we now have 315,000,000 shares classified as Class A shares, 315,000,000 shares classified as Class T shares and 70,000,000 shares classified as Class W shares. As of December 31, 2018, we had sold approximately 126,000 Class A shares, approximately 36,000 Class T shares, and approximately 44,000 Class W shares for gross offering proceeds of approximately $2.0 million in our Primary Public Offering.    While we were formed in October 2016, no formal operations commenced until our first property acquisition, which occurred on June 28, 2017, with our property in Fayetteville, Arkansas (the “Fayetteville Property”).  Accordingly, we had no revenues or expenses prior thereto. We intend to invest the net proceeds from our Primary Offering primarily in income-producing student housing and senior housing properties and related real estate investments located in the United States. We may also purchase growth-oriented student housing and senior housing real estate assets. As of December 31, 2018 we owned (i) two student housing properties, (ii) four senior housing properties, (iii) an approximately 2.6% beneficial interest in Reno Student Housing, DST, a Delaware Statutory Trust (DST) that owns another student housing property (“Reno Student Housing”), and (iv) an approximately 1.4% beneficial interest in Power 5 Conference Student Housing I, DST, a DST that owns two student housing properties (“Power 5 Conference Student Housing”). 
 Our operating partnership, SSSHT Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (our “Operating Partnership”), was formed on October 5, 2016. On October 5, 2016, our Advisor agreed to acquire a limited partnership interest in our Operating Partnership for $1,000 (111.11 partnership units) and we agreed to contribute the initial $1,000 capital contribution to our Operating Partnership in exchange for the general partner interest. In addition, on September 28, 2017, our Advisor acquired additional limited partnership interests (25,447.57 partnership units) in our Operating Partnership for $199,000, resulting in total capital contributions of $200,000 by our Advisor in our Operating Partnership. Our Operating Partnership owns, directly or indirectly through one or more special purpose entities, all of the student housing and senior housing properties that we acquire. As of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 99.8% of the common units of limited partnership interest of our Operating Partnership. The remaining approximately 0.2% of the common units are owned by our Advisor. In addition, an affiliate of our Sponsor owns all of the preferred units in our Operating Partnership. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding the preferred units in our Operating Partnership.

We conduct certain activities directly or indirectly through our taxable REIT subsidiary, SSSHT TRS, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “TRS”) which was formed on October 6, 2016, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of our Operating Partnership. 
 SmartStop Asset Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company organized in 2013 (our “Sponsor”), is the sponsor of our Public Offering. Our Sponsor is a company focused on providing real estate advisory, asset management, and property management services. Our Sponsor owns 97.5% of the economic interests (and 100% of the voting membership interests) of our Advisor and owns 100% of our affiliated Property Manager, each as defined below. 
 We have no employees. Our advisor is SSSHT Advisor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (our “Advisor”) which was formed on October 3, 2016. Our Advisor is responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and identifying and making acquisitions and investments on our behalf under the terms of an advisory agreement we entered into with our Advisor on January 27, 2017 (our “Private Offering Advisory Agreement”) which, in connection with our Public Offering, we amended and restated on May 1, 2018 and further amended on September 6, 2018 (as amended, our “Advisory Agreement”). The majority of the officers of our Advisor are also officers of us and our Sponsor. 
 SSSHT Property Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (our “Property Manager”), was formed on October 3, 2016. Our Property Manager derives substantially all of its income from the property management oversight services it performs for us. We expect that we will enter into property management agreements directly with third party property managers and that our affiliated Property Manager will provide oversight services with respect to such third party property managers.  
 The Fayetteville Property and our property in Tallahassee, Florida (the “Tallahassee Property”) are managed by Asset Campus Housing (“ACH”), a third-party student housing property manager. Three of our senior housing properties are managed by MSL Community Management LLC, an affiliate of MBK Senior Living LLC (“MBK”). Our fourth senior housing property is managed by Integral Senior Living, LLC (“ISL”). 
 Our dealer manager is Select Capital Corporation, a California corporation (our “Dealer Manager”). On January 27, 2017, we executed a dealer manager agreement (as amended, the “Private Offering Dealer Manager Agreement”) with our Dealer Manager with respect to the Private Offering. The Private Offering Dealer Manager Agreement terminated at the closing of our Private Offering. We executed a similar dealer manager agreement (the “Dealer Manager Agreement”) with our Dealer Manager with respect to the Public Offering on May 1, 2018. Our Dealer Manager was responsible for marketing our shares offered pursuant to our Primary Private Offering and is now similarly responsible for our Primary Offering. Our Sponsor owns, through a wholly-owned limited liability company, a 15% non-voting equity interest in our Dealer Manager. Affiliates of our Dealer Manager own a 2.5% non-voting membership interest in our Advisor, which they acquired on January 1, 2018. 
 Our Sponsor owns 100% of the membership interests of Strategic Transfer Agent Services, LLC, our transfer agent (our “Transfer Agent”). On May 1, 2018, we executed a transfer agent agreement (the “Transfer Agent Agreement”), with our Transfer Agent. Our Transfer Agent provides transfer agent and registrar services to us that are substantially similar to what a third party transfer agent would provide in the ordinary course of performing its functions as a transfer agent. Our Transfer Agent may retain and supervise third party vendors in its efforts to administer certain services. Prior to May 1, 2018, our Advisor processed subscription agreements and provided other stockholder and investor relations services on our behalf.
 As we accept subscriptions for shares of our common stock, we transfer all of the net offering proceeds to our Operating Partnership as capital contributions in exchange for additional units of interest in our Operating Partnership. However, we will be deemed to have made capital contributions in the amount of gross proceeds received from investors, and our Operating Partnership will be deemed to have simultaneously paid the sales commissions and other costs associated with the Offering. In addition, our Operating Partnership is structured to make distributions with respect to limited partnership units that are equivalent to the distributions we make to stockholders. Finally, a limited partner in our Operating Partnership may later exchange his or her limited partnership units in our Operating Partnership for shares of our common stock at any time after one year following the date of issuance of their limited partnership units, subject to certain restrictions outlined in the limited partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership (the “Operating Partnership Agreement”). Our Advisor is prohibited from exchanging or otherwise transferring its limited partnership units so long as it is acting as our Advisor pursuant to our Advisory Agreement.

Business Overview 
 We develop, acquire, and own student housing and senior housing properties. We do not directly manage or operate any of our properties. Rather, we rely on third party property managers and senior living operators for such responsibilities. In addition, our affiliated property manager provides oversight services with respect to such third party property managers and senior living operators. As we grow our portfolio of student housing and senior housing properties, we expect to be able to consolidate and streamline a number of aspects of our operations through economies of scale. To the extent we can acquire properties in clusters within geographic regions, we may see property management efficiencies resulting in reduction of personnel and other administrative costs.
Industries Summary 
 The Student Housing Industry 
 Student housing is broadly defined to include housing designed to accommodate students enrolled in either full-time or part-time post-secondary, public, and private four-year colleges and universities, including those that offer advanced degrees. The student housing market generally does not seek to address the housing needs of students enrolled in two-year community colleges and technical colleges, as these institutions do not generate sufficient and consistent demand for student housing. The number of prospective college students is increasing through the first quarter of this century despite minor declines in the post-recession era. This increase, coupled with the trend towards college as the interim step between high school and entering the job market, indicates that most colleges and universities will continue to face pressure to respond to burgeoning enrollment with ample student housing. 
 The student housing market is a specialized segment of the residential real estate market. The residential real estate market is comprised of single-family and multi-family products. The single-family market is primarily a for-sale market, although single family dwellings can also be offered for rent, particularly as housing market conditions deteriorate and the ability to sell houses declines. The multi-family market can be divided into the for-sale market (i.e., condominiums) and the for-rent market (i.e., conventional apartments), with the latter category generally considered as a crossover with commercial real estate, in that such properties are constructed as income-generating properties, similar to retail, office, or industrial properties. Both single-family for-rent and multi-family apartments compete directly with student housing. 
 Overall, the student housing market has certain unique characteristics that distinguish it from other segments of the housing market. First, purpose-built student housing is aimed only at those persons enrolled in college and not at the general population of renters. Second, the leasing cycle for student housing properties is defined by the academic calendar, which results in a finite leasing window and relatively low month-to-month turnover following the start of the academic year. Finally, student housing properties are designed to accommodate and appeal to the college lifestyle, which is significantly different from the lifestyle of a typical multi-family renter. 
 There are two general types of student housing: (i) on campus and (ii) off-campus. On-campus housing is generally owned and operated by educational institutions or in a joint venture via public or private partnerships, and is located on school property near or adjacent to classroom buildings and other campus facilities. On campus student housing is typically a dormitory with dining halls designed for first year students or for graduate students. Off-campus housing is generally owned and operated by private investors and is located in close proximity to campus (i.e., generally within a two-mile radius of the campus). There are three types of off-campus student housing properties: (i) student competitive, (ii) conventional market rate and (iii) purpose-built. Similar to other real estate products, location plays an important role in student housing. The best off-campus sites are those within walking distance to a campus and those located on college sponsored shuttle or mass-transit lines. Student competitive apartments are traditional apartment projects that happen to be close to campus. Market rate apartments are typically properties within driving distance, occupied by students who choose to commute. Even the best amenities will not compensate for an inferior location. A poorly-located property with a superior amenity package may initially be market acceptable, but the tenancy usually declines after the inconvenience becomes evident. A means to partially mitigate this issue of distance is to ensure adequate on-site parking. Many students have automobiles, especially in the more suburban locales where mass-transit is less frequent. These locations tend to be the likely locations for privately operated off-campus housing.

Purpose-built student housing refers to off-campus housing that is specifically designed and constructed as an amenities-rich property with a view towards accommodating the unique characteristics of the student-resident. While purpose-built student housing is classified as a multi-family housing product, it is significantly different from and more specialized than traditional market rate multi-family housing products, which are offered to the broader pool of multi-family renters. Key features of purpose-built student housing that differentiate such properties from traditional multi-family apartments include: 
  
• | rent “by the bed” lease terms and rental rates (as opposed to “by the unit” apartment leases);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | bed/bath parity offering enhanced privacy;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | fully furnished units;
--+-----------------------


• | in some markets, bundled pricing, which may include utilities, cable and Internet;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enhanced security features, including keyed bedroom locks, gated entrances and security cameras;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | resort-style amenities (e.g., oversized pools, clubhouses with fitness centers and game lounges, etc.);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | condominium-like interior finishes; and
--+----------------------------------------


• | very fast and reliable Internet connectivity.
--+----------------------------------------------

 Unlike multi-family housing where apartments are leased by the unit, student housing properties are typically leased by the bed on an individual lease liability basis. Individual lease liability can limit each resident’s liability to his or her own rent without liability for a roommate’s rent. A parent or guardian will be required to execute each lease as a guarantor unless the resident provides adequate proof of income. The number of lease contracts that we administer will therefore be equivalent to the number of beds occupied instead of the number of apartment units rented. 
 By investing in newer construction, purpose-built and amenities rich student housing communities that are walking distance to campus, we believe our properties will typically command higher per-unit and per-square foot rental rates than most student competitive or market rate multifamily properties in the same geographic markets. We also believe that we will typically be able to command higher resale values as properties that are closer to campus tend to have lower cap rates. 
 The traditional dormitory experience of communal bathrooms and bunk beds is being challenged by community-based concepts. The community-based living arrangement focuses on socialization and recreation and access to fast and reliable Internet connectivity. Unit features like private bedrooms with bathrooms, cable television, dedicated high-speed Internet access, and fiber-optic connectivity to the institution’s services along with substantial on-site amenities are items being touted by student housing developers. Common elements in the unit usually include full kitchens with microwave ovens, dishwashers/disposals, and full refrigerators. Increasingly, units have access to storage areas and in-unit washers/dryers — all the comforts of home. A 2013 survey of 7,095 graduate and undergraduate students prepared for Multifamily Executive, a magazine that provides apartment and condo industry news, multifamily design ideas and apartment technology information, found that communal spaces such as fitness centers, study rooms, computer labs, coffee bars, and entertainment centers are also preferred by students. Most higher-education on-campus residence halls were built over 30 years ago, and student expectations have changed dramatically in terms of privacy and amenity requirements. We believe students in today’s market are becoming accustomed to, and are demanding, a living standard similar to and exceeding that experienced at home. For many students and their parents, housing that does not address certain unit features/amenities is simply unacceptable. 
 Student housing is a niche property type that has its own set of inherent issues, which are usually addressed by proactive property management. Student housing is seasonal. The most common way to smooth out seasonality is by writing 12 month leases as opposed to leases tied to school year periods. While this lease structure assists in stabilizing annual cash flow, the vast majority of beds still turn over at the same time at the end of the school year. This is followed by a short window of time to address and complete maintenance before the next school cycle. Leasing for the upcoming academic year typically commences in the first semester with a “push” for renewals through December 31 and then marketing to new students at the beginning of the year and ending by late August. Failure to lease-up or correct deferred maintenance during this leasing period can be costly to the property with an entire year’s tenancy and cash flow in jeopardy. We anticipate that substantially all of our leases will commence in August and terminate on the last day of July. These dates coincide with the commencement of the universities’ fall academic term and typically terminate at the completion of the subsequent summer school session. Other than renewing student-residents, we will be required to substantially re-lease each property each year, resulting in significant turnover in our student-resident population from year to year.

With college and university enrollment steadily growing across the U.S. in recent years, there is a significant need for safe, affordable, and accessible student housing at both public and private institutions. Not all of this housing can be on-campus and institution-financed. Institutions are now evaluating the merits of internal financing, either through use of their endowment or issuance of general obligation bonds or joint venture using a public or private partnership program. While institutions evaluate the market, opportunities exist for off campus private development and financing of student housing. The bureaucratic constraints on public institutions can afford private developers an additional advantage. 
 The Senior Housing Industry 
 Broadly defined, congregate care senior housing refers to the aggregate of active adult and age-restricted communities, independent living communities, assisted living communities, memory care facilities, continuing care retirement communities and other properties that focus on providing housing to seniors. The senior housing market is a specialized segment of the residential real estate market and has certain unique characteristics that distinguish it from other segments of the housing market. 
 Active adult and age-restricted communities are senior communities for residents that generally do not require any level of special care or services. Seniors in these communities seek to live amongst others in a similar stage of life and enjoy the highest levels of activity and full independence. These communities are generally not subject to any special laws or regulations, beyond those customarily in-place for planned communities, such as a restriction on the minimum age of residents.
 Independent living communities provide high levels of privacy and social interaction to residents and require residents to be capable of relatively high levels of independence. An independent living community typically bundles several services as part of a regular monthly charge. Services included in the base charge may include two to three meals per day in a community dining room, semi-monthly housekeeping services, transportation shuttle and organized social activities and emergency call systems. Additional services are generally available from staff employees on a fee for service basis. Some majority independent living communities dedicate separate parts of the property to assisted living and/or memory care services. 
 Assisted living communities typically have mostly one bedroom units that include private bathrooms and efficiency kitchens. The base monthly charge for residents typically includes three meals per day in the community dining room, daily or weekly housekeeping, laundry, medical reminders and 24 hour availability of assistance with the activities of daily living, such as dressing and bathing. Professional nursing and healthcare services are usually available at the property on call or at regularly scheduled times. 
 Memory care facilities generally provide extensive nursing care that specifically caters to patients with Alzheimer’s disease, dementia and other types of memory problems. Typical memory care units have secured access and include mostly rooms with one or two beds, a separate bathroom and shared dining facilities. These types of facilities are staffed by licensed nursing professionals 24 hours per day. 
 Continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs, provide housing and health-related services under long-term contracts. Residents enter these communities while still relatively healthy and pay an entry fee and adjustable monthly rent in return for the guarantee of care for the rest of their life. CCRCs are appealing to residents as they eliminate the need for relocating when health and medical needs change, thus allowing residents to “age in place.” 
 The growth in total demand for senior housing comes from broad U.S. demographic changes, demand for need-driven services, increased healthcare spending, new construction of senior living communities, fragmented senior housing ownership, asymmetric investment returns and preferences towards more private pay, amenities-rich environments. These factors, in turn, are resulting in changes to senior housing ownership, as further discussed below. 
 Demographic Trends. We believe owners and operators of senior housing facilities and other healthcare real estate will benefit from demographic trends, specifically the aging of the U.S. population. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the total number of Americans aged 65 and older (a demographic group that tends to need substantial medical services) is expected to increase over four times faster than the rate of the overall U.S. population from approximately 47.8 million in 2015 to approximately 79.2 million by 2035, as the baby boomer generation ages and life expectancies lengthen.

Demand for Need-Driven Services. Demand for healthcare facilities is driven not only by the growing elderly population, which is generally defined as ages 65 and older, but also by the increasing variety of services and level of support required by residents. Senior housing facilities provide varying levels of care as seniors progressively become more dependent on third party care providers and their health conditions deteriorate. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the percentage of older Americans between ages 75 to 79 seeking assistance with activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, such as bathing, walking, medication administration, eating and others, is approximately 15%. Over the age of 80, this percentage increases to almost 30%. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, nearly one third of all individuals 85 years old and older have Alzheimer’s disease. Many of these individuals will require care outside the scope available in their private homes. 
 Increased National Healthcare Expenditures. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, national healthcare expenditures are projected to grow on average 5.6% annually from 2016-2025 and accounted for approximately 17.8% of the U.S. gross domestic product, or GDP, in 2015 and overall healthcare spending is expected to rise to nearly 20% of GDP by 2025. The trend for increasing healthcare costs may also be accelerated by The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), which is expected to increase the number of Americans with healthcare insurance. 
 New Construction for Senior Housing Peaked in 2015. According to NIC MAP© Data Service, new supply of private-pay senior housing construction peaked in 2015 at 49,000 units, representing 5.8% of existing inventory. About half of these 49,000 units were to be delivered in 2015 and the remaining half in 2016. Although elevated compared to recent years, this new development is well below 1990s construction starts. U.S. Census data suggests that the demand for senior housing is sufficient to accommodate current levels of construction because the age 75 and older population is expected to grow 2.9% annually between 2016 and 2020, while supply is expected to grow only 2.6%. We expect demand for senior housing facilities to remain above what the current and near-term senior supply can accommodate, and a tightening construction lending environment should mitigate the growth of new supply and create a favorable market dynamic for the foreseeable future. 
 Fragmented Senior Housing Market. According to data provided by the American Senior Housing Association, there is a high degree of fragmentation among both senior housing owners and operators. The number of units owned by the top 50 senior housing owners account for approximately one-third of the total supply of senior housing properties. On average, the number of units owned by the top 50 senior housing owners is approximately 12,040 units per owner, compared to an average of approximately 36,667 units per owner for the top 10 senior housing owners. Finally, approximately 30% of the top 50 senior housing owners are publicly traded companies. This data suggests minimal industry consolidation and a high percentage of smaller owners and operators controlling their respective markets. In addition, by associating ourselves with recognized and respected healthcare operators, we also believe that an opportunity exists to participate in the consolidation of this fragmented market through the growth of our portfolio. 
 Benefit from the Strong Performance of the Senior Housing Sector. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries, along with NIC MAP© Data Service, published a total real estate investment return matrix for senior housing as compared to apartments, hotels, industrial, retail and office investment properties. For each of the last one, three, five and ten year time periods, senior housing, as an asset class, outperformed all of the aforementioned asset classes by 50%. For the last 10 years, the internal rate of return on senior housing was 12%, as compared to an 8% average for all other asset classes. 
 Senior housing investment real estate will continue to benefit from aging baby boomers, decreasing supply of new construction, increased life expectancy, a steady housing market, innovative design and technology, and top-tier owners and operators that will allow their senior residents to be relevant, stay connected and engaged and know they are receiving the best value for their hard-earned dollar.

Investment Objectives 
 Overview
We have invested and will continue to invest a substantial amount of the net proceeds of our Public and Private Offerings in income-producing student housing and senior housing properties and related real estate investments. However, we may also invest in student and senior housing properties and related real estate investments with growth potential (i.e., properties that require development, redevelopment, lease-up, or repositioning in order to increase the value of such properties). Currently there is no limitation on the number, size or type of properties that we may acquire or on the percentage of net offering proceeds that may be invested in any particular property type or single property. Our investment objectives, strategy, and policies may be amended or changed at any time by our board of directors. Although we have no plans at this time to change any of our investment objectives, our board of directors may change any and all of such investment objectives, including our focus on student housing and senior housing properties, if our board of directors believes such changes are in the best interests of our stockholders. In addition, we may invest in mortgage loans and other real estate-related investments if our board of directors deems such investments to be in the best interests of our stockholders. We cannot assure our stockholders that our policies or investment objectives will be attained or that the value of our common stock will not decrease. 
 Primary Investment Objectives
Our primary investment objectives are to: 
  
• | invest in income-producing student housing and senior housing properties in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preserve and protect our stockholders’ invested capital;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | achieve appreciation in the value of our properties and, hence, appreciation in stockholder value over the long term.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We cannot assure our stockholders that we will attain these primary investment objectives.
 Liquidity Events
Subject to then-existing market conditions and the sole discretion of our board of directors, we intend to seek one or more of the following liquidity events within three to five years after completion of the Public Offering: 

• | merge, reorganize, or otherwise transfer our company or its assets to another entity with listed securities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | spin off one or more of our holding companies (formed to separately hold our student housing and senior housing properties) into a separate company;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | list our shares on a national securities exchange;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | commence the sale of all of our properties and/or our holding companies and liquidate our company; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | otherwise create a liquidity event for our stockholders.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 However, we cannot assure our stockholders that we will achieve one or more of the above-described liquidity events within the time frame contemplated or at all. This time frame represents our best faith estimate of the time necessary to build a portfolio sufficient enough to effectuate one of the liquidity events listed above. Our charter does not provide a date for termination of our corporate existence and does not require us to pursue a liquidity transaction at any time. Our board of directors has the sole discretion to continue operations beyond five years after completion of our Offering if it deems such continuation to be in the best interests of our stockholders. Even if we do accomplish one or more of these liquidity events, we cannot guarantee that a public market will develop for the securities listed or that such securities will trade at a price higher than what was paid for shares in our Offerings. At the time it becomes necessary for our board of directors to determine which liquidity event, if any, is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, we expect that the board of directors will take all relevant factors at that time into consideration when making a liquidity event decision. We expect that the board of directors will consider various factors including, but not limited to, costs and expenses related to each possible liquidity event and the potential subordinated distributions payable to our Advisor.

Investment Strategies 
Student Housing Investment Strategy 
 We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds we raise in our Offerings to primarily invest in existing Class “A” income-producing student housing properties and related student housing real estate investments that are generally amenities rich, newer construction and located adjacent to or within a one mile radius of campus. In order to implement our investment strategy, we will focus on acquiring existing Class “A” income-producing student housing properties located off-campus with the possibility of expanding or repositioning the property if needed. Class “A” properties generally refer to purpose-built or substantially renovated properties constructed within the last 10 to 20 years that are amenities rich and located in favorable demographic markets with high barriers to entry. Such properties tend to be managed by a reputable student housing property management firm. We intend to primarily target medium- to large-sized colleges and established university markets, which we define as markets located in or near U.S. cities that have schools generally with overall enrollment of approximately 15,000 to 40,000 students or greater. We believe some of these markets are both supply constrained and are generally experiencing steady enrollment growth. In addition, our specific university focus will tend toward “Tier 1” schools with established Division I (FBS) football programs. We define “Tier 1” to be universities with a published numerical ranking on the U.S. News & World Report’s most recent Best Colleges—National University Rankings. 
 We intend to grow by selectively acquiring existing Class “A” student housing properties from third parties. If an opportunity exists to expand or reposition an existing Class “A” student housing property, we will do so selectively. Generally, we anticipate that any properties acquired from third parties would meet our investment criteria and fit into our overall strategy in terms of property quality, proximity to campus, bed-bath parity, amenities package, and return on investment. Our intention is to acquire stabilized properties and maintain them in first class condition, ensuring a higher residual value at sale. However, we may also seek to make opportunistic acquisitions of properties that we believe we can purchase at attractive pricing, reposition, grow rents and operate successfully. We may consider the following property and market factors, among others, to identify potential student housing property acquisitions: 
  
• | campus academic and athletic reputation and historical enrollment;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | competitive admissions criteria and tuition costs;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | existing and projected supply of on-campus and off-campus student housing beds;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | distance of property from campus;
--+----------------------------------


• | property unit mix, including enhanced privacy units with a high bed/bath parity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | competition and market rental rates;
--+-------------------------------------


• | significant out-of-state enrollment, including international students;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating performance, including the ability to manage expenses and grow rents;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential for improved management, including an active marketing plan for renewals;

Senior Housing Investment Strategy 
 We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds we raise in our Offering to primarily invest in Class “A” income-producing senior housing properties and related senior housing real estate investments. Class “A” properties generally refer to purpose-built or substantially renovated properties constructed within the last 10 to 20 years that are amenities rich and located in favorable demographic markets with high barriers to entry. Such properties tend to be managed by a reputable operator and located within close proximity to medical and retail support services. In order to implement our investment strategy, we will focus on acquiring, repositioning and/or expanding existing income-producing senior housing properties that have an emphasis on private pay sources of revenue, which properties are considered more stable and predictable than those relying on government reimbursements. 
 9


We intend to selectively acquire senior housing properties from third parties. Generally, we anticipate that any properties acquired from third parties would meet our investment criteria and fit into our overall strategy in terms of property quality, availability of amenities, regional demographics, access and proximity to healthcare services, educational facilities, retail, entertainment and recreational venues, and return on investment. However, we may also seek to make value-add acquisitions of Class “A” properties that we believe we can purchase at attractive pricing due to poor existing operations management, reposition the property in the local community, and replace with a new operator with significant senior housing management services experience. We may consider the following property and market factors, among others, to identify potential senior housing property acquisitions: 
  
• | regional market demographics, psychographics and penetration rates;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | occupied properties with variable acuity levels, such as active adult and age restricted, independent living, assisted living and memory care;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | resident payor mix;
--+--------------------


• | competition, including market rents and unit mixes;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | construction of new senior housing supply by acuity levels;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating performance, including dining, housekeeping, transportation and medical staffing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | governmental regulations and licensing;
--+----------------------------------------


• | proximity to hospitals and other medical services;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | potential for improved management;
--+-----------------------------------


• | ownership and capital structure;
--+---------------------------------


• | presence of desired amenities, including dining services, fitness facilities and social programming; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintenance of the property.
--+-----------------------------

 Senior housing refers to a broad spectrum of housing for seniors with product types that range from “mostly housing” (e.g., active adult and age restricted communities) to “mostly acute healthcare” (e.g., skilled nursing and hospitals). We will primarily focus on product types at the initial and middle stages of this acuity continuum that have an emphasis on private pay sources of revenue:
 
General Acquisition and Investment Policies 
 While we intend to focus our investment strategy on income-producing student housing and senior housing properties and related real estate investments, we may also invest in student housing and senior housing properties and related real estate investments with growth potential. In addition, we may invest in other types of commercial real estate properties if our board of directors deems appropriate; however, we have no current intention of investing more than 20% of the net proceeds of this offering in such other commercial real estate properties. We will seek to make investments that will satisfy the primary investment objectives of providing regular cash distributions to our stockholders and achieving appreciation in the value of our properties and, hence, appreciation in stockholder value. 
 Our Advisor will have substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific properties. However, each acquisition will be approved by our board of directors. The consideration paid for a property will ordinarily be based on the fair market value of the property as determined by a majority of our board of directors. 
 10


There is no limitation on the number, size or type of properties that we may acquire or on the percentage of net offering proceeds that may be invested in any particular property type or single property. The number and mix of properties we acquire will depend upon real estate market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time of acquisition and the amount of proceeds raised in our offerings. In determining whether to purchase a particular property, we may obtain an option on such property. The amount paid for an option, if any, is normally surrendered if the property is not purchased and may or may not be credited against the purchase price if the property is ultimately purchased. 
 Growth Acquisition and Investment Strategy 
 In executing the growth portion of our investment strategy, we may seek to invest in student housing and senior housing properties that are to be developed, currently under development or in lease-up. We may also invest in student housing and senior housing properties that are in need of expansion, redevelopment or repositioning. We may acquire properties with lower quality construction, management or operators, with fewer services or amenities offered, or with low occupancy rates and reposition them by seeking to improve the property, management or operator quality, services, and occupancy rates and thereby increase lease revenues and overall property value. We may also acquire properties in markets that are overbuilt or otherwise overserved with the anticipation that, within our targeted holding period, the markets will recover and favorably impact the value of these properties. We may also acquire properties from sellers who are distressed or face time-sensitive deadlines with the expectation that we can achieve better success with the properties. 
Investments in Mortgage Loans 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had not invested in any mortgages. While we intend to emphasize equity real estate investments and, hence, operate as what is generally referred to as an “equity REIT,” as opposed to a “mortgage REIT,” we may invest in first or second mortgage loans, mezzanine loans secured by an interest in the entity owning the real estate, or other similar real estate loans consistent with our REIT status. We may make such loans to developers in connection with construction and redevelopment of properties. Such mortgages may or may not be insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans Benefits Administration, or another third party. We may also invest in participating or convertible mortgages if our directors conclude that we and our stockholders may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in the value of the subject property. Such mortgages are similar to equity participation. 
 However, our charter contains limitations with respect to the manner in which we may invest our funds in mortgage loans. 
 Our Borrowing Strategy and Policies 
 We intend to use medium-to-high leverage (between 55% to 60% loan to purchase price) to make our investments and, at certain times during our Offering, our debt leverage levels may be temporarily higher as we acquire properties in advance of funds being raised in our Offering. Our board of directors will regularly monitor our investment pipeline in relation to our projected fundraising efforts and otherwise evaluate market conditions related to our debt leverage ratios throughout our Offering. 
 We may incur our indebtedness in the form of bank borrowings, purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties and publicly- or privately-placed debt instruments or financing from institutional investors or other lenders, including bridge financing. We may obtain a credit facility or a separate loan for each acquisition. Our indebtedness may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests in our properties. We may use borrowing proceeds to finance acquisitions of new properties, to pay for capital improvements, repairs or buildouts, to refinance existing indebtedness, to pay distributions, to fund redemptions of our shares or to provide working capital. 
 There is no limitation on the amount we can borrow for the purchase of any property. Our aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, must be reasonable in relation to our net assets and must be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. Our charter limits our borrowing to 300% of our net assets, as defined (approximately 75% of the cost basis of our assets), unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report, with a justification for such excess. 
 We may borrow amounts from our Advisor or its affiliates only if such loan is approved by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction as fair, competitive, commercially reasonable, and no less favorable to us than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties under the circumstances. 
 11


Except as set forth in our charter regarding debt limits, we may re-evaluate and change our debt strategy and policies in the future without a stockholder vote. Factors that we could consider when re-evaluating or changing our debt strategy and policies include then-current economic and market conditions, the relative cost of debt and equity capital, any acquisition opportunities, the ability of our properties to generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service requirements, and other similar factors. Further, we may increase or decrease our ratio of debt to equity in connection with any change of our borrowing policies. 
 Acquisition Structure 
 Although we are not limited as to the form our investments may take, our investments in real estate will generally constitute acquiring fee title or interests in joint ventures or similar entities that own and operate real estate. We may also enter into the following types of leases relating to real property: 

• | a ground lease in which we enter into a long-term lease (generally greater than 30 years) with the owner for use of the property during the term whereby the owner retains title to the land; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a master lease in which we enter into a long-term lease (typically 10 years with multiple renewal options) with the owner in which we agree to pay rent to the owner and pay all costs of operating and maintaining the property (a net lease) and typically have an option to purchase the property in the future.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We will make acquisitions of our real estate investments directly or indirectly through our Operating Partnership. We will acquire interests in real estate either through one of our industry-specific holding companies, through our Operating Partnership, through other limited liability companies or limited partnerships, or through investments in joint ventures. 
 Conditions to Closing Acquisitions 
 Generally, we will not purchase any property unless and until we obtain at least a Phase I environmental assessment and history for each property to be purchased and we are sufficiently satisfied with the property’s environmental status. In addition, we will generally condition our obligation to close the purchase of any investment on the delivery and verification of certain documents from the seller or other independent professionals, including, but not limited to, where appropriate: 

• | appraisals, property surveys, and site audits;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | building plans and specifications, if available;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | soil reports, seismic studies, and flood zone studies, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | licenses, permits, maps, and governmental approvals;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | historical financial statements and tax statement summaries of the properties;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proof of marketable title, subject to such liens and encumbrances as are acceptable to us; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | liability and title insurance policies.
--+----------------------------------------

Joint Venture Investments 
 We may acquire some of our properties in joint ventures, some of which may be entered into with affiliates of our Advisor. We may also enter into joint ventures, general partnerships, co-tenancies, and other participations with real estate developers, owners, and others for the purpose of owning and leasing real properties. Among other reasons, we may want to acquire properties through a joint venture with third parties or affiliates in order to diversify our portfolio of properties in terms of geographic region or property type or to co-invest with one of our property management or senior living operator partners. Joint ventures may also allow us to acquire an interest in a property without requiring that we fund the entire purchase price. In addition, certain properties may be available to us only through joint ventures. In determining whether to recommend a particular joint venture, our Advisor will evaluate the real property which such joint venture owns or is being formed to own under the same criteria described elsewhere in this report. 
 12


We may enter into joint ventures with our Advisor or any of its affiliates for the acquisition of properties, but only provided that: 
  
• | a majority of our directors (including a majority of our independent directors) not otherwise interested in the transaction approve the transaction as being fair and reasonable to us; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the investment by us and the joint venture partner are on substantially the same terms and conditions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To the extent possible and if approved by our board of directors (including a majority of our independent directors), we will attempt to obtain a right of first refusal or option to buy if such venture partner elects to sell its interest in the property held by the joint venture. In the event that the venture partner were to elect to sell property held in any such joint venture, however, we may not have sufficient funds to exercise our right of first refusal to buy the venture partner’s interest in the property held by the joint venture. Entering into joint ventures with affiliates of our Advisor will result in certain conflicts of interest. 
 Investments in Delaware Statutory Trusts 
 Persons selling real estate held for investment often seek to reinvest the proceeds of that sale in another real estate investment in an effort to obtain favorable tax treatment under Section 1031 of the Code, referred to as like-kind exchanges. Our Sponsor and its affiliates have sponsored and are currently sponsoring Delaware statutory trusts (“DSTs”), which permit investors to effectuate like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Code. 
 A DST is a separate legal entity created as a trust under Delaware law that allows persons wishing to engage in like-kind exchanges to reinvest their proceeds in commercial real estate. The DST acquires title to the property or properties and may obtain a mortgage loan to finance a portion of the purchase price. The DST investors execute a trust agreement that governs the DST’s operations and provides for exclusive management by a signatory trustee that is an affiliate of the Sponsor.   In order to satisfy certain requirements under Section 1031 of the Code, the DST will master lease the property to an affiliate of the Sponsor which then assumes property management and pays the DST rent in the form of debt service payments to the lender plus additional rent as provided in the master lease.  Generally, the DST will acquire the subject property and through registered broker-dealers, sell beneficial interests in the DST to investors in a private offering.  The exchange participant owns a beneficial interest in the DST but is deemed for federal income tax purposes to own a direct ownership interest in the DST’s real property that is eligible for a like kind-exchange. Under Section 1031 of the Code, the DST investor may defer capital gains taxes that otherwise would be recognized on the sale of the investor’s real estate, the proceeds of which are reinvested in the DST. 
 From time to time, we may participate in DST investments if our board of directors determines that our participation is in the best interest of our stockholders. In the event that our board of directors determines that it is in our best interest to so participate, we may invest in a DST. However, the following provisions apply with respect to our investments in DSTs: 
  
• | We may invest in a DST only if a majority of our directors not otherwise interested in the transaction and a majority of our independent directors approves of the transaction as being fair, competitive, and commercially reasonable to us.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We anticipate that in the event we purchase a DST interest we will purchase the interest on the terms as other investors in the DST”s private offering of beneficial interests except that we would not be obligated to pay any selling commissions otherwise payable to broker dealers participating in the offering nor will we pay our Advisor acquisition fees or reimburse our Advisor for its expenses to the same extent as with other types of property acquisitions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On October 20, 2017, we completed an investment in a private placement offering by Reno Student Housing, DST (“Reno Student Housing”) using proceeds from our Private Offering of approximately $1.03 million for an approximately 2.6% beneficial interest. Reno Student Housing is a Delaware statutory trust and an affiliate of our Sponsor. Reno Student Housing owns a student housing property located in Reno, Nevada (the “Reno Property”).  In October 2018, we completed an investment of approximately $0.8 million in a private placement offering by Power 5 Conference Student Housing I, DST (“Power 5 Conference Student Housing”) using proceeds from the issuance of Preferred Units in our Operating Partnership for an approximately 1.4% beneficial interest. Power 5 Conference Student Housing is a Delaware statutory trust and an affiliate of our Sponsor. Power 5 Conference Student Housing owns two student housing properties located in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Columbia, South Carolina.  These DST investments and any future DST investments will be subject to various risks that may not otherwise present in real estate investments, such as the risk that the cash flow from the DST’s property will be insufficient to pay the full amount of rent to the DST.  (See “RISK FACTORS—Certain risks associated with investments in DSTs” below). 
 13


Our Sponsor, a DST, or the other DST investors may have economic or business interests or goals that are or may become inconsistent with our business interests or goals. For instance, our Sponsor will receive substantial fees in connection with its sponsoring of a DST and our participation in such a transaction could facilitate its consummation of the transactions. For these reasons, our Advisor may face a conflict in structuring the terms of the relationship between our interests and the interest of our Sponsor, the DST, or the other DST investors. As a result, agreements and transactions between the parties with respect to the property will not have the benefit of arm’s-length negotiation of the type normally conducted between unrelated parties. 
 Government Regulations 
 Our business is subject to many laws and governmental regulations. Changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and courts, occur frequently. 
 Americans with Disabilities Act 
 Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA, all public accommodations and commercial facilities are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. Complying with the ADA requirements could require us to remove access barriers. Failing to comply could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or an award of damages to private litigants. Although we intend to acquire properties that substantially comply with these requirements, we may incur additional costs to comply with the ADA. In addition, a number of additional federal, state, and local laws may require us to modify any properties we purchase, or may restrict further renovations thereof, with respect to access by disabled persons. Additional legislation could impose financial obligations or restrictions with respect to access by disabled persons. Although we believe that these costs will not have a material adverse effect on us, if required changes involve a greater amount of expenditures than we currently anticipate, our ability to make expected distributions could be adversely affected. 
Environmental Matters 
 Under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances. These laws often impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator was responsible for, or even knew of, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of investigating, removing, or remediating these substances may be substantial, and the presence of these substances may adversely affect our ability to rent units or sell the property, or to borrow using the property as collateral, and may expose us to liability resulting from any release of or exposure to these substances. If we arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at another location, we may be liable for the costs of removing or remediating these substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not the facility is owned or operated by us. We may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site that we own or operate. Certain environmental laws also impose liability in connection with the handling of or exposure to asbestos-containing materials, pursuant to which third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances.  
Tenant Rights and Fair Housing Laws 
 Various states have enacted laws, ordinances and regulations protecting the rights of housing tenants. Such laws may require us, our affiliated Property Manager, our third party managers or other operators of our senior housing properties to comply with extensive residential landlord requirements and limitations.
Healthcare Regulatory Matters 
 Ownership and operation of certain senior housing properties and other healthcare-related facilities are subject, directly and indirectly, to substantial federal, state and local government healthcare laws and regulations. The failure by us or our third party operators to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect the successful operation of our properties. For example, most senior housing facilities are subject to state licensing and registration laws. In granting and renewing these licenses, the state regulatory agencies consider numerous factors relating to a property’s physical plant and operations, including, but not limited to, admission and discharge standards, staffing, and training. A decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a property owner’s record with respect to patient and consumer rights, medication guidelines, and rules. In addition, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, requires the 
 14


use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for certain healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. Compliance with these regulations is mandatory for healthcare providers, such as, in some cases, our third party operators. The cost of compliance with these regulations may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of our third party operators and, therefore, may adversely affect us. We intend for all of our business activities and operations, as well as the business activities and operations of our third party operators, to conform in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, including healthcare laws, regulations and licensing requirements.
 Disposition Policies 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had not disposed of any of our properties. We generally intend to hold each property we acquire for an extended period. However, we may sell a property at any time if, in our judgment, the sale of the property is in the best interests of our stockholders. 
 The determination of whether a particular property should be sold or otherwise disposed of will generally be made after consideration of relevant factors, including prevailing economic conditions, other investment opportunities, and considerations specific to the condition, value, and financial performance of the property. In connection with our sales of properties, we may lend the purchaser all or a portion of the purchase price. In these instances, our taxable income may exceed the cash received in the sale. 
 We may sell assets to third parties or to affiliates of our Advisor. Our nominating and corporate governance committee of our board of directors, which is comprised solely of independent directors, must review and approve all transactions between us and our Advisor and its affiliates. 
 Investment Limitations in Our Charter 
 Our charter places numerous limitations on us with respect to the manner in which we may invest our funds, most of which are required by various provisions of the Statement of Policy Regarding Real Estate Investment Trusts published by the North American Securities Administrators Association (the “NASAA REIT Guidelines”). Pursuant to the NASAA REIT Guidelines, we will not: 

• | Invest in equity securities unless a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction approve such investment as being fair, competitive, and commercially reasonable.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invest in commodities or commodity futures contracts, except for futures contracts when used solely for the purpose of hedging in connection with our ordinary business of investing in real estate assets and mortgages.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invest in real estate contracts of sale, otherwise known as land sale contracts, unless the contract is in recordable form and is appropriately recorded in the chain of title.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Make or invest in mortgage loans unless an appraisal is obtained concerning the underlying property, except for those mortgage loans insured or guaranteed by a government or government agency. In cases where our independent directors determine, and in all cases in which the transaction is with any of our directors or our Advisor and its affiliates, we will obtain an appraisal from an independent expert. We will maintain such appraisal in our records for at least five years and it will be available to our stockholders for inspection and duplication. We will also obtain a mortgagee’s or owner’s title insurance policy as to the priority of the mortgage or condition of the title.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Make or invest in mortgage loans, including construction loans, on any one property if the aggregate amount of all mortgage loans on such property would exceed an amount equal to 85% of the appraised value of such property, as determined by an appraisal, unless substantial justification exists for exceeding such limit because of the presence of other loan underwriting criteria.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Make or invest in mortgage loans that are subordinate to any mortgage or equity interest of any of our directors, our Advisor, or their respective affiliates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Make investments in unimproved property or indebtedness secured by a deed of trust or mortgage loans on unimproved property in excess of 10% of our total assets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Issue equity securities on a deferred payment basis or other similar arrangement.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 15


 
• | Issue debt securities in the absence of adequate cash flow to cover debt service, unless the historical debt service coverage (in the most recently completed fiscal year), as adjusted for known changes, is sufficient to service that higher level of debt as determined by the board of directors or a duly authorized executive officer.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Issue equity securities that are assessable after we have received the consideration for which our board of directors authorized their issuance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Issue “redeemable securities” redeemable solely at the option of the holder, which restriction has no effect on our ability to implement our share redemption program.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grant warrants or options to purchase shares to our Advisor or its affiliates or to officers or directors affiliated with our Advisor except on the same terms as options or warrants that are sold to the general public. Further, the amount of the options or warrants cannot exceed an amount equal to 10% of outstanding shares on the date of grant of the warrants and options.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lend money to our directors, or to our Advisor or its affiliates, except for certain mortgage loans described above.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Borrow if such debt causes our total indebtedness to exceed 300% of our “net assets” (as defined in our charter in accordance with the NASAA REIT Guidelines), unless approved by a majority of the independent directors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Make an investment if the related acquisition fees and expenses are not reasonable or exceed 6% of the contract purchase price for the asset or, in the case of a mortgage loan, 6% of the funds advanced, provided that the investment may be made if a majority of the directors (including a majority of the independent directors) not otherwise interested in the transaction determines that the transaction is commercially competitive, fair, and reasonable to us.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Investment Allocation Policy 
 In the event that an investment opportunity becomes available, our Sponsor, acting through our advisor and the other advisory entities associated with another entity affiliated with our Sponsor (collectively, the “Program Advisors”), will allocate such investment opportunity to us or another entity affiliated with our Sponsor (each, “Another Real Estate Program”) based on the following factors: 

• | the investment objectives of each program;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | the amount of funds available to each program;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | the financial and investment characteristics of each program, including investment size, potential leverage, transaction structure and anticipated cash flows;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the strategic location of the investment in relationship to existing properties owned by each program;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the effect of the investment on the diversification of each program’s investments; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the impact of the financial metrics of the investment on each program.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 If, after consideration of the foregoing factors, our Sponsor, acting through the Program Advisors, determines that an investment opportunity is suitable for both us and Another Real Estate Program, then we will have priority for (i) “Class A” student housing properties located near medium- to large-sized, Tier 1 universities with Division I football programs and (ii) “Class A” senior housing properties focused on private pay sources of revenues in the “mostly housing” range of the acuity spectrum; and private programs sponsored by our Sponsor will have priority for all other student housing and/or senior housing properties, as well as any other student housing and senior housing properties passed upon by us. In the event all of the acquisition allocation factors have been exhausted and our Sponsor, acting through the Program Advisors, determines that an investment opportunity is suitable for both us and Another Real Estate Program, then our Sponsor will offer the investment opportunity to the program that has had the longest period of time elapse since it was offered an investment opportunity. 
 If a subsequent development, such as a delay in the closing of a property or a delay in the construction of a property, causes any such investment, in the opinion of our Advisor, to be more appropriate for a program other than the program that committed to make the investment, our Advisor may determine that another program affiliated with our Advisor or its affiliates will make the investment.
 16


Changes in Investment Policies and Limitations 
 Our charter requires that our independent directors review our investment policies at least annually to determine that the policies we are following are in the best interests of our stockholders. Each determination and the basis for that determination is required to be set forth in the applicable meeting minutes. The methods of implementing our investment policies may also vary as new investment techniques are developed. The methods of implementing our investment objectives and policies, except as otherwise provided in our charter, may be altered by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, without the approval of our stockholders. The determination by our board of directors that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to be qualified as a REIT shall require the concurrence of two-thirds of the board of directors. Investment policies and limitations specifically set forth in our charter, however, may only be amended by a vote of the stockholders holding a majority of our outstanding shares. 
Investment Company Act of 1940 and Certain Other Policies 
 We intend to operate in such a manner that we will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the 1940 Act. Our Advisor will continually review our investment activity to attempt to ensure that we do not come within the application of the 1940 Act. Among other things, our Advisor will attempt to monitor the proportion of our portfolio that is placed in various investments so that we do not come within the definition of an “investment company” under the 1940 Act. If at any time the character of our investments could cause us to be deemed as an investment company for purposes of the 1940 Act, we will take all necessary actions to attempt to ensure that we are not deemed to be an “investment company.”
 Subject to the restrictions we must follow in order to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, we may make investments other than as previously described in this report, although we do not currently intend to do so. We have authority to purchase or otherwise reacquire our common shares or any of our other securities. We have no present intention of repurchasing any of our common shares except pursuant to our share redemption program, and we would only take such action in conformity with applicable federal and state laws and the requirements for qualifying as a REIT under the Code. 
 Employees
 We have no employees. The employees of our Advisor and its affiliates provide management, acquisition, advisory and certain administrative services for us.
 Competition 
 The extent of competition in a market area depends significantly on local market conditions. The primary factors upon which competition in the student and senior housing industries are location, rental rates, suitability of the property’s design and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. We believe we will compete successfully on these bases. 
 Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do. Such competitors may, among other possible advantages, be capable of paying higher prices for acquisitions and obtaining financing on better terms than us.
