ITEM 1 — BUSINESS 
ORGANIZATION 
 The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc. (“THG”) is a holding company organized as a Delaware corporation in 1995. We trace our roots to as early as 1852, when the Hanover Fire Insurance Company was founded. Our primary business operations are property and casualty insurance products and services. We market our products and services through independent agents and brokers in the United States (“U.S.”). Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of THG; The Hanover Insurance Company (“Hanover Insurance”) and Citizens Insurance Company of America (“Citizens”), which are our principal property and casualty subsidiaries; and other insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries. Our results of operations also include the results of our discontinued operations, consisting primarily of our former Chaucer international business, as well as our former accident and health, and life insurance businesses. As discussed further in “Discontinued Operations” below, on December 28, 2018, we completed the sale of Chaucer Holdings Limited, the major portion of our Lloyd’s international specialty business, to China Reinsurance (Group) Corporation (“China Re”). We subsequently completed the sale of our Chaucer-related Irish entity on February 14, 2019. The sale of the Australian entities is pending, subject only to local regulatory approval, and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019. 
INFORMATION ABOUT OPERATING SEGMENTS 
 We conduct our business operations through three operating segments. These segments are Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, and Other. We report interest expense related to our corporate debt separately from the earnings of our operating segments. 
 Information with respect to each of our segments is included in “Results of Operations - Segments” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and in Note 14 – “Segment Information” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Information with respect to geographic concentrations is included in “Marketing and Distribution” below in Part 1 – Item 1 and in Note 14 – “Segment Information” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The following is a discussion of our operating segments. 
 GENERAL 
 In our Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments, we underwrite commercial and personal property and casualty insurance through Hanover Insurance, Citizens and other THG subsidiaries, through an independent agent and broker network concentrated in the Northeast, Midwest and Southeast U.S. We also continue to actively grow our Commercial Lines’ presence in the Western region of the U.S., particularly in California, which now is our largest state for Commercial Lines as measured by net premiums written. Included in our Other segment are Opus Investment Management, Inc. (“Opus”), a wholly owned subsidiary of THG, which provides investment management services to our insurance and non-insurance companies, as well as to unaffiliated institutions, pension funds and other organizations; earnings on holding company assets; holding company and other expenses, including certain costs associated with retirement benefits due to former life insurance employees and agents; and a run-off voluntary pools business. 
 Our business strategy focuses on providing our agents and customers with competitive insurance products delivered with clear and consistent underwriting and pricing expectations, while prudently growing and diversifying our product and geographical business mix. We conduct our business with an emphasis on disciplined underwriting, pricing, quality claim handling, and customer service. In 2018, we wrote approximately $4.8 billion in gross premiums. Agency relationships and active agency management are core to our strategy. Based on net premiums written, we rank among the top 25 property and casualty insurers in the United States. 
 RISKS 
 The industry’s and our profitability are each significantly affected by numerous factors, including price; competition; volatile and unpredictable developments, such as extreme weather conditions, catastrophes and other disasters; legal and regulatory developments affecting pricing, underwriting, policy coverage and other aspects of doing business, as well as insurer and insureds’ liability; extra-contractual liability; increased attorney involvement; size of jury awards; acts of terrorism; fluctuations in interest rates or the value of investments; and other general economic conditions and trends, such as inflationary pressure or unemployment, that may affect the adequacy of reserves or the demand for insurance products. Our investment portfolio and its future returns are impacted by the capital markets and current economic conditions, which affect our liquidity, realized losses and impairments, credit default levels, our ability to hold such investments until recovery and other factors. Additionally, the economic conditions in geographic locations where we conduct business, especially those locations where our business is concentrated, affect the growth and profitability of our business. The regulatory environments in those locations, including any pricing, underwriting or product controls, shared market mechanisms or mandatory pooling arrangements, and other conditions, such as our agency relationships, affect the growth and profitability of our business. Our loss and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) reserves are based on estimates, principally involving case assessments and actuarial projections, at a given time, of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances then known, predictions of future events, estimates of future trends in claims frequency and severity and judicial 
 3


theories of liability, costs of repairs and replacement, legislative activity and other factors. We regularly reassess our estimate of loss reserves and LAE, both for current and past years, and resulting changes have and will affect our reported profitability and financial position. 
 Reference is also made to “Risk Factors” in Part 1 – Item 1A.

Our Commercial Lines product suite provides agents and customers with products designed for small, middle and specialized markets. 
 Commercial Lines coverages include: 
 Commercial multiple peril coverage insures businesses against third-party general liability from accidents occurring on their premises or arising out of their operations, such as injuries sustained from products sold. It also insures business property for damage, such as that caused by fire, wind, hail, water damage (which may include flood), theft and vandalism. 
 Commercial automobile coverage insures businesses against losses incurred from personal bodily injury, bodily injury to third parties, property damage to an insured’s vehicle and property damage to other vehicles and property. Commercial automobile policies are often written in conjunction with other commercial policies.

 Our strategy in Commercial Lines focuses on building deep relationships with partner independent agents through differentiated product offerings, industry segmentation, and franchise value through limited distribution. We continue to make enhancements to our products and technology platforms that are intended to drive more total account placements in our small commercial and middle market business, while delivering enhanced margins in our specialty businesses. This aligns with our focus of delivering the capabilities that will help expand the depth and breadth of our partnerships with a limited number of agents. 
 Our small commercial, middle market and specialty businesses each constitute approximately one-third of our total Commercial Lines business. Small commercial offerings, which generally include premiums of $50,000 or less, deliver value through product expertise, local presence, and ease of doing business. Middle market accounts, with premiums generally in the range of $50,000 to $250,000, require greater claim and underwriting expertise, as well as a focus on industry segments where we can deliver differentiation in the market and value to agents and customers. Small and middle market accounts comprise approximately $1.7 billion of the Commercial Lines segment net premiums written. Our specialty lines of business include inland marine, management and professional liability, AIX program business, surety and specialty property.
 In our small commercial and middle market businesses, we offer coverages and capabilities in several key industries including technology, schools, and human services organizations, such as non-profit youth and community service organizations. We also provide further segmentation in our core middle market commercial products, including real estate, hospitality, manufacturing, contractors and wholesale distributors. 
 Part of our strategy is to expand our specialty lines offerings in order to provide our agents and policyholders with a broader product portfolio and to increase our market share of our partner agents’ total business. We have over time acquired various specialized businesses aimed at further diversifying and growing our specialty lines. We used these acquisitions as platforms to expand our product offerings and grow through our existing agency and broker distribution network. 
 We believe our small commercial capabilities, distinctiveness in the middle market, and continued development of specialty business provides us with a more diversified portfolio of products and enables us to deliver significant value to our agents and policyholders. We believe these efforts will enable us to continue to improve the overall mix of our business and ultimately our underwriting profitability. 
 Personal Lines 
 Our Personal Lines segment generated $1.8 billion, or 39.4%, of consolidated operating revenues and $1.8 billion, or 40.5%, of net premiums written, for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
 The following table provides net premiums written by line of business for our Personal Lines segment. 
 
 
 | Net Premiums | | | 
-----------------------------+--------------+---------+------------+------
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 | Written | | % of Total
(in millions, except ratios) | | | | | 
Personal automobile | $ | 1,127.5 | | 63.6 | %
Homeowners | | 604.0 | | 34.0 | 
Other | | 42.6 | | 2.4 | 
Total | $ | 1,774.1 | | 100.0 | %

 
Personal Lines coverages include: 
 Personal automobile coverage insures individuals against losses incurred from personal bodily injury, bodily injury to third parties, property damage to an insured’s vehicle, and property damage to other vehicles and other property. 
 Homeowners coverage insures individuals for losses to their residences and personal property, such as those caused by fire, wind, hail, water damage (excluding flood), theft and vandalism, and against third-party liability claims. 
 Other personal lines are comprised of personal inland marine (jewelry, art, etc.), umbrella, fire, personal watercraft, earthquake and other miscellaneous coverages. 
 Our strategy in Personal Lines is to provide account–oriented business (i.e., writing both an insured’s automobile and homeowners insurance) through our partner agencies, with a focus on increasing geographic diversification. The market for our Personal Lines business is very competitive, with continued pressure on independent agents from direct writers, as well as from the increased usage of 
 5


real time comparative rating tools and increasingly sophisticated rating and pricing tools. We maintain a focus on partnering with high quality, value-added agencies that stress the importance of consultative selling and account rounding (the conversion of single policy customers to accounts with multiple policies and/or additional coverages). We are focused on making investments that are intended to help us maintain profitability, build a distinctive position in the market, and provide us with profitable growth opportunities. We continue to refine our products and to work closely with these high potential agents to increase the percentage of business they place with us and to ensure that it is consistent with our preferred mix of business. Additionally, we remain focused on further diversifying our state mix beyond the largest historical core states of Michigan, Massachusetts and New York. We expect these efforts to decrease our risk concentrations and our dependency on these three states, as well as to contribute to improved profitability over time. 
 Other 
 The Other segment consists of: Opus, which provides investment advisory services to affiliates and also manages approximately $3.1 billion of assets for unaffiliated institutions such as insurance companies, retirement plans and foundations, including $1.6 billion of funds managed for Chaucer subsequent to the completion of the sale. We anticipate that we will continue to manage these assets in connection with a new investment management arrangement. The Other segment also includes earnings on holding company assets; holding company and other expenses, including certain costs associated with retirement benefits due to former life insurance employees and agents; and our run-off voluntary pools business.
MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION 
 We serve a variety of standard, specialty and targeted industry markets. Consistent with our objective to diversify our underwriting risks on a geographic and line of business basis, we currently have a split of approximately 40% Personal Lines, 40% core Commercial Lines, and 20% specialty lines. Commercial Lines, including our small, middle market and specialty businesses, and Personal Lines segments distribute our products primarily through an independent agent network. 
Commercial and Personal Lines 
 Our Commercial and Personal Lines agency distribution and field structure are designed to maintain a strong focus on local markets and the flexibility to respond to specific market conditions. During 2018, we wrote 20.5% of our Commercial and Personal Lines business in Michigan and 9.6% in Massachusetts. Our structure is a key factor in the establishment and maintenance of productive, long-term relationships with well-established independent agencies. We maintain 41 local offices across 28 states. The majority of processing support for these locations is provided from Worcester, Massachusetts; Howell, Michigan; Salem, Virginia; and Windsor, Connecticut. 
 Independent agents account for substantially all of the sales of our Commercial and Personal Lines property and casualty products. Agencies are appointed based on profitability, track record, financial stability, professionalism, and business strategy. Once appointed, we monitor their performance and, subject to legal and regulatory requirements, may take actions as necessary to change these business relationships, such as discontinuing the authority of the agent to underwrite certain products or revising commissions or bonus opportunities. We compensate agents primarily through base commissions and bonus plans that are tied to an agency’s written premium, growth and profitability. 
 We are licensed to sell property and casualty insurance in all fifty states in the U.S., as well as in the District of Columbia. Throughout the U.S., we actively market Commercial Lines policies in 37 states and Personal Lines policies in 18 states.

We manage our Commercial Lines portfolio, which includes our core and specialty businesses, with a focus on growth from the most profitable industry segments within our underwriting expertise. Our core business is generally comprised of several coordinated commercial lines of business, including small and middle market accounts, which include targeted industry segments. Such business is split between small accounts, generally having less than $50,000 in premium, and middle market accounts, those with premium over $50,000, with most middle market accounts having less than $250,000 of premium. Additionally, we have multiple specialty lines of business, which include inland marine, management and professional liability, AIX program business, surety and specialty property. The Commercial Lines segment seeks to maintain strong agency relationships as an approach to secure and retain our agents’ best business. We monitor quality of business written through ongoing quality reviews, accountability for which is shared at the local, regional and corporate levels. 
 We manage Personal Lines business with a focus on acquiring and retaining preferred accounts. Currently, approximately 84% of our policies in force are account business. Approximately 56% of our Personal Lines net premium written is generated in the combined states of Michigan and Massachusetts. In Michigan, based upon direct premiums written for 2018, we underwrite approximately 6% of the state’s total market. 
 Approximately 68% of our Michigan Personal Lines business is in the personal automobile line and 31% is in the homeowners line. Michigan business represents approximately 46% of our total personal automobile net premiums written and approximately 39% of our total homeowners net premiums written. In Michigan, we are a principal market for many of our appointed agencies, with approximately $2.0 million of total direct premiums written per agency in 2018. 
 Approximately 69% of our Massachusetts Personal Lines business is in the personal automobile line and 29% is in the homeowners line. Massachusetts business represents approximately 14% of our total personal automobile net premiums written and approximately 11% of our total homeowners net premiums written. 
 We sponsor local and national agent advisory councils to gain the benefit of our agents’ insight and enhance our relationships. These councils provide feedback, input on the development of products and services, guidance on marketing efforts, support for our strategies, and assist us in enhancing our local market presence.

Other 
 With respect to our Other segment business, we market our investment advisory services directly through Opus. 
 PRICING AND COMPETITION 
 The property and casualty industry is a very competitive market. Our competitors include national, international, regional and local companies that sell insurance through various distribution channels, including independent agencies, captive agency forces, brokers and direct to consumers through the internet or otherwise. They also include mutual insurance companies, reciprocals and exchanges. In the Commercial and Personal Lines segments, we market through independent agents and brokers and compete for business on the basis of product, price, agency and customer service, local relationships, ratings, and effective claims handling, among other things. We believe that our emphasis on maintaining strong agency relationships and a local presence in our markets, coupled with investments in products, operating efficiency, technology and effective claims handling, enable us to compete effectively. Our broad product offerings in Commercial Lines and total account strategy in Personal Lines are instrumental to our ability to capitalize on these relationships and improve profitability. 
 We seek to achieve targeted combined ratios in each of our product lines. Targets vary by product and geography and change with market conditions. The targeted combined ratios reflect competitive market conditions, investment yield expectations, our loss payout patterns, and target returns on equity. This approach is intended to enable us to achieve measured growth and consistent profitability. 
 For all major product lines in the Commercial and Personal Lines segments, we employ pricing teams which produce exposure and experience-based rating models to support underwriting and pricing decisions. In addition, we seek to utilize our understanding of local markets to achieve superior underwriting results. We rely on market information provided by our local agents and on the knowledge of staff in the local branch offices. Since we maintain a strong regional focus and a significant market share in a number of states, we can better apply our knowledge and experience in making underwriting and rate setting decisions. Also, we seek to gather objective and verifiable information at a policy level during the underwriting process, including prior loss experience, past driving records and, where permitted, credit histories. 
 CLAIMS MANAGEMENT 
 Claims management includes the receipt of initial loss notifications, generation of appropriate responses to claim reports, loss appraisals, identification and handling of coverage issues, determination of whether further investigation is required, retention of legal representation where appropriate, establishment of case reserves, approval of loss payments and notification to reinsurers. Part of our strategy focuses on efficient, timely, and fair claim settlements to meet customer service expectations and maintain valuable independent agent relationships. Additionally, effective claims management is important to our business since claim payments and related loss adjustment expenses are our single largest expenditures. 
 We utilize experienced claims adjusters, appraisers, medical specialists, managers and attorneys to manage our claims. Our U.S. property and casualty operations have field claims adjusters located throughout the states and regions in which we do business. Claims field staff members work closely with the independent agents who bound the policies under which coverage is claimed. Claims office adjusting staff is supported by general adjusters for large property and large casualty losses, by automobile and heavy equipment damage appraisers for automobile material damage losses, and by medical specialists whose principal concentration is on workers’ compensation and automobile injury cases. Additionally, the claims offices are supported by staff attorneys, both in the home office and in regional locations, who specialize in litigation defense and claim settlements. We have a catastrophe response team to assist policyholders impacted by severe weather events. This team mobilizes quickly to impacted regions, often in advance for a large tracked storm, to support our local claims adjusters and facilitate a timely response to resulting claims. We also maintain a special unit that investigates suspected insurance fraud and abuse. We utilize claims processing technology which allows most of the smaller and more routine Personal Lines claims to be processed at centralized locations. 
 CATASTROPHES 
 We are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes, which historically have had a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Coverage for such events is a core part of our business, and we expect to experience catastrophe losses in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and position. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fire, explosions, and terrorism. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are volatile and difficult to predict. 
 We endeavor to manage our catastrophe risks through underwriting procedures, including the use of deductibles and specific exclusions for floods and earthquakes, subject to regulatory restrictions and competitive pressures, and through geographic exposure management and reinsurance. The catastrophe reinsurance program is structured to protect us on a per-occurrence and aggregate excess basis. We monitor geographic location and coverage concentrations in order to manage corporate exposure to catastrophic events. Although catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of property and casualty lines, commercial multiple peril and homeowners property coverages have, in the past, generated the majority of catastrophe-related claims.

REINSURANCE
 Reinsurance Program Overview 
 We maintain ceded reinsurance programs designed to protect against large or unusual loss and LAE activity. We utilize a variety of proportional and non-proportional reinsurance agreements, which are intended to control our individual policy and aggregate exposure to large property and casualty losses, stabilize earnings and protect capital resources. These programs include facultative reinsurance (to limit exposure on a specified policy); specific excess and proportional treaty reinsurance (to limit exposure on individual policies or risks within specified classes of business); and catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance (to limit exposure to any one event that might impact more than one individual contract). Our proportional reinsurance consists of quota share reinsurance agreements and our non-proportional reinsurance includes excess of loss and stop loss reinsurance agreements.
 Catastrophe reinsurance protects us, as the ceding insurer, from significant losses arising from a single event including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fire, explosions and terrorism. We determine the appropriate amount of reinsurance based upon our evaluation of the risks insured, exposure analyses prepared by consultants, our risk appetite and on market conditions, including the availability and pricing of reinsurance. Although we believe our catastrophe reinsurance program, including our retention and co-participation amounts for 2019, is appropriate given our surplus level and the current reinsurance pricing environment, there can be no assurance that our reinsurance program will provide coverage levels that will prove adequate should we experience losses from one significant or several large catastrophes during 2019. Additionally, as a result of the current economic environment, as well as losses incurred by reinsurers in the past several years, the availability and pricing of appropriate reinsurance programs may be adversely affected in future renewal periods. We may not be able to pass these costs on to policyholders in the form of higher premiums or assessments.
 We cede to reinsurers a portion of our risk based upon insurance policies subject to such reinsurance. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our obligations to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to us. We believe that the terms of our reinsurance contracts are consistent with industry practice in that they contain standard terms with respect to lines of business covered, limit and retention, arbitration and occurrence. We believe our reinsurers are financially sound, based upon our ongoing review of the financial strength ratings assigned to them by rating agencies, their reputations in the reinsurance marketplace, our collections history, advice from third parties, and the analysis and guidance of our reinsurance advisors. 
 Although we exclude coverage of nuclear, chemical or biological events from the Personal Lines and Commercial Lines policies we write in the U.S., we are statutorily required to provide this coverage in our workers’ compensation policies. We have workers’ compensation reinsurance coverage under our casualty reinsurance treaty of approximately $80 million for terrorism losses, limited to approximately $10 million for losses that result from nuclear, chemical or biological events. All other U.S.-based exposure or treaties exclude such coverage. Further, under The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“TRIPRA”), our share of U.S. domestic losses in 2018 from such events, if deemed certified terrorist events, is limited to 18% of losses in excess of an approximate $412 million deductible, up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of $100 billion. Such events could be material to our financial position or results of operations. See also “Terrorism” below for additional information. 
 Reference is made to Note 16 — “Reinsurance” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reference is also made to “Involuntary Residual Markets”. 
 Our 2019 reinsurance program for our Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments is substantially consistent with our 2018 program design. The following discussion summarizes both our 2018 and 2019 reinsurance programs for our Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments (excluding coverage available under the U.S. federal terrorism program which is described under “Terrorism”), but does not purport to be a complete description of the program or the various restrictions or limitations which may apply: 
  
• | Our Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments are primarily protected by a property catastrophe occurrence treaty, a property per risk excess of loss treaty, as well as a casualty excess of loss treaty, with retentions of $200 million, $2 million, and $2 million, respectively. We have lower retentions in place for certain lines, as discussed below.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The property catastrophe occurrence treaty provides coverage, on an occurrence basis, up to $1.1 billion countrywide, less a $200 million retention, with no co-participation, for all defined perils. Effective July 1, 2018, we added a top and aggregate feature which provides for up to $75 million of coverage in excess of $300 million in aggregate domestic losses, or against a single extreme event on the top of our $1.1 billion reinsurance treaty. The domestic catastrophe losses subject to the aggregate feature are limited only to those events that exceed $7.5 million of incurred losses.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The property per risk excess of loss treaty provides coverage, on a per risk basis, up to $100 million, less a $2 million retention, with a co-participation for the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019 of 25% for reinsurance placed in the $2 million to $3 million layer and no co-participation for reinsurance placed in the $3 million to $100 million layer.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | The casualty excess of loss treaty provides coverage, on a per occurrence basis for each loss, up to $75 million less a $2 million retention, with no co-participation. Umbrella and excess liability lines share coverage with casualty lines within the $2 million to $10 million layers, subject to a maximum umbrella limit of $5 million. There is also separate umbrella and excess liability only coverage that provides protection for the $5 million to $25 million layer. The casualty program provides coverage for management liability and healthcare lines in a $1 million to $2 million layer, with co-participations ranging from 45% to 65%.

• | For 2018 and 2019, Commercial Lines segments are further protected by excess of loss treaty agreements for specific lines of business. For example, the surety and fidelity bond excess of loss treaty provides coverage, on a per principal basis, up to $40 million, less a $5 million retention, with co-participations of 50% for the $5 million to $10 million layer and no co-participation for the $10 million to $40 million layer.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In addition to certain layers of coverage from our Commercial and Personal Lines segment reinsurance program as described above, the Commercial Lines AIX Holdings, Inc. (“AIX”) program business also includes surplus share, quota share, excess of loss, stop loss, facultative and other forms of reinsurance that cover the writings from AIX specialty and proprietary programs. There are approximately 55 different AIX programs, and the reinsurance structure is customized to fit the exposure profile for each program.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our intention is to renew the surety and fidelity bond treaty, the property per risk excess of loss treaty and the property catastrophe treaty in July 2019 with the same or similar terms and conditions, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current levels of reinsurance, pricing and terms and conditions. Our 2019 casualty excess of loss treaty is effective January 1, 2019 for a twelve month period. 
 Reinsurance Recoverables 
 We share insurance risk of the primary underlying contracts with various insurance entities through the use of reinsurance contracts. As a result, when we experience loss events that are subject to a reinsurance contract, reinsurance recoveries are recorded. The amount of the reinsurance recoverable can vary based on the size of the individual loss or the aggregate amount of all losses in a particular line, book of business or an aggregate amount associated with a particular accident year. The valuation of losses recoverable depends on whether the underlying loss is a reported loss, or an incurred but not reported loss. For reported losses, we value reinsurance recoverables at the time the underlying loss is recognized, in accordance with contract terms. For incurred but not reported losses, we estimate the amount of reinsurance recoverable based on the terms of the reinsurance contracts and historical reinsurance recovery information and apply that information to the gross loss reserve estimates. The most significant assumption we use is the average size of the individual losses that will exceed our reinsurance retentions for those claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us. The reinsurance recoverable is based on what we believe are reasonable estimates and is disclosed separately on the financial statements. However, the ultimate amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled. 
 Other than our investment portfolio, the single largest asset class is our reinsurance receivables, which consist of our estimate of amounts recoverable from reinsurers with respect to losses incurred to date (including losses incurred but not reported) and unearned premiums, net of amounts estimated to be uncollectible. These estimates are expected to be revised at each reporting period and such revisions, which could be material, affect our results of operations and financial position. Reinsurance recoverables include amounts due from state mandatory reinsurance or other involuntary risk sharing mechanisms, and private reinsurers to whom we have voluntarily ceded business. 
 We are subject to concentration of risk with respect to reinsurance ceded to various mandatory residual markets, facilities and pooling mechanisms. As a condition to conduct business in various states, we are required to participate in residual market mechanisms, facilities and pooling arrangements which usually are designed to provide insurance coverages to individuals or other entities that are otherwise unable to purchase such coverage voluntarily or at rates deemed reasonable. These market mechanisms, facilities and pooling arrangements comprise $990.9 million of our total reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and unearned premiums at December 31, 2018, $977.1 million of which is attributable to the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (“MCCA”). 
 The MCCA is a mandatory reinsurance association which reinsures claims under Michigan’s unlimited personal injury protection coverage which is required under all Michigan automobile insurance policies. The MCCA reinsures all such claims in excess of a statutorily established company retention, currently $555,000. Funding for MCCA comes from assessments against automobile insurers based upon their share of insured automobiles in the state. Insurers are allowed to pass along this cost to Michigan automobile policyholders. This recoverable accounted for 64% and 63% of our total personal automobile gross reserves at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Reinsurance recoverables related to MCCA were $977.1 million and $930.6 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Because the MCCA is supported by assessments permitted by statute, and there have been no significant uncollectible balances from MCCA identified during the three years ending December 31, 2018, we believe that we have no significant exposure to uncollectible reinsurance balances from this entity. 
 10


In addition to the reinsurance ceded to various residual market mechanisms, facilities, and pooling arrangements we have $655.9 million of reinsurance assets due from traditional reinsurers as of December 31, 2018. These amounts are due principally from highly-rated reinsurers, defined as rated A- or higher by A.M. Best or other equivalent rating agency. The following table displays balances recoverable from our ten largest reinsurance groups at December 31, 2018, along with the A.M. Best rating for each group’s ultimate parent or lead rating unit. Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of paid losses recoverable, outstanding losses recoverable, incurred but not reported losses recoverable, and ceded unearned premium.

Reinsurance recoverable balances in the table above are shown before consideration of balances owed to reinsurers and any potential rights of offset, including collateral held by us, and are net of an allowance for uncollectible recoverables. Reinsurance treaties are generally purchased on an annual basis. Treaties typically contain provisions that allow us to demand that a reinsurer post letters of credit or assets as security if a reinsurer is an unauthorized reinsurer under applicable regulations or if its rating falls below a predetermined contractual level. In regards to reinsurance recoverables due from Lloyd’s Syndicates, as part of the Lloyd’s “chain of security” afforded to all of its policyholders, recourse is available to the Lloyd’s Central Fund in the event of the failure of an individual syndicate and its capital providers. 
 Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims to our policyholders. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. Specifically, our reinsurers may not pay claims made by us on a timely basis, or they may not pay some or all of these claims. In addition, from time to time insurers and reinsurers may disagree on the scope of the reinsurance or on the underlying insured risks. Any of these events would increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 We have established a reserve for uncollectible reinsurance of $3.9 million as of December 31, 2018, or 0.2% of the total reinsurance recoverable balance, which was determined by considering reinsurer specific default risk on paid and unpaid recoverables as indicated by their financial strength ratings, any ongoing solvency issues, any current risk of dispute on paid recoverables, and our past collection experience. There have been no significant balances determined to be uncollectible and thus no significant charges recorded during 2018 for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. 
 Our exposure to credit risk from any one reinsurer is managed through diversification by reinsuring with a number of different reinsurers, principally in the United States and European reinsurance markets. When reinsurance for our Commercial and Personal Lines segments is placed, our standards of acceptability generally require that a reinsurer must have a minimum policyholder surplus of $500 million, a rating from A.M. Best and/or S&P of “A” or better, or an equivalent financial strength if not rated. In addition, for lower rated reinsurers, certain reinsurers for our insurance operations that have not been granted authorized status by an insurance company’s state of domicile, and in certain other circumstances, reinsurers must generally provide collateral equal to 100% of estimated reinsurance recoverables. The collateral can serve to mitigate credit risk.

TERRORISM 
 As a result of the continuing threat of terrorist attacks, the insurance industry maintains a high level of focus with respect to the potential for losses caused by terrorist acts. Insured losses may encompass people, property and business operations covered under workers’ compensation, commercial multiple peril and other Commercial Lines policies, as well as Personal Lines policies. In certain cases, we are not able to exclude coverage for these losses, either because of regulatory requirements or competitive pressures. We continually evaluate the potential effect of these low frequency, but potentially high severity events in our overall pricing and underwriting plans, especially for policies written in major metropolitan areas. 
 Although certain terrorism-related risks embedded in our Commercial and Personal Lines are covered under the existing Catastrophe, Property per Risk and Casualty Excess of Loss corporate reinsurance treaties (see “Reinsurance” for additional information), private sector catastrophe reinsurance is limited and generally unavailable for losses attributed to acts of terrorism, particularly those involving nuclear, biological, chemical and/or radiological events. As a result, the industry’s primary reinsurance protection against large-scale terrorist attacks in the U.S. is provided through a Federal program that provides compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism.
 The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 first established the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (the “Program”). Coverage under the Program applies to workers’ compensation, commercial multiple peril, and certain other Commercial Lines policies for direct written policies. TRIPRA extended the Program through December 31, 2020. All commercial property and casualty insurers participate in the program. Under the program, a participating issuer, in exchange for making terrorism insurance available, may be entitled to be reimbursed by the Federal government for a portion of its aggregate losses. The Program does not cover losses in surety, Personal Lines or certain other lines of business. Losses caused by terrorist acts are not excluded from homeowners or personal automobile policies. 
 As required by the current Program, we offer policyholders in specific lines of commercial insurance the option to elect terrorism coverage. In order for a loss to be reinsured under the Program, the loss must meet aggregate industry loss minimums and must be the result of an act of terrorism as certified by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the U.S. Attorney General. Losses from acts which do not qualify or are not so certified will not receive the benefit of the Program and in fact, may be deemed covered losses whether or not terrorism coverage was purchased. The current Program requires insurance carriers to retain 19% of any claims from a certified terrorist event in excess of the federally mandated deductible in 2019, subject to an annual industry-wide cap of $100 billion. This retention will increase to 20% in 2020. The federally mandated deductible represents 20% of direct earned premium for the covered lines of business of the prior year. In 2018, our deductible was $412 million, which represents 19.9% of year-end 2017 statutory policyholder surplus of our insurers, and is estimated to be $431 million in 2019, representing 19.8% of 2018 year-end statutory policyholder surplus. 
 Given the unpredictability of terrorism losses, future losses from acts of terrorism could be material to our operating results, financial position, and/or liquidity. We attempt to manage our exposures on an individual line of business basis and in the aggregate by one-half square mile grids in major metropolitan areas. 
 REGULATION 
 Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which they transact business and are supervised by the individual state insurance departments. Numerous aspects of our business are subject to regulation, including premium rates, mandatory covered risks, limitations on the ability to non-renew or reject business, prohibited exclusions, licensing and appointment of agents, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other obligations, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, investments and capital, policy forms and coverages, advertising, and other conduct, including restrictions on the use of credit information and other factors in underwriting, as well as other underwriting and claims practices. States also regulate various aspects of the contractual relationships between insurers and independent agents. 
 Such laws, rules and regulations are usually overseen and enforced by the various state insurance departments, as well as through private rights of action and by state attorneys general. Such regulations or enforcement actions are often responsive to current consumer and political sensitivities, such as automobile and homeowners insurance rates and coverage forms, or which may arise after a major event. Such rules and regulations may result in rate suppression, limit our ability to manage our exposure to unprofitable or volatile risks, or lead to fines, premium refunds or other adverse consequences. The federal government also may regulate aspects of our businesses, such as the use of insurance (credit) scores in underwriting and the protection of confidential information. 
 In addition, as a condition to writing business in certain states, insurers are required to participate in various pools or risk sharing mechanisms or to accept certain classes of risk, regardless of whether such risks meet their underwriting requirements for voluntary business. Some states also limit or impose restrictions on the ability of an insurer to withdraw from certain classes of business. For example, Massachusetts, New York and California each impose material restrictions on a company’s ability to materially reduce its exposures or to withdraw from certain lines of business in their respective states. The state insurance departments can impose significant charges on an insurer in connection with a market withdrawal or refuse to approve withdrawal plans on the grounds that they could lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal of policies or that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may significantly restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets. Such actions and related regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to reduce our potential exposure to hurricane-related losses. 
 12


The insurance laws of many states subject property and casualty insurers doing business in those states to statutory property and casualty guaranty fund assessments. The purpose of a guaranty fund is to protect policyholders by requiring that solvent property and casualty insurers pay the insurance claims of insolvent insurers. These guaranty associations generally pay these claims by assessing solvent insurers proportionately based on each insurer’s share of voluntary premiums written in the state. While most guaranty associations provide for recovery of assessments through subsequent rate increases, surcharges or premium tax credits, there is no assurance that insurers will ultimately recover these assessments, which could be material, particularly following a large catastrophe or in markets which become disrupted. 
 We are subject to periodic financial and market conduct examinations conducted by state insurance departments. We are also required to file annual and other reports with state insurance departments relating to the financial condition of our insurance subsidiaries and other matters. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) and the Federal Insurance Office are each actively engaged in reviewing and considering proposed insurer risk-based capital standards, risk analysis, solvency assessments and other regulatory initiatives.
 INVOLUNTARY RESIDUAL MARKETS 
 As noted above, as a condition of our license to write business in various states, we are required to participate in mandatory property and casualty residual market mechanisms which provide insurance coverages where such coverage may not otherwise be available at rates deemed reasonable. Such mechanisms provide coverage primarily for personal and commercial property, personal and commercial automobile, and workers’ compensation, and include assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and involuntary pools, joint underwriting associations, fair access to insurance requirements (“FAIR”) plans, and commercial automobile insurance plans. 
 For example, since most states compel the purchase of a minimal level of automobile liability insurance, states have developed shared market mechanisms to provide the required coverages and in many cases, optional coverages, to those drivers who, because of their driving records or other factors, cannot find insurers who will insure them voluntarily. Also, FAIR plans and other similar property insurance shared market mechanisms increase the availability of property insurance in circumstances where homeowners are unable to obtain insurance at rates deemed reasonable, such as in coastal areas or in areas subject to other hazards. Licensed insurers writing business in such states are often required to pay assessments to cover reserve deficiencies generated by such plans. 
 With respect to FAIR plans and other similar property insurance shared market mechanisms that have significant exposures, it is difficult to accurately estimate our potential financial exposure for future events. Assessments following a large coastal event, particularly one affecting Massachusetts, Texas, New York, or North Carolina, or a large wildfire event affecting California, could be material to our results of operations. Our participation in such shared markets or pooling mechanisms is generally proportional to our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific pooling mechanism in the applicable state or other jurisdiction. For example, we are subject to mandatory participation in the Michigan Assigned Claims (“MAC”) facility. MAC is an assigned claim plan covering people injured in uninsured motor vehicle accidents. Our participation in the MAC facility is based on our share of personal and commercial automobile direct written premium in the state and resulted in underwriting losses of $14.3 million in 2018. There were no other mandatory residual market mechanisms that were significant to our 2018. 
 RESERVE FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES 
 Reference is made to “Results of Operations - Segments – Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses” of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. See also Note 17 – “Liabilities for Outstanding Claims, Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 The following table reconciles reserves determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance statutory authorities (“Statutory”) to reserves determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The primary difference between the Statutory reserves and our GAAP reserves is the requirement, on a GAAP basis, to present reinsurance recoverables as an asset, whereas Statutory guidance provides that reserves are reflected net of the corresponding reinsurance recoverables. We do not use discounting techniques in establishing GAAP reserves for property and casualty losses and LAE, nor have we participated in any loss portfolio transfers or other similar transactions.

Reserves for discontinued accident and health business of our insurance subsidiaries are included in liabilities of discontinued operations for GAAP and loss and loss adjustment expenses for Statutory reporting. 
 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
 Discontinued operations primarily include our former Chaucer operations and our discontinued accident and health business.
 Chaucer
 The Chaucer business sold property and casualty insurance products internationally through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Chaucer Holdings Limited (“Chaucer”), which operates through the Society and Corporation of Lloyd’s (“Lloyd’s”) and is domiciled in the United Kingdom. During the third quarter of 2018, all of our Chaucer business was classified as discontinued operations. On December 28, 2018, we completed the sale of Chaucer, the major portion of our Lloyd’s international specialty business, to China Re. As part of the sale, we entered into certain transition arrangements and agreed to indemnify China Re for litigation and other regulatory matters that existed as of the closing of the sale. (See also “Risk Factors” in Part I – Item 1A). We subsequently completed the sale of our Chaucer-related Irish entity on February 14, 2019. The sale of the Australian entities is pending, subject only to local regulatory approval, and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019. We received $28 million of additional consideration for the Irish entity, and we expect to receive $13 million of additional consideration related to the Australian entities. At December 31, 2018, assets and liabilities associated with the Chaucer-related Irish and Australian entities are reflected as assets and liabilities held-for-sale.
 The result of operations of the Chaucer business through December 28, 2018 is included in our results of discontinued operations. During 2018, the Chaucer business generated $850.0 million of net earned premium and $20.0 million of income. See the “Discontinued Chaucer Business” section in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Note 2 – “Discontinued Operations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Prior to its sale to China Re, Chaucer, as a non-U.S. subsidiary of THG, was permitted to engage in certain transactions with Iran prior to President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action Regarding Iran’s Nuclear Program (the “JCPOA”).  As a result of such activity, the following disclosure is provided pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended:
 During the applicable reporting period, January 1 through December 31, 2018, and pursuant to General License H which was then in effect at all relevant times under the JCPOA, a Chaucer syndicate maintained a 5% participation in an aviation reinsurance arrangement to reinsure Bimeh Iran (“Iran Insurance Company”), an insurer wholly-owned by the Government of Iran. The arrangement reinsured the hull, liability and cargo risks incurred by the underlying insured, Iran Air. Bimeh Markazi, another insurer wholly-owned by the Government of Iran, was an additional reinsured. This reinsurance arrangement, which was in effect for the period June 22, 2017 through June 21, 2018, was compliant with General License H and contained a “sanctions exclusion” clause which terminated coverage in the event Chaucer was no longer legally permitted to provide coverage under applicable law. Estimated total gross revenues from this arrangement were approximately $275,000, and total revenues, net of brokerage expenses and estimated retrocession costs, were approximately $179,500. It is not possible at this time to determine the net profit from the arrangement, although as of December 31, 2018, no claims were paid by the Chaucer syndicate to either of the reinsureds. The agreement expired on June 21, 2018 and was not renewed. 
 Accident and Health and Life Businesses
 The discontinued accident and health business includes interests in 24 accident and health reinsurance pools and arrangements that we retained subsequent to the sale of First Allmerica Financial Life Insurance Company (“FAFLIC”) in 2009. We ceased writing new premiums in this business in 1999, subject to certain contractual obligations. The reinsurance pool business consists primarily of long-term care, the medical and disability portions of workers’ compensation risks, assumed personal accident, individual medical, long-term disability, and special risk business. This business also includes residual health insurance policies. Total reserves for the assumed accident and health business were $113.2 million at December 31, 2018. The long-term care pool accounts for approximately 69% of our reserves as of December 31, 2018. Reserves for the long-term care pool, individual medical, and residual health insurance policies are discounted. Reserves for all other assumed accident and health business are undiscounted. Assets and liabilities related to the discontinued accident and health business are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued life business. 
 Loss estimates associated with substantially all of the discontinued accident and health business are provided by managers of each pool. We adopt reserve estimates for this business that consider this information, expected returns on assets assigned to this business and other facts. We update these reserves as new information becomes available and further events occur that may affect the ultimate resolution of unsettled claims. Based on information provided to us by the pool managers, we believe that the reserves recorded related to this business are adequate. However, since reserve and claim cost estimates related to the discontinued accident and health business are dependent on several assumptions, including, but not limited to, morbidity, lapses, future premium rates, future health care costs, persistency of medical care inflation and investment performance, and these assumptions can be impacted by technical developments and advancements in the medical field and other factors, there can be no assurance that the reserves established for this business will prove sufficient. Revisions to these reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular quarterly or annual period or on our financial position.  See also “Risk Factors” in Part I – Item 1A.
 14


Our long-term care pool accounts for the majority of our remaining reinsurance pool business. The potential risk and exposure of our long-term care pool is based upon expected estimated claims and payment patterns, using assumptions for, among other things, morbidity, lapses, future premium rates, and the interest rate used for discounting the future projected cash flows. The long-term exposure of this pool depends upon how our actual experience compares with these future cash flow projection assumptions.
 Our former life insurance businesses, which are also included in discontinued operations, include activities that were not significant to our 2018, 2017 or 2016 results.
 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO 
 Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Opus, is responsible for managing our investment portfolio. Opus directly manages our entire fixed income portfolio and certain other assets which together constitute approximately 92% of our entire investment portfolio. Opus is also responsible for the selection and monitoring of external asset managers for our commercial mortgage loan participations and certain other investments. We select and monitor external managers based on investment style, performance and corporate governance. 
 Our investments are generally of high quality and our fixed maturities and equities are broadly diversified across sectors of the fixed income and equity markets. Our overall investment strategy is intended to balance investment income with credit and interest rate risk, while maintaining sufficient liquidity and providing the opportunity for capital growth. The asset allocation process takes into consideration the types of business written and the level of surplus required to support our different businesses and the risk return profiles of the underlying asset classes. We look to balance the goals of capital preservation, net investment income stability, liquidity and total return.
 The majority of our assets are invested in the fixed income markets. Through fundamental research and credit analysis, with a focus on value investing, Opus seeks to identify a portfolio of stable income-producing higher quality U.S. government, foreign government, municipal, corporate, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities. We have a general policy of diversifying investments both within and across major investment and industry sectors to mitigate credit and interest rate risk. We monitor the credit quality of our investments and our exposure to individual markets, borrowers, industries, sectors and, in the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage loan participations, property types and geographic locations. 
 Investments held by our insurance subsidiaries are subject to diversification requirements under state insurance laws. Investment considerations include asset/liability profile, including duration, convexity and other characteristics within specified risk tolerances. The investment portfolio duration is approximately 4.5 years. We seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to support our cash flow requirements by monitoring the cash requirements associated with our insurance and corporate liabilities, laddering the maturities within the portfolio, closely monitoring our investment durations, holding high quality liquid public securities and managing the purchases and sales of assets. 
 Reference is made to “Investments” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. 
 RATING AGENCIES 
 Insurance companies are rated by financial strength rating agencies to provide both industry participants and insurance consumers information on specific insurance companies. Higher ratings generally indicate the rating agencies’ opinion regarding financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims. 
 Strong ratings are important factors in marketing our products to our agents and customers, since rating information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe that a rating of “A-” or higher from A.M. Best Co. is particularly important for our business. Insurance company financial strength ratings are assigned to an insurer based upon factors deemed by the rating agencies to be relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors. Such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy, hold or sell any security. 
 EMPLOYEES 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,200 employees, substantially all of whom are located in the United States. We believe our relations with employees are good.
