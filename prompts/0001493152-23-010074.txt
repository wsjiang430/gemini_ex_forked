Item 1. Business.
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context indicates otherwise, “Clubhouse Media,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours” or “us” refer to Clubhouse Media Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and its subsidiaries, including West of Hudson Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.
 
Business Overview
 
We are a social media firm and digital agency. Our Company deal-making services through our digital agency a creator content monetization platform, and an investment arm for joint ventures and acquisitions for companies in the social media influencer space. Our management team consists of successful entrepreneurs with financial, legal, marketing, and digital content creation expertise.
 
Through our subsidiary, West of Hudson Group, Inc. (“WOHG”), we currently generate revenues primarily from (i) through Doiyen, LLC (“Doiyen”), a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of WOHG, talent management of social media influencers; (ii) through WOH Brands, LLC (“WOH Brands”), a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of WOHG, which operates Honeydrip.com, a new digital platform with a focus on the empowerment of creators. The site allows creators to connect with fans and sell exclusive photo and video content; (iii) through The Reiman Agency, a 51% majority held joint venture which brokers brand promotional deals between brands and talent.
 
WOHG is either 100% owner and sole member and manager of each of these entities, or a majority controlling shareholder pursuant to each of the limited liability company agreements and bylaws, where applicable, that govern these entities, and has complete and exclusive discretion in the management and control of the affairs and business of WOH Brands, Doiyen, The Reiman Agency, and Magiclytics possesses all powers necessary to carry out the purposes and business of these entities. WOHG is entitled to the receipt of all income (and/or losses) that these entities generate.
 
In addition to the above, WOHG is the 100% owner of two other limited liability companies – Clubhouse Studios, LLC, which holds most of our intellectual property, and DAK Brands, LLC, each incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 13, 2020. However, each of these entities has minimal or no operations, and is not intended to have any material operations in the near future.
 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, Clubhouse Media generated revenues of $6,283,691 and reported a net loss of $7,525,731 and negative cash flow from operating activities of $1,958,875. As noted in the consolidated financial statements of Clubhouse Media, as of December 31, 2022, Clubhouse Media had an accumulated deficit of $32,814,971. There is substantial doubt regarding the ability of Clubhouse Media to continue as a going concern as a result of its historical recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations as well as its dependence on private equity and financings. See “Risk Factors—Clubhouse Media has a history of operating losses and its management has concluded that factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern and the auditor of Clubhouse Media has included explanatory paragraphs relating to its ability to continue as a going concern in its audit report for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.”
 
Principal Products and Services
 
Our current principal products and services are comprised of (i) our digital agency and (ii) Honeydrip.com.
 
“The Clubhouse” Online Presence
 
“The Clubhouse” network previously consisted of physical locations. In 2022, we determined to focus exclusively on our digital agency and creator monetization platform. Accordingly, we closed our physical Clubhouses in 2021. There are numerous “Clubhouse” accounts owned by The Clubhouse, with a following across Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and TikTok. These accounts are directly held by us (as opposed to the Clubhouse team of influencers) and therefore we have direct access to the followers of these accounts, which we consider to be our followers.
Talent Management and Digital Agency Services
 
Doiyen, our indirectly wholly owned subsidiary, is a talent management company and digital agency for social media influencers and generates revenues based on the earnings of its influencer-clients (or “Creators”) by receiving a percentage of the earnings of its Creators. Certain influencers enter into an Exclusive Management Agreement (each, a “Management Agreement”). Through Doiyen, we seek to represent some of the world’s top talent in the world of social media. We plan to hire experienced talent and management agents as well as build our support and administrative resources seeking to expand operations. Our influencers include entertainers, content creators, and style icons.
 
We are dedicated to helping Doiyen’s influencer-clients build their brands, maintain creative control of their destinies, and diversify and grow their businesses through “The Clubhouse,” providing them opportunities to increase their monetization potential and amplify their reach.
 
Paid Promotion
 
Doiyen and its Creators (both contracted and third party) primarily generate revenue from companies paying for promotion for their brands, products, and/or services.
 
The primary type of arrangement through which we will receive revenues from these activities through Doiyen is:
 

(i) | As a talent management company and digital agency, Doiyen generates revenues based on the earnings of its influencer-clients Creators by receiving a percentage of the earnings of its Creators. Creators are often sought after directly by companies for specific branding and/or promotional opportunities. In these situations, the client-company would contract with the Creator directly, and such services provided by the Creator would fall under the Management Agreement, and Doiyen would receive a percentage of the earnings of the Creator for such services as described above.

The site allows creators to connect with fans and sell exclusive photo and video content 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brand Development
 
On May 19, 2020, WOH Brands began to engage in brand development, with a focus on creating apparel, beauty, and other lifestyle brands with quality product offerings. Through WOH Brands, our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary, we intend to acquire, enter into joint ventures or launch best-in-class brands with an objective of innovation and product uniqueness, derived from demographic data, market research, and omni-channel experiences.
 
WOH Brands is primarily focused on creating brands on our behalf and may consider joint-ventures with other established companies in the consumer-packaged goods space for purposes of brand and production creation. WOH Brands will not provide its branding or product services to third parties outside of the Clubhouse Media-family of companies other than companies with which it may enter into a joint venture or other companies it contracts with to do so.
 
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K , WOH Brands has only sold a minimal amount of products, and has only generated minimal revenues.
 
Content Creation
 
WOH Brands acts as an internal studio for us, with the ability to develop ideas for, produce, and film content.
 
Magiclytics provides predictive analytics for content creation brand deals.
 
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, WOH Brands’ activities in this area have been limited to assisting in the development and management of the wholly owned creator content monetization platform, Honeydrip.com.
Planned Operations
 

● | Brand Development. As stated above, WOH Brands intends to acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or create new brands in apparel, beauty, and other lifestyle categories in the future. We believe that we are in a unique position to gather data intelligence from our dealings with paid brand deals. While companies pay Doiyen and our influencers to promote their products or services, we gain firsthand insight into what type of brands (and their corresponding products and services) resonate with our demographic. We believe that this information better positions WOH Brands in deciding what type of product or service to acquire or build. WOH Brands will not provide its brand development services to third parties outside of the Clubhouse Media-family of companies, but may engage in joint ventures with third parties. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Content Creation. In the future, WOH Brands intends to create entertainment content for streaming services and other platforms in the entertainment and/or social media space. WOH Brands expects it could receive ad revenues, revenues for licensing, and/or revenues for sales of content to purchasers in this space. 
● | Technology Development / Software. WOH Brands also intends to continue to develop its Magiclytics software, which provides predictive ROI on influencer campaigns. 
● | Subscription Services. In September 2021, the Company launched its subscription-based site HoneyDrip.com, a new digital platform designed and owned by Clubhouse Media Group with a focus on the empowerment of creators. The site allows creators to connect with fans and sell exclusive photo and video content. We plan to continue to expand the number of users and creators on the site. 

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

Advertising has shifted significantly towards social media over the last few years, and social media influencers who are the primary form of advertisement distribution is highly disorganized. We believe that one of the most important aspects of building a company or launching a product is social media marketing. According to Sprout Social, as of January 2022, there are 3.96 billion total social media users across all platforms. This makes social media marketing a great tool for any company.
 
According to a Business Insider Intelligence report titled “Influencer Marketing: State of the social media influencer market in 2021” originally published in December 2019 and updated February 2021, influencer marketing spending has grown significantly since 2015 and is expected to reach $15 billion annually by 2022. According to the same source, currently 78% of companies spend over 10% of their marketing budget on influencer marketing and 11% of companies allocate more than 40% of their marketing budget on influencer marketing and the percentage is expected to grow as more companies become comfortable with the channel. Also according to the same source, companies surveyed about influencer marketing noted that content quality, aligned target audience demographic and engagement rate were the three most important determinants in choosing influencer partners and that the two most important goals for influencer marketing based on survey responses were increasing brand awareness and reaching new audiences in order to expand their existing customer base. Furthermore, according to Influencer Marketing Hub, the influencer marketing spend is projected to reach $16.4 billion in 2022.
 
We intend to capitalize on this growing social media and influencer based advertising spending, utilizing our Clubhouse influencers to attract advertisers directly, as well as generating business for Creators, for which we will receive compensation pursuant to our Management Agreements.
 
Competition
 
As a talent management company through Doiyen, we compete against other talent management companies that are specific to the social media influencer space, such as IZEA and Viral Nation. We compete with these other companies on the basis of our brand name, reputation for access to industry participants and desirable projects, as well as pricing.
 
For our brands and products, we currently compete primarily with other specialty retailers, higher-end department stores and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of women’s and men’s apparel, accessories and similar merchandise targeting customers aged 12 to 30. We believe the principal basis upon which we compete are design, quality, and price. We believe that our primary competitive advantage is high visibility, which we can achieve through our network of Clubhouse influencers.
 
For our platform Honeydrip.com, we directly compete with OnlyFans, an industry leader. HoneyDrip differentiates itself from OnlyFans by being an Invite only site, our site is female empowering, and we offer an inhouse account management services for creators.
 
In the future, we expect to compete with other content-creators for placement on streaming services and other content platforms, with technology and software companies in the social media space, and with companies making lifestyle and/or beauty products marketed to social media audiences.
 
We seek to effectively compete with such competitors by out-scaling our competition, focusing on in-house business infrastructure and providing superior support and management services for our Clubhouse influencers. We strive to have more physical locations than other influencer-house networks. Currently, we are unaware of any other company that is combining into one business the various business aspects in which we engage. In addition, we believe the experience of our management team provides us with a significant advantage in the social media influencer business, as participants in this space have traditionally lacked the business experience that our executive management team possesses, which we intend to use to our advantage. Notwithstanding, we may not be able to effectively compete with such competitors.
 
Customers
 
Our customers include our influencer-clients, or Creators (through Doiyen), companies that contract directly with us (through Doiyen) for paid promotion, and the consumers that purchase our products (through WOH Brands).
 
Doiyen and its Creators have already worked with a number of notable brands, including, but not limited to, Fashion Nova, Spotify, McDonalds, Amazon, and Boohoo.
 
All products that we sell are marketed through our Clubhouse team of influencers, who provide promotion and marketing social media posts on our behalf.

Effects of Coronavirus on the Company
 
Due to the digital/remote nature of our business, we believe that the effects of Coronavirus on the company are limited.
 
Organizational History
 
Clubhouse Media Group, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 19, 2006 with the name Tongji Healthcare Group, Inc. by Nanning Tongji Hospital, Inc. (“NTH”). On the same day, Tongji, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, was incorporated in the State of Colorado. Tongji, Inc. was later dissolved on March 25, 2011.
 
NTH was established in Nanning in the province of Guangxi of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”) by the Nanning Tongji Medical Co. Ltd. and an individual on October 30, 2003.
 
NTH was a designated hospital for medical insurance in the city of Nanning and Guangxi province with 105 licensed beds. NTH specializes in the areas of internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, emergency medicine, ophthalmology, medical cosmetology, rehabilitation, dermatology, otolaryngology, traditional Chinese medicine, medical imaging, anesthesia, acupuncture, physical therapy, health examination, and prevention.
 
On December 27, 2006, Tongji, Inc. acquired 100% of the equity of NTH pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which NTH became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tongji Inc. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, we issued 15,652,557 shares of common stock to the shareholders of NTH in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of NTH. The acquisition of NTH was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting since the shareholders of NTH obtained control of the entity. Accordingly, the reorganization of the two companies was recorded as a recapitalization of NTH, with NTH being treated as the continuing operating entity. The Company, through NTH, thereafter operated the hospital, until the Company eventually sold NTH, as described below.
 
Effective December 31, 2017, under the terms of a Bill of Sale, we agreed to sell, transfer convey and assign forever all of its rights, title and interest in its equity ownership interest in its subsidiary, NTH, to Placer Petroleum Co., LLC, an Arizona limited liability company. Pursuant to the Bill of Sale, consideration for this sale, transfer conveyance and assignment is Placer Petroleum Co, LLC assuming all assets and liabilities of NTH as of December 31, 2017. As a result of the Bill of Sale, the related assets and liabilities of Nanning Tongji Hospital, Inc. was reported as discontinued operations effective December 31, 2017. Thereafter, the Company had minimal operations.
 
On May 20, 2019, pursuant to Case Number A-19-793075-P, Nevada’s 8th Judicial District, Business Court entered and Order Granting Application of Joseph Arcaro as Custodian of Tongji Healthcare Group, Inc. pursuant to NRS 78.347(1)(b), pursuant to which Joseph Arcaro was appointed custodian of the Company and given authority to reinstate the Company with the State of Nevada under NRS 78.347. On May 23, 2019, Joseph Arcaro filed a Certificate of Reinstatement of the Company with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. In addition, on May 23, 2019, Joseph Arcaro filed an Annual List of the Company with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, designating himself as President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director of the Company for the filing period of 2017 to 2019.

Share Exchange Agreement - Magiclytics

On February 3, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Share Exchange Agreement (the “A&R Share Exchange Agreement”) by and between the Company, Magiclytics, each of the shareholders of Magiclytics (the “Magiclytics Shareholders”) and Christian Young, as the representative of the Magiclytics Shareholders (the “Shareholders’ Representative”). Christian Young is the President, Secretary, and a Director of the Company, and is also an officer, director, and significant shareholder of Magiclytics.
 
The A&R Share Exchange Agreement amended and restated in its entirety the previous Share Exchange Agreement between the same parties, which was executed on December 3, 2020. The A&R Share Exchange Agreement replaces the Share Exchange Agreement in its entirety.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the A&R Share Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire from the Magiclytics Shareholders, who hold an aggregate of 5,000 shares of Magiclytics’ common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Magiclytics Shares”), all 5,000 Magiclytics Shares, representing 100% of Magiclytics’ issued and outstanding capital stock, in exchange for the issuance by the Company to the Magiclytics Shareholders of the 734,689 shares of the Company’s common stock based on a $3,500,000 valuation of Magiclytics, to be apportioned between the Magiclytics Shareholders pro rata based on their respective ownership of Magiclytics Shares.

The number of shares of the Company common stock issued at the Magiclytics Closing was based on the fair market value of the Company common stock as initially agreed to by the parties, which is $4.76 per share (the “Base Value”).

The $25,000 original issue discounts, the fair value of 50,000 shares issued, and the beneficial conversion features were recorded as debt discounts and amortized over the term of the note. Therefore, the total debt discounts at the inception date of this convertible promissory note were $217,024.
