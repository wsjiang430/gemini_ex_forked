Item 1. Business
Overview
 
AudioEye is a marketplace leader providing digital accessibility technology solutions for our clients’ customers through our Ally Platform products. Our solutions advance accessibility with patented technology that reduces barriers, expands access for individuals with disabilities, and enhances the user experience for a broader audience of users. We believe that, when implemented our solutions offer businesses the opportunity to reach more customers, improve brand image, build additional brand loyalty, and, most importantly, provide an accessible and usable web experience to the expansive and ever-growing population of individuals with disabilities throughout the world. In addition, our solutions help organizations comply with internationally accepted Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (“WCAG”) as well as U.S., Canadian, Australian, and United Kingdom accessibility laws.
 
We generate revenues through the sale of subscriptions of our software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) technology platform, called the AudioEye Ally Platform, to website owners, publishers, developers, Content Management System (“CMS”) platform providers and operators through the delivery of managed services combined with the implementation of our solutions. Our solutions have been adopted by some of the largest and most influential companies in the world. Our customers span disparate industries and target market verticals, which encompass (but are not limited to) the following categories: human resources, finance, retail/ecommerce, food services, automotive, transportation, hospitality, media, and education. Government agencies, both at the federal level and state and local levels have also integrated our software in their digital platforms.
 
AudioEye customers fall into one of two distinct sales channels: direct and indirect. In the direct channel, AudioEye sales personnel engage directly with the customer. In the indirect channel, AudioEye engages with customers, who are referred to as Indirect Channel Partners, who provide a website hosting platform for their end-user customers, and who serve as an authorized reseller of the AudioEye solution to their customers. Indirect channel sales have been a key factor in the acceleration of the AudioEye sales and marketing strategy. By working with strategically identified resellers, these partners provide a unique opportunity allowing AudioEye to onboard more end-user customers in a shorter period of time. By working with providers of the proprietary content management systems, AudioEye leverages economies of scale to deliver the AudioEye solution in a cost-effective and highly efficient way. In middle and lower markets, this strategy has helped make accessibility accessible to industries that would otherwise neglect the important issue of digital inclusion, altogether. We believe that there is significant opportunity for us to increase revenues by delivering our solutions through this indirect channel and therefore will continue to invest capital and resources in expanding our strategic partner business.
 
Industry Background
 
Millions of Internet users are impacted by disabilities that prevent them from accessing and using digital content on an equivalent basis. If not coded properly, a website may not offer full functionality for all users, in particular for users of assistive technology (“AT”), such as a screen reader. As a result, they may exclude potential users and customers. These sites also may not comply with U.S. and foreign laws addressing equal access and digital inclusion.


Traditional solutions addressing web accessibility may be costly and difficult to implement. Historically, the process for achieving compliance has been driven by costly consulting services and has not fully utilized emerging technologies to reduce the compliance cost burden. At the same time, web accessibility efforts have generally focused on a limited number of disability use cases, leaving many users’ accessibility needs for digital inclusion unaddressed. Businesses may have been reluctant to invest further in web accessibility solutions due to a perceived lack of commercial return on the significant investment required in order to design and implement a thorough and usable compliance solution.
 
Conventional solutions have been developed to help users access websites, but these systems often require plug-ins or software to be installed on the user’s computer. Many of these solutions are tailored to single or a limited number of use cases and do not encompass a more holistic approach for addressing a wider range of use cases. In some cases, these systems can be costly, unwieldy and inconvenient. Furthermore, the assistive software’s ability to understand, process, and interpret complex and dynamic web applications that are prevalent across the web today is dependent on the quality in which the code was designed and developed, including the level to which the website adheres to best practices and standards.

Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property is primarily comprised of trade secrets, trademarks, issued, published and pending patent applications, copyrights and technological innovation. We have a patent portfolio comprised of six issued patents in the United States and we have received notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a seventh patent; we have four published/pending patent applications, one pending patent application and one patent application being prepared for filing with the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) (internationally).
 
We have a trademark portfolio comprised of one allowed trademark application, two published trademark applications, and six trademark registrations.
 
Our current patented invention relates to a server-side method and apparatus that enables users to audibly navigate websites and hear high-quality streaming audio narration and descriptions of websites. This patented invention involves creating an audio-enabled web experience by utilizing voice talent and automated text-to-speech conversion methods to read and describe web content.
 
Our current portfolio has established a foundation for building unique technology solutions that contribute to the way in which we differentiate ourselves from other competitors in the B2B Web Accessibility marketplace. We plan to continue to invest in research and development and expand our portfolio of proprietary intellectual property.
 
Business Plan and Strategy
 
Leveraging our own patented Ally Platform product suite, we provide cloud-based, enterprise-grade technology solutions, as well as managed services to fully implement our solution and position our clients’ sites to more fully conform with web accessibility best practices. Our technology and professional service offerings may be purchased through a subscription service for either a one-year or multi-year term. Functionally, the business is organized into Executive, Sales, Marketing, Engineering (which includes intellectual property development), Implementation, Quality Assurance, and Customer Experience. Intellectual property development is tasked with the development of new leading-edge intellectual property.
 
Through the sale of managed and self-service contracts, our business model is to sell Business to Business and to secure revenue from multiple business channels, including (but not limited to): providers of CMS, corporate website owners, publishers, developers, and operators, federal, state and local governments, educational institutions, e-learning and e-commerce websites, kiosk companies, and not-for-profit organizations.
 
In what Forrester Research, Inc., a market research company that provides advice on existing and potential impact of technology, has called the “age of the customer”, we believe that, by adopting our solutions, our customers gain a competitive advantage by ensuring a superior digital experience for all of their customers, in particular for persons with diverse abilities. Some of the many leading advantages of our solution include:
 

1. | Maintaining a mission of inclusion and accessibility for the approximately 15% of the population with a disability or physical limitation who are denied full access to online digital content.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Increasing the client return on investment by opening access to the spending power of the 15% of the population that is denied equal access to the internet. 
3. | Maximizing conformance with WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria. 
4. | Deploying a cost-effective and fully-managed solution that is scalable with rapid deployment and little to no project management. 
5. | Consistently providing an enhanced customer experience for our client customers by providing access to innovative and universally designed technology solutions. 

 
Our primary objective is to establish and maintain a long-standing relationship with our customers, as a trusted and reliable provider of web accessibility technology and services.

Product Service Offerings
 
AudioEye uses proprietary technology and development tools to offer advanced web accessibility fully-managed solutions that offer significant savings in time and money relative to traditional solutions. Our compliance solutions focus on rapid remediation of common accessibility issues, followed by in-depth analysis identifying and addressing a more comprehensive compliance program. Our technology was built to not only provide users with a cloud-based assistive toolset that gets embedded and made freely available to users within our client websites, but to also improve the code in a way that optimizes the user experience for users of existing third-party assistive technologies, such as screen readers.
 
We offer a diversified portfolio of service offerings that are broken into two broad business categories: subscription to our web accessibility technology platform and managed services.
 
Our web accessibility technology platform (The AudioEye Ally Platform) consists of the Digital Accessibility Platform and Ally Managed Service, which are offered as an Internet Cloud SaaS subscription service. AudioEye offers two distinct Web Accessibility solution offerings: Digital Accessibility Platform and Ally Managed Service.
 
The AudioEye Digital Accessibility Platform empowers web developers to improve their websites using the most current, innovative, and industry-leading tools. The Digital Accessibility Platform is primarily a self-service solution for clients who want to own the accessibility process from beginning to end and puts the power of accessibility issue tracking, auditing and remediation in the hands of developers. This improves the usability and accessibility of their web infrastructures. For organizations that are developing web accessibility, this robust site evaluation tool provides detailed information to help developers and designers fully understand the identified issues as well as the different WCAG 2.1 best practices that may be implemented in order to improve their website through changes implemented at the source. WCAG 2.1 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations.
 
For organizations looking to offload the accessibility process, the Ally Managed Service allows AudioEye Accessibility Engineers and AT Usability Testers to do the vast majority of the heavy lifting in order to achieve accessibility and compliance for our clients. This unique offering leverages a balance of system and engineer generated remediation techniques to programmatically fix website problems that inhibit full access to our customers’ electronic information technologies. By providing our customers with full access to the Digital Accessibility Platform and working with them on a long-term basis to provide automated and manual testing in order to allow them to fully understand the issues of accessibility and how to develop with web accessibility in mind, AudioEye is able to reduce the burden on IT resources, leaving only limited work for finite client resources. In conjunction with the implementation of the AudioEye JavaScript, AudioEye makes available the option to publish the Ally Toolbar, which includes the Help Desk and Certification Statement. The Help Desk provides support for end-users who have issues accessing content, while the Certification Statement outlines our client’s commitment to providing an accessible and usable website experience for individuals with disabilities. As part of the Ally Managed Service, AudioEye makes available detailed reporting that provide the client with the results of web accessibility remediation efforts.

   As an additional revenue source, AudioEye provides Managed Services that support the SaaS model infrastructure. When clients adopt the Digital Accessibility Platform as a self-service tool, AudioEye markets and sells managed services that include the following: Product Support, Accessibility Training from accessibility engineers and subject matter experts, Manual Assistive Technology Usability Testing, and other ad hoc services such as Video Transcription & Captioning, PDF Accessibility Solutions, Audio Description Authoring, Accessibility Help Desk, and more. These same services are also provided to customers adopting the Ally Managed Service solution and go beyond the inherent managed services that are part of the implementation of website remediation, the provision of the Ally Toolbar, and, ultimately, the certification of our clients’ websites and web applications.
 
Customers
 
Our potential customer base includes a broad range of private and public sector customers, including, in particular:
 

· | Corporate enterprises; 
--+--------------------------
· | Educational institutions;


· | Federal, state, and local governments and agencies; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------
· | Not-for-profit organizations; and 
· | End-user customers of the CMS website hosting providers.

 
If we are unable to establish, maintain or replace our relationships with customers and develop a diversified customer base, our revenues may fluctuate, and our growth may be limited. The Company had one major customer (including their affiliates) which generated approximately 11.8% of its revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Company had two major customers (including their respective affiliates) which generated approximately 18.0% and 10.4%, respectively, of its revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
 
Corporate Enterprises
 
Our management believes that corporate enterprises and the CMS platform providers are both markets for the Company’s products and services. Management believes that the AudioEye Ally Managed Service product provides a business advantage for our clients by enabling them to better reach the large population of customers who are not able to gain equal access to our clients’ content, products, and services delivered via their websites.
 
Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act was enacted to help eliminate barriers to access. Just as building owners must implement physical accommodations to remove any physical barrier to access, transportation, or communication, website owners must adhere to Web Accessibility best practices in order to ensure barrier-free access to their websites and online materials. Over time, a website owner must maintain and prove their implementation of those techniques, such as those outlined within the globally recognized WCAG.
 
Government and Not-for-Profit Organizations
 
Federal and state laws require that the information and services made available across government agency websites meet the diverse and unique needs of all site visitors. Conforming to Web Accessibility best practices and guidelines helps ensure public access to government information and improves the value of agency investment in their websites and online services.

The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Rehabilitation Act”) requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a federal department or agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public without disabilities. The federal government also requires vendors selling to the government to be compliant under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, unless covered by a provable exception. Canada and the European Union have similar requirements.
 
Seniors and print-impaired individuals need the Internet’s critical access to fundamental state, local and federal government services and information such as tax forms, social programs, emergency services and legislative representatives. In addition, the roughly 120,000 federal employees with disabilities require Internet accessibility for workplace productivity. The AudioEye Reader in the cloud provides an intuitive Internet experience across all Internet-enabled devices without imposing any additional costs on end-users. For government site administrators, our Digital Accessibility Platform is designed to be user-friendly so that sites can be made accessible and maintained as part of any web management process.
 
Over 100 governments have signed and ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Company’s certification seal demonstrates a website owner’s commitment to meeting internationally accepted accessibility standards (). As a result, our management believes that providing accessibility services for website owners and developers has become a significant market opportunity in view of the potential demand across millions of internet websites.
 
The AudioEye solution provides a unique approach to solving a pervasive issue that has inhibited government agencies from embracing efficiencies gained through adopting new cost-effective technological capabilities. More and more federal agencies are beginning to embrace cloud-based service offerings and to leverage the capabilities afforded through the adoption of third-party cloud-based service providers. Implementing the AudioEye solution allows federal, state, and local governments to provide constituents with a reliable, scalable, and fully accessible web environment. By pairing the AudioEye Solution with other disparate SaaS offerings, organizations can more readily comply with the ADA standards. Implementing AudioEye mitigates risk of non-conformance and goes beyond basic levels of compliance through the inclusion of free cloud-based assistive tools, which lives up to the spirit of ADA - a noble and necessary aspiration for all federal, state and local government agencies.
 
Our solutions are sold by our direct sales team and through strategic partnerships and resellers. This strategy enables us to address all the broad markets covered by our technology and allows for a depth and market penetration that we could never approach on our own.
 
Our management believes that the government market imposes certain barriers to entry to new potential entrants. However, our management believes that the potential for recurring revenue generation, the data value appreciation that occurs over time, and low turnover upon establishment of government business all contribute to ideal long-term conditions that make this a good market for us to conduct direct sales.
 
The federal government boasts nearly 2,000 top-level .gov domains and 24,000 websites of varying purpose, design, navigation, usability and accessibility. Including the 50 states and all local government websites, there are over 600,000 government websites in the United States.
 
Potential additional market segments of focus include, but are not limited to:
 

· | Finance & Banking Institutions;
--+--------------------------------
· | Travel & Hospitality; 


6
-


· | Public & Private Transportation Companies; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Retail and Ecommerce Companies; 
· | Educational Institutions (K-12 and universities as a result of frequent and recent settlement agreements involving and structured by the Department of Justice);
· | Automotive; 
· | Food Services; and 
· | SaaS Providers. 

Marketing and Sales
 
In addition to direct sales with industry specialization and geographical diversification, we use strategic business partnerships and development referral partners, who maintain a long-standing successful track record in securing introductions with C-level executives and key stakeholders that directly influence the buying decision of our technology and services. As a proven means of breaking down barriers to entry and shortening sales cycles, these strategic relationships contribute to the success of our sales operation. Conveying the return on investment of our technology to our prospective clients is critical as a differentiator in our space. Success in all these efforts is not only critical in order to meet our sales objectives, but also raises market awareness of the Company’s products and brand.
 
The Company also attends selected accessibility and industry trade conferences, maintains memberships with key, industry-specific organizations, serves as subject matter experts within well-attended panels covering industry-related topics, leverages paid search engine optimization for those looking online to learn about or purchase accessibility products or services, and a variety of other conventional marketing and social marketing techniques.
 
Competition
 
Website accessibility can be achieved in one of two ways.
 
The traditional approach is called a “Shift Left” strategy. On the continuum of an organization’s software development life cycle, shift left refers to integrating universal design and accessibility testing and analysis as early on in a project (the design and development process) as possible. The idea is to prohibit inaccessible content from reaching production environments. For many businesses and organizations with the right resources and afforded a healthy amount of time, this is absolutely the right thing to do. Without a doubt, websites should be designed, developed, and created with web accessibility in mind. This is why AudioEye offers the Digital Accessibility Platform and provides resources for organizations seeking to empower internal stakeholders to become the subject matter experts. This approach, however, does little to assist organizations being sued for websites that are already live and public facing. No one has ever been sued for a website that was being built. By the thousands, per year, businesses are being sued because of the sites they have, today, and not the sites they are looking to build in the future.
 
This is where we come in. AudioEye makes websites accessible. In fact, we are proud to be the web accessibility company that revolutionized the way businesses and organizations achieve and maintain a sustainable path to digital inclusion. Our solution identifies and remediates accessibility issues with both automated and manual testing and engineering and provides continuous monitoring to ensure sites meet or exceed legal compliance with ADA-related laws and substantially conform with the WCAG, which is the internationally recognized benchmark used to ensure the needs of individuals of disabilities are addressed when it comes to creating and publishing websites and digital content.

Other competitive solutions are insufficient when it comes to actually achieving substantial conformance with WCAG and removing access barriers that may impede or limit access for individuals with disabilities. These tools include:
 

· | Automated Testing Tools. These tools are insufficient and not a viable solution. There are a vast number of automated testing tools. These solutions provide businesses that tend to have very little knowledge of the issues with insights into, approximately, 35% of the overall potential access barriers. Unfortunately, they do next to nothing to assist businesses in understanding true access barriers and may even provide misleading evidence (e.g. false positives) that further waste product stakeholders time (assuming the business even controls its website – i.e. many businesses rely on outsourced niche CMS providers, which leaves their hands tied when it comes to meeting compliance requirements). Further, and most importantly, these solutions do nothing to fix anything. At the very best, they offer potential insight to assist internal stakeholders with information as to how to find and potentially fix, up to only 35% of, the issues that are detected by the automated testing suite. The remaining issues require subject matter experts to uncover issues through manual accessibility (AT) testing. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Accessibility Toolbars. These tools are insufficient and not a viable solution. For as many automated testing tools that can be found in the marketplace, there are just about as many low-cost accessibility toolbars, many of which emulate the leading edge, industry-first web personalization tools that AudioEye supplies free with the Ally Managed Service. On their own, these solutions provide businesses with only incremental benefits that address a small percentage of potential access barriers. Automatic remediation (if any) narrowly addresses WCAG Success Criteria, which provides very little benefit for AT users, who are the ones filing lawsuits against businesses for non-compliance. This approach has worked well in countries outside of the U.S. as evidenced by the large number of international firms attempting to enter the market in the U.S. Until these tool providers achieve validation from U.S.-based security organizations and can pass stringent due diligence examinations, they face an uphill climb. Further, and more importantly, until these tool providers are able to securely and reliably deliver human-based remediation as delivered through their dynamic remediation technology, U.S. companies will see through their façade and/or gain very little benefit by incorporating and using these highly limited solutions.

 
In summary, our management believes that the Company’s technology and solutions will primarily compete against the following:
 

1. | Web Accessibility Assessment Technology Providers and Automated Testing Tools. There are a small number of Web Accessibility audit and tracking platform providers, but we do not believe their technology solutions offer the specific end-to-end services offered through the AudioEye Digital Accessibility Platform. Furthermore, their solutions are currently more standalone in that they are not combined with a cloud-based tool with a full suite of comparable assistive tools for end-users. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Web Accessibility Remediation Technology Providers. Currently, other technology providers that utilize technology to apply compliance remediation through a server-side technology do not effectively deploy human-deployed remediations, nor do they pair their solution with the full breadth of services offered through the AudioEye Ally Platform product suite, including, for example, assistive tools for end-users. These providers are therefore limited in their capacity to provide a fully inclusive user experience for the customers adopting the technology. 
3. | Web Accessibility Consulting Service Providers. There are a substantial number of consulting service providers in the Web Accessibility industry. Each generally provides an analysis of the various compliance issues associated with its clients’ websites. They ultimately provide resources and assistance in applying fixes and changes at the source. While we provide these services, we also provide tools that empower an end-to-end fully managed service, as well as tools that empower self-directed developers to fix issues without requiring source-code remediation.
4. | Cloud-Based Assistive Technology Providers and Accessibility Toolbars. There are other cloud-based assistive technology providers. However, they do not offer a reliable and trusted solution with compliance detection and remediation for users of existing, native assistive technologies, such as screen readers.

Competitive Strengths
 
Our management believes the following competitive strengths will enable our success in the marketplace:
 

· | Unique combination of technology and specialized managed service. Our management believes that AudioEye, unlike any other company in the marketplace, has addressed the problem of Web Accessibility, holistically, and has uniquely positioned itself to provide a combination of leading-edge technology and high-quality specialized managed service. Our one-of-a-kind, combined solution empowers our clients to provide the highest level of access and usability across their digital infrastructure, while reducing burden on finite IT resources, which leads to cost-savings and reduced time-to-market for our customers. Our management believes that the AudioEye solution allows our customers to focus not only on achieving compliance, but also on maintaining compliance throughout the life of the subscription and enabling a tangible and non-trivial return on investment – a true competitive advantage. This return on investment is derived from opening access to the approximately 15% of the population with a disability or physical limitation. This has allowed our clients to reach more customers, improve brand image, and build additional brand loyalty from their customers in a competitive manner.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Unique patented technology. First and foremost, AudioEye builds all its products with the primary goal of enhancing the user experience, in every way possible, regardless of the end-user’s individual disability or physical limitation. AudioEye is a marketplace technology leader providing what we believe to be unparalleled Web Accessibility solutions for our clients’ customers through our Ally Platform products. We own a unique patent portfolio comprised of six issued patents in the United States and we have additional U.S. patents pending. Our portfolio includes patents and pending patent applications in the United States with over 60 issued claims. 

 
Our current portfolio has established a foundation for building unique technology solutions that contribute to the way in which we differentiate ourselves from other competitors in the B2B Web Accessibility marketplace. We are actively pursuing the expansion of this portfolio to include a broad range of pertinent and novel concepts that AudioEye has employed (or is in the process of employing) for our growing client list. In this continued pursuit of expanding the capabilities of our technology and meeting the demands of our customers, AudioEye is committed to growing its IP portfolio.
 

· | Highly experienced inventors, technologists and product development team. Our team is comprised of experienced software, e-commerce, mobile marketing and Internet broadcasting developers and technologists that have worked together for over fifteen years. During their careers, this team has developed several technologies programs for Fortune 500 organizations; federal, state and local governments in the United States, and several leading organizations across the global marketplace.

Patent and Trademark Rights
 
We have a portfolio comprised of six approved patents in the United States, and we have received a notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a seventh patent. We also have several additional patents that are either pending or are being prepared for filing.
 
The patents have been extended and cover a period from 2002 through 2026. We have six issued patents and six registered trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
 
Legal Landscape and Government Regulation
 
Government regulation in the United States that affects the market and commercial potential for our products and services includes the Rehabilitation Act, the ADA, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 (“CVAA”), the Air Carrier Accessibility Act (“ACAA”), and various State Laws.
 
The Rehabilitation Act requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a federal department or agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public without disabilities. The federal government also requires vendors selling to the government be compliant under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, unless covered by a provable exception. Canada and the European Union have similar requirements.

The ADA was passed to ensure equal opportunity for people with disabilities. It applies to employment, transportation, state and local government services, and businesses that provide public accommodations or facilities.
 
Title II and Title III of the ADA prevent discrimination on the basis of disability in services, programs, and activities provided by public entities (Title II) and private entities considered to be places of public accommodation (Title III). Title II and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act continue to be actively enforced by the Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”), who has entered into hundreds of resolution agreements with School Districts and Education Institutions requiring conformance to WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria as managed and monitored through an OCR-validated Accessibility Auditor.
 
Under the previous administration, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) was in the process of formulating rules regarding the accessibility of websites and mobile applications. The DOJ had divided its rulemaking into two efforts: the first was intended to provide guidance to state and local entities to comply with Title II, and the second was intended to establish rules for private entities to comply with Title III. Under the new administration, the DOJ has placed the issuance of those rulemakings on the inactive list. However, we believe the absence of any rulemaking will only increase the prevalence of lawsuits filed by plaintiffs seeking issue resolution in continued pursuit of their civil rights as protected under ADA. According to a leading ADA law firm, Seyfarth Shaw, with over 2,258 federal lawsuits filed, federal ADA Title III lawsuits increased by 17% in 2018 due largely to Website Access Lawsuits. This trend is expected to increase in 2019.
 
Learn more at www.ada.gov.
 
Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Requires that federal agencies’ electronic and information technology is accessible to people with disabilities, including employees and the public.
 
The U.S. Government Access Board has updated the requirements to Section 508 compliance standards, commonly referred to as the “Section 508 ICT Refresh,” further formalizing the mandate to adhere to specific web accessibility best practices, namely those outlined under the WCAG, the international standards for web accessibility. Already, a growing number of legal mandates and recent settlements point to the WCAG 2.1 standards as well as making it a requirement to hire third-party Accessibility Subject Matter Experts to maintain an accessibility audit and provide certification – sources range from the DOJ, the U.S. Access Board, and the OCR.
 
For more information, visit www.section508.gov.
 
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act entitles individuals with disabilities to equal access to any program or activity that receives federal subsidy – this includes Web-based communications for educational institutions and government agencies.
 
In October 2010, the CVAA was enacted to update existing federal laws requiring communications and video programming accessibility and to fill in any current gaps in accessibility to ensure the full inclusion of people with disabilities in all aspects of daily living through accessible, affordable and usable communication and video programming technologies.
 
Per the Department of Transportation, the ACAA (49 U.S.C. 41705) prohibits discrimination by U.S. and foreign air carriers on the basis of physical or mental disability. The Department of Transportation, in interpreting and implementing the ACAA, has issued a rule setting forth the standards of service which air carriers are expected to provide to disabled individuals.


Beyond the federal level, many states have enacted accessibility laws and, going further, internationally, over 100 Governments have signed and ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
 
As an example, the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, among other things, prohibits discrimination based on disability. More recently, a new law enacted in California, Assembly Bill 434 State Web Accessibility, states that prior to July 1, 2019, each State Agency Director or its Chief Information Officer must post on the homepage of its agency a declaration that the site has been made accessible by meeting the WCAG standards.

Given the many government regulations in place and/or in process, actions must be taken for businesses to comply with best practices and international standards. This presents a significant business opportunity as more pressure is being put on businesses and organizations to improve the accessibility of their web environments. In addition, from a risk mitigation standpoint, it is best if they consistently and reliably track and demonstrate their level of conformance to these internationally recognized standards over time, the WCAG 2.1.
 
Employees
 
As of March 5, 2019, we had 65 full-time employees. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that relations with our employees are very good. We have a "People First" cultural value we aspire to every day. We have a sincere focus on developing each team member to allow the team member to grow professionally and personally during his or her time with AudioEye.
Corporate Information 
 
AudioEye, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation on May 20, 2005. On August 1, 2018, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to implement a reverse stock split in the ratio of 1 share for every 25 shares of common stock and to reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock from 250,000,000 to 50,000,000. As a result, 186,994,384 shares of the Company’s common stock were exchanged for 7,479,775 shares of the Company's common stock. Our financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 5210 East Williams Circle, Suite 750, Tucson Arizona, 85711, and our telephone number at that address is (866) 331-5324. We maintain a website at www.audioeye.com (this reference to our website is an inactive textual reference only and is not intended to incorporate our website into this report). We file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and make available, free of charge, on or through our website, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy and information statements and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. In addition, the SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov containing reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Information on the SEC’s website does not constitute part of this report. Our website also contains copies of our corporate governance guidelines, code of business conduct and ethics, related party transaction policy and whistleblower policy, and copies of the charters for our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee.
