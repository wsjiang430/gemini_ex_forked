Item 1. Business
Business Overview
 
Leader Capital Holdings Corp. is an early stage technology company that conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Leader Financial Group Limited, a Seychelles corporation incorporated on March 6, 2017 (“LFGL”), and JFB Internet Service Limited, a Hong Kong corporation incorporated on July 6, 2017 (“JFB”).
 
Through LFGL, we act as the service provider for a mobile application investment platform that is owned by JFB. The platform connects investors with financial service providers in an effort to sharpen operational efficiency and seeks to address customer demands for more innovative services. It is a ready-made application created to meet the needs of financial service providers, especially trust companies and insurance companies. The platform is customizable and each financial institution can adjust the platform to better suit their client’s needs.
 
Currently, our platform is being used by trust companies to help their clients review their asset portfolio(s) at anytime from anywhere. The investors can use their trust accounts to purchase a wide range of investment products, including regulatory insurance policies and registered funds through the JFB platform. In this way, the JFB platform can reduce the workload of customer service representatives. Investors can also use the JFB platform to make investment decisions in real-time and rapidly place investment orders, without having to e-mail, mail or fax documents to their investment advisor. Our investment platform is also well equipped with comprehensive and real-time information about financial markets.
 
With the JFB platform, investors can do the following:
 

● | keep track of their investment portfolio; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------
● | view insurance policy details; 
● | check their trust account balances; 
● | browse various financial products offered by the company; 
● | view the latest financial news; 
● | browse analyst reports from industry experts; 
● | customize their background and layout; and 
● | contact our online customer service team. 

 
Use of the JFB platform is currently free; however, we have an agreement with a third party whereby we have authorized the third party to use our investment platform and related applications until December 31, 2020 for a fee. In the future, the Company intends to generate additional revenue by developing a new, more comprehensive mobile application, with similar functions as the JFB platform, to offer to our clients for a fee.
 
Competition
 
Our market is competitive, and we expect competition in our market to increase as existing competitors enhance and expand their product and service offerings and as new participants enter the market. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profitability and loss of market share. We cannot ensure that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. Some of our customers and companies with which we have strategic relationships may also become competitors.
 
Many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources than we have. As a result, these companies may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services, or other incentives that we cannot match or offer. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond more quickly to new technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns. We believe they may also pursue and adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners. In addition, competitors with greater financial resources may make strategic acquisitions to increase their ability to gain market share or improve the quality or marketability of their products. Furthermore, we face challenges in selling our product to large companies in the process industries that have internally developed their own proprietary software solutions.

However, most of our competitors only provide direct services to a single company and investors can only choose that company’s products. The JFB platform differs in that it offers different products from different companies in one mobile application and allows for user customization. We believe this approach provides us with an advantage over many of our competitors.
 
Marketing
 
The JFB mobile application platform is marketed mainly through word of mouth. We rely on our clients and business contacts, such as insurance brokerage houses, real estate agent firms, social network groups, and securities firms to encourage their clients to download the JFB mobile application platform. Some of these professional firms do not currently have the resources to develop their own software to manage their clients, so they rely on the JFB mobile application platform to manage their clients, their clients’ assets and reduce their administrative workload. Thus, it is in their interest to encourage their clients to use the JFB mobile application platform.
Intellectual Property
 
We do not currently own any intellectual property.
 
Employees
 
As of November 15, 2019, the Company has five employees.
 
Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 22, 2017. Our principal executive office is located at Room 2708-09, Metropolis Tower, 10 Metropolis Drive, Hung Hom, Hong Kong.
Government Regulation and Approvals
 
The Company offers its clients a mobile application that allows their customers to review their asset portfolio(s) and communicate their investment decisions with our clients in real-time. The JFB mobile application platform is not a trading platform, broker dealer or exchange, and therefore does not expect to be subject to regulatory oversight by the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or other financial regulatory agencies. We are not aware of any governmental regulations or approvals required for the marketing or use of the JFB mobile application platform or the services provided.
Emerging Growth Company
 
The Company is an “emerging growth company”, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements of Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of stockholders on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
 
The Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates

We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (1) December 31, 2023, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total gross revenue of at least$1.07 billion, (3) the last day of our fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (which would occur if the market value of our equity securities that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter), or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three-year period.
 
To the extent that we continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years.
