ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Background
 
We are a medical device technology and software as a service (SaaS) company focused on enabling primary care physicians (PCP’s) to increase their revenues by providing them with relevant, value-based tools to evaluate and treat chronic disease as well as provide preventive care through reimbursable procedures. In some cases, the products we provide our physician clients will enable them to diagnose and treat patients with chronic diseases which they historically have referred to specialists, allowing them to increase their practice revenue. As part of our mission, we are providing PCPs with the software, training and devices necessary to allow them to treat their patients using value-based healthcare, informatics and algorithmic personalized medicine. Our digital healthcare, clinical decision support and point of care solutions also support non face to face remote patient and therapeutic monitoring, to address chronic care and preventive medicine and are reimbursable to the medical practice.
 
In November 2020, we began shipping AllergiEnd® diagnostic related products and immunotherapy treatments to PCPs in response to their requests based upon courses of treatment recommended for their patients building on the capabilities of QHSLab, our primary SaaS tool.
 
In June 2021, we announced that we had acquired the method patent, trademark and website associated with AllergiEnd®’s diagnostic and allergen immunotherapy product portfolio. The acquisition of the AllergiEnd® assets provides us the opportunity to more fully integrate and leverage our product portfolio across our marketing platform, customer relationships and cost structure.
 
Based on the success of PCPs using our Quality Health Score Lab Expert System (“QHSLab”) digital healthcare platform combined with the acquired AllergiEnd® product line, we intend to increase our revenues by charging physicians a monthly subscription fee for the use of QHSLab and soliciting additional PCPs to increase their revenues by using our proven revenue generating QHSLab and AllergiEnd® line of products. We also plan to introduce additional point of care diagnostics and treatments, and digital medicine programs that PCPs can use and prescribe in their practices. In all cases, PCPs will be paid under existing government and private insurance programs, based upon analyses conducted utilizing QHSLab and treatments provided as a result of such analyses.
 
Industry
 
The healthcare industry has yet to experience the improvements in outcomes, access, and cost-effectiveness that have transformed many other industries through the use of digital technologies. In an effort to address a worsening pandemic of chronic diseases associated with aging populations, technology companies are now contributing innovative solutions that enhance chronic and preventive care management through the structured capture, storage and analysis of large quantities of patient data, and remote monitoring digital applications to reduce the burden of care on healthcare systems.
 
Digital medicine products utilizing sophisticated hardware and software to capture, store, analyze and access patient data, can be used independently or in concert with pharmaceuticals, biologics, devices, or other products to optimize patient care and health outcomes. A key component of digital medicine is the analysis of raw patient data, including physiological and environmental signals or responses to digital health risk assessments to provide the physician with result-oriented output to support clinical decision making and better coordinate patient care and treatment.

Digital Therapeutics, that is, the use of digital medicine products to assess a patient’s state of health and monitor progress in response to recommended lifestyle changes, medication adherence and treatment regimens, is considered a treatment in its own right, and may be reimbursable depending upon a patient’s health condition and diagnosis, giving health-care providers an economic incentive to engage in digital healthcare. We intend to add features to our QHSLab platform which allow PCPs to engage in digital medicine for which they will be reimbursed.
 
Our Operating Model
 
Our mission is to enhance the quality of life of individuals and populations through physician-directed digital medicine and innovative, artificial intelligence (AI) enhanced preventive health technologies.

● | Value Based. The Company provides tools that enhance health care for patients while lowering costs to insurance providers and corporate America and allowing physicians to increase their practice revenues. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Patient Centered. Our products streamline the relationship between physicians and their patients, providing a high quality experience for patients, and increasing the value provided to them during care. 
● | Time Saving. Physicians can maximize face-to-face office visits and non-face-to-face patient education while generating additional revenue through reimbursable preventative services. 
● | Prevention Focused. Our products are designed to promote prevention, early detection, management, and reversal of chronic diseases. 

QHSLab Expert System
 
We have developed and are constantly upgrading our high-level, fully automated cloud-based SaaS system named the QHSLab which provides physicians and healthcare organizations with the ability to capture and store patient information electronically in a secure database. The patients’ data is analyzed by specific and proprietary algorithms, assisting the physician in making a diagnosis and prescribing a course of treatment and appropriate care coordination. We provided physicians at practices which use QHSLab with analytical tools to diagnose and treat allergies and asthma which allowed them to increase revenues by expanding the breadth of their practices. Our focus for the immediate future, is to increase the number of physicians utilizing the QHSLab platform, to charge users a monthly fee, to expand the number of diagnostic algorithms and health risk assessments incorporated into QHSLab and to add features which allow PCPs to engage in reimbursable forms of digital medicine, thereby enabling general practice physicians to increase their revenues.
 
Our QHSLab Expert System is capable of handling large quantities of data, without compromising security, accuracy or precision. We can set parameters to accommodate prospective client physician and healthcare organizations’ policies and easily deal with significant increases in user workload. Our cloud-based software and IT system scales to allow a virtually unlimited number of user sessions to be activated. By utilizing a set, well-known path built into our third-party ‘robust’ cloud server infrastructure our QHSLab is not only capable of scaling to a large number of users, but is also built on a globally-scalable architecture, allowing us to deliver high availability to users in just about any geographic region.
 
The importance of identifying particular health risks and the indicators of the risks to be identified vary between different healthcare settings and sectors. Some require psychological data while others require a detailed medical history and list of medications. The data collected and analyzed by our QHSLab and the feedback provided to a physician can be tailored to provide the physician with an individualized assessment tailored to his practice.
 
Advantages of the QHSLab Expert System
 
QHSLab has the potential to play the same role in behavioral medicine and lifestyle interventions that pharmacological interventions play in biological medicine. It will help physicians and healthcare organizations overcome barriers preventing adoption of behavioral and therapeutic change programs for health promotion and disease prevention through easy to use applications.

Through purposeful design, the QHSLab Expert System:
 

● | Conducts a comprehensive assessment of patient behaviors, lifestyle and disease risk; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Integrates into existing physician and healthcare interventions; 
● | Collects and compiles relevant, empirical data; 
● | Utilizes this information for decision making (both artificial and naturalistic); 
● | Accounts for individual differences yet is appropriate for whole populations; 
● | Provides guidelines for consistent decisions; 
● | Demonstrates flexibility by allowing new variables to be added; 
● | Requires relatively low-skilled IT involvement in assessment or patient program development; and 
● | Maximizes revenue by providing less costly ‘digital’ alternatives to face-to-face interactions. 

 
Our interventions are ideal for population-based approaches. We provide an efficient means of screening. Upon development, our interactive AI based programs will branch into in-depth assessment when a problem area is identified. QHSLab will include a large array of interventions that can be matched to individual user requirements.
 
QHSLab will be expanded to incorporate a wide variety of different digital healthcare intervention programs including allergies and asthma, mental health, musculoskeletal health and pain, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, sleep disorders, dietary assessments, weight loss and much more. Our AI driven approaches will range from patient treatment seeking interventions and motivational materials for participants in early stages of behavioral change to more detailed advice and support for participants in later stages of behavioral change. As a participant progresses (or regresses), different intervention materials will be available.
 
Our system will provide an automated recording device so that minimal amounts of progress can be detected and reinforced. Gathering data through automation provides an extensive empirical data base that can be used to both serve the participant and provide an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system. Since health risk prevention can be very expensive in terms of the resources required to provide services to all participants, QHSLab represents a far less costly alternative.
 
An article published December 28, 2021, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) titled ‘Assessment of an Interactive Digital Health–Based Self-management Program to Reduce Hospitalizations Among Patients With Multiple Chronic Diseases’ reported on the success achieved by physicians utilizing a research system similar to QHSLab. The randomized clinical trial found that “among participants who received the internet chronic disease management intervention, fewer were admitted to the hospital” and “digital health interventions supporting patient self-management and self-monitoring has the potential to augment primary care among patients with multiple chronic diseases and co-morbidities.”
 
Physicians are seeking preventive and chronic care management tools for their medical decision making and patient care, including non-face to face asynchronous interventions and easy to incorporate workflow digital screenings. Today, independent physicians and their practices desire digital health relationships that meet all their needs and those of their patients, instead of having to incorporate multiple limited services from numerous digital health companies. Physicians don’t have time to pick and choose among different digital health systems. QHSLab solves this problem especially for the independent primary care provider.
 
AllergiEnd®
 
The first point of contact for most allergy patients is their primary care doctor or pediatrician. There are approximately 60 million Americans affected by allergic disorders, yet there are fewer than 3,000 practicing Board Certified Allergists and approximately 2,400 Board Certified Otolaryngologists specializing in allergy or approximately 1 specialist for every 11,000 allergy sufferers. It is estimated that the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) allergists/immunologists will decline about 7 percent in coming years. Meanwhile, demand for the services these physicians provide is projected to increase by 35 percent over the foreseeable future.
 
Only a limited number of primary care physicians have sufficient training to diagnose and treat allergy-suffering patients in their offices. The primary care provider is managing many forms of chronic diseases today that in the past were in the specialist domain, while allergies have remained the exception. We believe there is a need to equip primary care physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurses with the ability to diagnose and treat allergy sufferers and that this need provides a strong economic opportunity for the Company.
 
The AllergiEnd® system empowers allergist primary care providers with means to test patients for a broad spectrum of allergens within the confines of their office, thereby enabling the physician to identify the specific cause of the patient’s allergies which can lead to targeted allergen immunotherapy treatment as opposed to merely masking symptoms with various anti-histamines. The product line consists primarily of a disposable, one-time use set of FDA cleared and patented skin test applicators and a unique patented test tray for use with the test applicators.

As part of our service, we provide physicians and their staff with the know-how and training in allergy screening via the QHSLab digital medicine platform, skin test confirmation of the particular allergen causing the allergy symptoms and targeted allergen immunotherapy necessary to enable the physician to desensitize positive allergic patients, thereby treating the cause of the allergies, not merely the symptoms. AllergiEnd® allergen immunotherapies are pharmacy compounded preparations provided by a contract pharmacy in response to prescriptions given by the treating physicians that slowly expose the patient to small doses of the allergen culprit, either via subcutaneous injections in the doctor’s office or through convenient at home sublingual (under the tongue) oral drops. This approach is similar, if not identical, to that used by allergists the world over for many years. This builds the body’s immune system to the allergens, thereby overcoming the patient’s excessive reaction to allergens that were previously causing allergy symptoms. Allergen Immunotherapy practiced safety is the only known method of treatment that leads to prolonged tolerance to the allergens causing the patient’s allergic chronic disease. In addition to enhancing the level of care doctors can provide their patients; the screening, testing and allergen immunotherapy are reimbursable under established CPT codes enhancing the physician’s practice and, in many instances, also providing a new cash pay alternative for physicians and their patients.
 
Q-Scale Psychological Emotional Wellbeing 
 
It has been suggested that nearly 75% of all medical office visits (to all types of healthcare providers) are related to stress, anxiety and depression.
 

● | “Q” stands for Quality of Life, and the Q-Scale measures a patient’s responses (or early “warning” signs) to questions regarding their sleep, stress, anxiety, worry, pain, and overall life satisfaction. Patients with high mental health risks are flagged for further screening during the same assessment. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Q-Scale is a digital health 10-item questionnaire designed to measure psycho-emotional factors in patients at risk of mental health issues.
 

● | Five categorical ratings are available for response to each item, ranging from “none of the time” to “all of the time.” If responses to the Q-Scale indicate potential mental health troubles, patients are directed to the Kessler 6 questions within the assessment to identify their risk of anxiety and depression for further clinical evaluation. Responses then categorize the patient as “at-risk” for mental health issues, including depression. Then the treating physician will be informed through a simple-to-read report of the need for more focused evaluation during their encounter with the patient. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
This assessment provides immediate feedback to patients while allowing for substantial reimbursements for physicians.
 

● | Patients are provided with a comprehensive, yet easy to interpret report based on their responses, providing supportive self-management strategies to improve their coping skills and wellbeing. The Q-Scale aligns with CPT code 96136, which is used when tests are administered by a physician or other qualified healthcare professional. It is defined as “psychological or neuropsychological test administration / scoring by a physician or other qualified healthcare professional, two or more tests, any method.” 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
For our physician customers, the product is time-saving, maximizing face-to-face office visits while generating additional revenue through reimbursement codes accepted by commercial payors, Medicare and Medicaid. From a patient perspective, Q-Scale promotes early detection and treatment of conditions potentially related to stress, anxiety, or depression, and increases the value provided to patients during their care.
 
Industry trends also reinforce the growing need for new and time-sensitive approaches for the treatment of mental health-related issues. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in five Americans will experience a mental illness in a given year. Also, one in 25 Americans will be impacted by a severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression. In addition, a recent study published by KFF, a non-profit organization focused on health-care issues, indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic recession have negatively affected many people’s mental health with up to 40% of people reporting anxiety and depressive-related symptoms.
 
Key aspects of the Q-Scale product include:
 
● Utilizes QHSLab’s cloud-based software and technology system that scales to allow a virtually unlimited number of user sessions to be activated and integrates into existing physician and healthcare interventions while collecting and compiling relevant, empirical data.
 
● Measures a patient’s responses, identifying early “warning” signs using questions regarding their sleep, stress, anxiety, worry, pain and overall life satisfaction. Patients determined to have high mental health risks are identified for further screening during the same assessment. Items in the Q-Scale have been deliberately written to emphasize normal psychological functioning in generally healthy patients, therefore it is a total population screening tool.
 
● If responses to the Q-Scale indicate potential mental health issues, patients are directed to the PHQ-9, GAD-7 and Kessler 6, a global measure of distress drawing from depressive and anxiety related symptomology. The treating physician is then alerted to the need for more focused evaluation during their encounter with the patient.
 
● Patients receive a post-assessment digital ‘feedback’ report and self-management strategies useful in addressing any items identified during the assessment.

Competition
 
The market for future point of care and software as a service solutions is highly competitive and characterized by rapid change. The success of our solutions will be contingent upon our ability to provide superior solutions and a strong value proposition for all potential customers and their patients. Many existing competitors are well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. It is likely that there will be new entrants into our market, some of which may become significant competitors. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect the competitive environment to be and remain intense. We currently face competition from a range of companies, including Teledoc Health, Virta Health Corp., Omada Health, Inc., Glooko, Inc., Hello Heart Inc., Lyra Health, Inc., Onduo LLC, Lark Health, DarioHealth Corp and Noom, Inc., some of which market direct to the consumer, bypassing physicians.
 
Our main competitors fall into the following categories:
 
● private and public companies that offer specific chronic disease products and services, such as solutions for allergies and asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and certain addictions or behavioral health conditions;
 
● large enterprises focused on the healthcare industry, including initiatives and partnerships launched by companies which may offer or develop products or services with features or benefits that overlap with our proposed future solutions; and
 
● digital health device manufacturers that facilitate the collection of data but offer limited interpretation, feedback or guidance.
 
Many of our current competitors enjoy greater resources, recognition, deeper customer relationships, larger existing customer bases, and more mature intellectual property portfolios than we do currently.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Although certain of our current software applications and pioneering methods, as well as those developed in the future, will be eligible for patent and trademark protection, we believe that the costs of maintaining and enforcing such intellectual property rights may not afford us a competitive advantage and for the immediate future we intend to rely primarily on maintaining the secrecy of our proprietary information.

Government Regulation
 
The healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the manner in which we and the PCPs which use our products provide and bill for services and collect reimbursement from governmental programs and private payors, our contractual relationships with vendors and clients, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Of particular importance are:

● | the federal physician self-referral law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the federal Anti-Kickback Act; 
● | the criminal healthcare fraud provisions of HIPAA; 
● | the federal False Claims Act; 
● | reassignment of payment rules that prohibit certain types of billing and collection by companies which do business with PCPs; 
● | similar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims issues; 
● | state laws that prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine; and 
● | laws that regulate debt collection practices as applied to our debt collection practices. 

 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert management’s attention from our business.
 
The FDA issued a Finalized Guidance on medical mobile applications (“Apps”). The FDA determined that certain Apps may meet the definition of a medical device because they provide the user with certain biologic information. The Guidance contains an appendix that provides examples of mobile apps that may meet the definition of a medical device but for which the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion. These mobile apps may be intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Even though these mobile apps may meet the definition of a medical device, the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for these mobile apps because they pose lower risk to the public. Based on our understanding of the Guidance, although there can be no guarantee, we believe our QHSLab services will eventually be subject to regulatory requirements because such services seem to fall within the statutory examples of medical devices with respect to which the FDA intends to monitor compliance with applicable regulations. Although many of the Apps described in the Guidance have been in use for an extended period of time, the impact they have had on the need for patient visits to a physician and thus, on the use of our products, has not been determined.
 
Employees
 
As of March 29, 2023, we had four employees devoting full-time services to the Company, all of whom were engaged in direct sales and operations. In addition, we engage independent entities and consultants that provide programming services, Quality Management System development, Marketing and Medical Consulting & Advisory services. We believe that our relationships with our employees and consultants are good.
