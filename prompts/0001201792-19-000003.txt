This Item 1 of our Annual Report contains a “Company Overview” section that provides information about our subsidiary institutions, reporting segments, our history, the postsecondary educational market, competition, competitive strengths, strategic approach, executive officers, seasonality and available information. Item 1 also contains a section entitled “Our Institutions” that provides institution specific information regarding each of our two subsidiary institutions, and a “Regulatory Environment” section that provides information on some of the postsecondary educational regulations that impact us.
COMPANY OVERVIEW
Subsidiary Institutions
Our institutions of higher learning offer programs designed to help students advance in their current occupation, or prepare for their next career, and develop the competencies that enable them to make meaningful contributions to their profession and society. Our wholly-owned operating subsidiary institutions include:

• | American Public University System, Inc., or APUS, provides online postsecondary education to approximately 81,400 adult learners. APUS is an accredited university system with a history of serving the academic needs of the military, military-affiliated and public service communities through two brands: American Military University, or AMU, and American Public University, or APU.

APUS offers 110 degree programs and 109 certificate programs in diverse fields of study, with a particular focus on those relevant to today’s job market and emerging fields. Fields of study include business administration, health science, technology, criminal justice, education and liberal arts, as well as national security, military studies, intelligence, and homeland security. APUS has regional accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission, or HLC, and several of its academic programs have specialized accreditations granted by industry governing organizations.
APUS is committed to providing quality, relevant, accessible, affordable, and student-focused higher education to a diverse student population. In addition, the institution seeks to provide professional and workforce development solutions through partnerships with corporations and industry associations. Although APUS’s focus has expanded, the institution continues to have an emphasis on serving the military and veteran communities. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 55% of APUS’s students self-reported that they served in the military on active duty at the time of initial enrollment and approximately 14% of APUS’s students self-reported being a military veteran.

• | National Education Seminars, Inc., which we refer to as Hondros College of Nursing, or HCN, provides nursing education to approximately 2,100 students at five campuses in Ohio to serve the needs of the nursing and healthcare communities. HCN offers a Diploma in Practical Nursing, or PN, an Associate Degree in Nursing, or ADN, and a newly offered Associate Degree in Medical Laboratory Technology, or MLT. The campuses are located in the suburban areas of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton and Toledo. HCN will begin enrolling students into its MLT Program, with classes starting in April 2019 at its Cincinnati and Columbus campuses. HCN voluntarily discontinued new enrollments in its online Registered Nurse to Bachelor of Science in Nursing program, or RN-to-BSN Program, subsequent to the start of the July 2018 term. At that time, there were 65 students enrolled in the program. Students currently enrolled in the RN-to-BSN Program may elect to complete the program at HCN or transfer to another institution, including APUS.

HCN is nationally accredited by the Accrediting Bureau for Health Education Schools, or ABHES, and HCN’s locations and programs are approved by the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools. Portions of the PN and ADN Programs are online. HCN’s PN and ADN Programs are approved by the Ohio Board of Nursing, the PN Program is accredited by the National League for Nursing Commission for Nursing Education Accreditation, or NLN CNEA, and the MLT Program is currently seeking accreditation by the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Science, or NAACLS.

Our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased 0.5% to $297.7 million from $299.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 21.3% to $25.6 million from $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Financial information regarding each of our reporting segments, including information regarding segment revenue, net income and total assets for each of the last three fiscal years, can be found in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report; financial information is reported in this Annual Report in “Selected Financial Data,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 
In November 2018, HLC approved APUS’s application for a change in structure related to APUS’s proposal to enter into a shared services model with APEI and we entered into an intercompany agreement to implement the shared services model. As required by HLC policy and ED regulation, HLC will conduct a focused site visit that is currently scheduled for late May 2019.
Postsecondary Education Market Characteristics and Opportunities

The postsecondary education market in the United States is large, with over 4,000 institutions, diverse in its business models, and fragmented such that no one institution has a significant market share. Most postsecondary institutions, including for-profit postsecondary institutions, regardless of where they are located, how they are organized, and who they serve, face significant challenges, including:

• | a continued focus on the cost of a college education and the resulting impact on access;


• | concerns over the high level of college student indebtedness;


• | questions from lawmakers, the media, potential students and others about the quality of academic programs and the ability to translate the value of a postsecondary education into economic mobility;


• | competition from lower cost alternatives and from non-traditional competitors, such as those offering competency-based education, or CBE, programs, coding bootcamps, micro-credentials, and other alternative educational paths;


• | the importance of preparing students with relevant skills to work in new and rapidly changing industries and respond to technological change;


• | the need to support employers in efforts to optimize and advance their workforce; and


• | addressing the needs of students who are balancing education with other demands on their time.


Despite these challenges, post-secondary institutions, and the credentials they grant, have an important role to play in enabling social and economic mobility. Approximately 35 million U.S. residents have college credit but no degree. According to a 2018 report by the Lumina Foundation, only approximately 47% of Americans ages 25 to 64 have attained a post-secondary degree or certificate. The Lumina Foundation notes that four out of five jobs lost during the period from 2007 to 2009 were those that only required a high school education or less, showing the importance of degree attainment. Indeed, the Lumina Foundation projects that two-thirds of all jobs will require a post-secondary education by 2020.
Institutions who predominantly serve adult learners must address the particular needs of that population. According to the Lumina Foundation, approximately 38% of students enrolled in U.S. degree granting institutions are over the age of 25. Within this age group, approximately 86% of enrolled students are working adults and approximately 57% attend a university part-time. Today’s adult learners, whether military or civilian, are often working with extended or irregular work schedules, have family obligations, travel or relocate frequently, and have limited financial resources. 
With nearly 2.2 million active duty military and reservists, we believe the U.S. military community will continue to be an important market segment for online education. Because of their particularly irregular schedules, frequent deployments and access to tuition assistance funding, we believe service members will continue to seek respected universities that provide military-focused support services coupled with an online curriculum and flexible scheduling. We believe service members are particularly interested in post-secondary credentials that offer both career advancement and preparation for employment outside 
2

of the military. As part of their longstanding tradition, military leaders often encourage service members to use their earned education benefits, and to enhance their qualifications for purposes of the military’s compensation, promotion, assignment, and performance systems.
The Department of Defense, or DoD, uniform tuition assistance policy offers active duty, National Guard and reserve component service members a variety of education and financial aid options. Additionally, veterans (and certain service members) are entitled to educational benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA. For more information, refer to “Our Institutions - Sources of Student Financing” and “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements.”
We believe that military veterans represent another important market segment for online education. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that there were 1.6 million veterans aged 18 to 35 and another 4.3 million veterans aged 35 to 54 in 2017. Furthermore, of the 9.1 million veterans aged 18 to 64, approximately 76% are part of the labor force, but only approximately 29% have a bachelor’s degree or higher. We believe that our military heritage, affordability, and online offerings are attractive to veterans in the pursuit of career advancement and employment outside of the military. Veterans with dependents pursuing a program of education on a more than half-time basis at an on-campus location are eligible for a monthly housing allowance equal to the basic allowance for housing available to service members who are at a military pay grade E-5, or $1,650.00 per month. Veterans pursuing a program of education solely through distance education on a more than half-time basis are eligible to receive half of that monthly housing allowance, or $825.00 per month.
Elected and private-industry leaders are heavily promoting new policies and campaigns to facilitate the hiring of veterans, supporting a transition from military service to the workforce and stimulating demand for online education. As these policies lower barriers to non-military jobs and facilitate veteran-owned businesses winning federal contracts, online universities offer valuable educational opportunities for constituents regardless of where they live, work or learn.
 On a national level, the expanding need for healthcare coupled with a nursing shortage is driving demand for nursing education. Job opportunities for licensed practical nurses and registered nurses are expected to grow faster than the average growth for all occupations, or approximately 12%, between 2016 and 2026, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2018-19 Edition. The demand for nurses in Ohio is similar to national demand: job opportunities for licensed practical nurses and registered nurses in Ohio are expected to grow 9.5% and 14.2% through 2026, respectively, according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services’ 2026 Ohio Job Outlook report. However, despite the anticipated growth in job opportunities, over 64,000 qualified applications were not accepted by entry-level baccalaureate programs at nursing schools in 2016, according to a 2017 report from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing. These statistics suggest there may be unmet demand from qualified students for nursing educational programs.
U.S. employers are increasingly reporting significant gaps between required job skills and the current capabilities of their workforce. In a 2018 survey on behalf of CareerBuilder, the Harris Poll found that 45% of human resource managers surveyed had jobs they could not fill because they could not find qualified talent. Furthermore, 58% reported that they had jobs that were open for 12 weeks or longer. Working adults also recognize the need to be lifelong learners. Udemy’s 2018 Skills Gap Report found that 84% of workers surveyed said that they believe there is a skills gap in the U.S. and 72% thought skills needed for their jobs will change. A tight labor market is also contributing to the need for more skilled workers. High-skill occupations, defined as those where at least 80% of online job postings for that position request a bachelor’s degree or higher, have 25% more openings than available workers, according to Burning Glass Technologies’ report Different Skills, Different Gaps: Measuring & Closing the Skills Gap, March 2018. This report also noted a need for improved alignment between educators and employers, and a rapidly changing labor market. We believe a growing number of employers and professional associations will seek partnerships with academic institutions to advance the skills and productivity of their workforce through higher education and training programs.

Competition
Within the postsecondary education market, APUS competes primarily with not-for-profit public and private two-year and four-year colleges as well as other for-profit schools, particularly those that offer online learning programs. We believe APUS’s primary competitors include: Arizona State University, Capella University, DeVry University, Grand Canyon University, Purdue Global, Southern New Hampshire University, Strayer University, University of Maryland University College, University of Phoenix, and flagship and mid-size state universities offering degree programs online.  
We believe that the competitive factors in the U.S. postsecondary education market include:

• | quality of the academic program, including alignment to high growth sectors of the job market;

3


• | affordability;


• | breadth of degree offerings;


• | flexibility in delivery models;


• | frequency of course or program starts;


• | experience of faculty members engaged in the practice of their fields;


• | level of support for student success;


• | reputation among prospective students, employers, and other stakeholders;


• | effectiveness of marketing efforts in attracting college-ready students; and


• | track record of strong compliance.

HCN’s programs are largely offered as campus-based programs to residents in the geographic areas surrounding its campuses. In these geographic areas, HCN competes with other schools offering similar programs, including for-profit and not-for-profit public and private colleges. Because of its relatively local focus, HCN’s competitive environment is impacted by various factors that are specific not only to Ohio but also to the particular areas of Ohio where HCN’s campuses are located, including local supply and demand dynamics for nurses and nursing schools, and for MLT Programs. HCN’s results are also therefore more susceptible to the actions of single competitors than the results of an institution that draws from a broader geographical area would be. 
In the United States, student enrollment declined in the fall of 2018 by 1.7% at postsecondary institutions participating in Title IV programs and 15.1% among four-year for-profit institutions, as compared to the same period the previous year. This represented the seventh straight annual decline, measured semi-annually. Should this trend continue, our institutions could face increased competition as fewer students pursue postsecondary education and the capacity at postsecondary degree-granting institutions increases. Furthermore, we anticipate increased competition from post-secondary institutions as they continue to increase the number of online degree programs and develop more non-traditional programs for working adult students. 
In recent years, other institutions have started providing non-traditional, credit-bearing, and non-credit-bearing education programs without charge or at a low cost. We have also observed an increase in institutions offering CBE programs, which permit students to control their own pace and progress in a program by demonstrating that they have achieved certain skills or knowledge rather than by earning credit hours. Additionally, non-traditional competitors, such as entities providing coding bootcamps and micro-credentials, are offering new alternative educational paths. ED has also signaled its support for non-traditional programs’ participation in the Title IV programs.
Most public institutions are aided by substantial government subsidies. Public and private not-for-profit institutions benefit from government and foundation grants, tax-exempt status, tax-deductible contributions, and other financial resources not widely available to for-profit institutions. Many public competitors also benefit from longstanding name recognition and are able to directly recruit students in a more cost-effective manner than we can, especially in their local markets.
Increased competition for college-ready students has led to an increase in the cost of advertising in certain marketing channels. Continued increases in the cost of advertising may adversely impact our ability to attract college-ready students and/or increase our student acquisition costs. Moreover, institutions who charge higher tuition than APUS are generally in a position to make larger investments in marketing, specifically in student acquisition.

For more information on competition within the postsecondary education market, refer to “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Attracting and Retaining Students.”
Competitive Strengths
While many institutions are struggling to determine how to meet the needs of today’s students, both APUS and HCN have, since their founding, been successfully serving busy students, both civilian and military, who are often balancing work and other obligations with school, and living expenses with the cost of education.
The sources of our institutions’ competitive strengths include: 

• | Academic Relevance and Excellence. Both APUS and HCN offer programs aligned to areas of high growth in the job market as supported by data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and non-governmental organizations. This is particularly true in the healthcare, technology and business sectors, and in cybersecurity, nursing, and health information management programs. APUS also offers a liberal arts curriculum that develops the soft skills in demand by employers. APUS utilizes Industry Advisory Councils, to evaluate APUS’s current curriculum and inform the career relevance of programs and degrees. This facilitates efforts to connect APUS’s curriculum to the industries and the

4

students it serves and to deliver a high-quality academic product. The depth and breadth of APUS’s program offerings are designed to effectively address the diverse needs of students who enter into education programs with vastly different educational and career backgrounds and goals. Similarly, HCN focuses on educational relevance and excellence by hiring experienced nurses and other industry professionals as faculty members while enhancing student services to assist students with courses, labs, and clinical offerings. HCN’s faculty includes individuals with research experience and specialized nursing credentials. HCN has invested in an innovative concept-based curriculum and simulation labs to enhance the student learning experience and improve student success. Our institutions are committed to continually assessing and enhancing our academic programs and our student services to offer a high-quality education and facilitate successful outcomes for our students and graduates.

• | Affordable Tuition. Affordable tuition has been a priority of APUS since its founding, when APUS set tuition to align with tuition assistance programs available to members of the military. Today, tuition at APUS remains among the lowest in the four-year for-profit sector. APUS’s low tuition rates mean that its students are not required to take on as much debt as they might at another institution. The combined tuition and fees at APUS are generally less expensive for undergraduate and graduate students than the average in-state cost at a public university. APUS’s low tuition and fees, in combination with APUS’s undergraduate book grant that is provided to all undergraduate students, result in significant savings for students. APUS has provided approximately $137 million in book grant savings to undergraduate students since 2001. Tuition and fees at HCN are also designed to be affordable and competitive with those of similar institutions offering the same level of flexibility, accessibility, and student experience.


• | Market Leader In the Military Market. APUS traces its roots to AMU, which was founded in 1991 as a distance-learning, graduate-level institution for military officers seeking an advanced degree in military studies. Since its founding, APUS has gradually broadened its focus to include other military communities, veterans, public service, and certain other non-military communities with a focus on a broad purpose of “educating those who serve.” Today, APUS is a market leader among the active duty military professionals and is listed as the top provider of post-secondary education to active duty service members using DoD tuition assistance. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 55% of APUS’s students self-reported that they served in the military on active duty at the time of initial enrollment.


• | Flexible Delivery and Frequent Entry Points, Focused on Adult Learners. APUS designs courses and programs specifically for online delivery. APUS recruits and prepares its faculty exclusively to deliver online instruction. Because students are located worldwide, APUS focuses on providing asynchronous, interactive education to students that fits their busy lives. APUS offers monthly starts, giving students the opportunity to begin their studies at a time that works for them. Our academic support offerings, from advising and mentoring to library services and career planning, are individualized to students’ needs, designed to support them at each step of their education journey and in a format that works best for them. HCN offers programs that accommodate working adults by offering blended online and in-person courses for the PN and ADN Programs, as well as daytime and evening/weekend options at convenient campus locations.

Strategic Approach
In an effort to grow revenue and improve our financial performance, we are employing strategies to accomplish the following goals: 

• | Increasing Enrollment at APUS. Student enrollment at APUS has declined in recent periods. Stabilizing student enrollment at APUS is a priority. We plan to continue developing and executing strategies and initiatives aimed at increasing enrollment of college-ready students and further improving student retention. This may include seeking additional and expanding existing academic partnerships, with a focus on healthcare and community colleges, and launching new marketing initiatives including in the business-to-business space, as well as reengineering various enrollment management processes for more efficient student on-boarding and improved customer service.


• | Further Improve Student Outcomes and Produce Work-Ready Graduates. We are focused on attracting applicants who are prepared for the rigors of higher education and capable of successfully completing courses and graduating from our programs, ready to excel in their chosen fields. We also provide services designed to improve student persistence, increase the level of engagement and collaboration in the classroom, and deliver interventions designed to help students succeed.


• | Further Increase Alignment to Job Market Needs. Our institutions will continue exploring opportunities to enhance degree offerings to meet emerging needs and marketplace demands, with a focus on fields of study exhibiting higher than average job growth and new degree programs that are relevant to the workplace. Our institutions will also

5

continue to consider alternatives and non-traditional offerings, including corporate training and CBE programs aligned to the job market and requiring less time and expense to complete, possibly including through acquisitions of training or corporate learning companies serving high growth industries such as healthcare, technology and STEM fields.

• | Add New Campus Locations and Programs at HCN. Given the persistent gap between demand for nurses, medical and lab technicians and technologists, and the supply of qualified graduates of nursing and healthcare schools, we will continue to pursue both organic and inorganic growth opportunities for HCN. HCN will continue exploring opportunities to add campus locations, aligned with accreditor requirements, to meet the needs of students and marketplace demands, as well as new nursing and healthcare education programs, such as the MLT Program. To complement these efforts, we may also seek opportunities to expand through acquisition of nursing schools or other organizations focused on healthcare education.


• | Utilize Innovative Education Technology. At APUS, we provide a personalized online learning environment that leverages existing and proprietary technologies, as well as emerging technologies, for the purpose of enhancing student services, classroom instruction, learning outcomes and the overall student experience. We utilize various technologies to encourage student persistence and engagement with an emphasis on the mobile experience. We also operate an online social platform that addresses learning and employment-related needs of particular professional verticals relevant to the military and public service communities. Our intention is to deliver a next-generation student experience from point of inquiry to graduation and beyond, leveraging enhanced levels of personalization in order to address student expectations informed by market-leading customer experiences online.


• | Maintain Our Leading Position in the Military Market and Expand Our Presence in the Veteran Market. APUS has focused on the needs of the military community since its founding as AMU. The combination of our online model, focused curriculum, and outreach to military and veterans has enabled APUS to maintain a leadership position against more established institutions, many of which are traditional schools offering on-campus instruction that have served the military market for longer periods. We remain firmly committed to providing exceptional service and support to the military, military-affiliated, and veteran communities.


• | Increase APUS’s Share of the Civilian Market. APUS designs its curriculum to be broadly relevant to adult learners. APUS is particularly responsive to learners in public service communities, including public safety, intelligence and security professions. Today’s adult learners, regardless of their specific career requirements, are looking for a highly tailored educational experience that prepares them for success. We believe APUS’s academic offerings are attractive options for students seeking high quality, affordable, and flexible programs.


• | Expand Strategic Partnerships. Our institutions partner with corporations, government agencies, professional associations, and non-profit organizations to support their professional and workforce development initiatives. APUS provides more than 200 partner organizations with a range of services to maximize strategic workforce development goals, including tailored learning programs, dedicated client services, admissions support, custom program webpages, direct payment options for eligible institutions, and tuition grants. HCN partners with more than 30 healthcare facilities and community partners, through corporate and local agreements, to provide clinical experiences for HCN students, meet partners’ workforce needs, and work collaboratively to chart the future of nursing education in a community advisory capacity.

To support growth in our existing businesses and to diversify our business model, we will continue to assess and pursue strategic investments and acquisitions. Our investment and acquisition strategy includes a focus on investing in nursing and healthcare education as well as investing in companies that bridge postsecondary education to employment, to improve economic mobility for adult learners, in particular those in the military, national security and public service communities, through a combination of educational offerings and workforce-related solutions.
For additional information regarding our investments and acquisitions, please refer to the “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report.

Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations
Our quarterly results fluctuate and, therefore, the results in any quarter may not represent the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or full year. Our revenue and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal or other variations in our enrollments. Our student population also varies as a result of new enrollments, graduations, student attrition, the success of our marketing programs, and other reasons that we cannot always anticipate. We expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of these factors. 
Available Information About Us

APEI was incorporated in Delaware in 2002, as the successor to a Virginia corporation incorporated in 1991. Our website is www.apei.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

OUR INSTITUTIONS
We provide postsecondary education through two subsidiary institutions, APUS and HCN. Our institutions are licensed or otherwise authorized by state authorities, or are in the process of obtaining such licenses or authorizations, to offer postsecondary education programs to the extent the institutions believe such licenses or authorizations are required, and are certified by the U.S. Department of Education, or ED, to participate in student financial aid programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, or Title IV.
American Public University System
APUS is based in Charles Town, West Virginia and has regional accreditation from HLC. APUS traces its roots to AMU, which was founded in 1991 as a distance-learning, graduate-level institution for military officers seeking an advanced degree in military studies. APUS has gradually broadened its focus to include other military communities, veterans, public service, and certain other non-military communities with a focus on a broad purpose of “educating those who serve.” In 2002, APUS was organized into a university system with two components: AMU and APU. AMU is focused on educating students from the military, national security, military- affiliated and public service communities. APU is focused on educating career-focused working adults with an emphasis on educating professionals working in public service related communities. APUS is an online institution of higher learning, which we believe is well-suited to its students, especially its military, public service and working adult students, who serve in positions requiring extended and irregular work schedules, are on call for rapid response missions, participate in extended deployments and exercises, travel or relocate frequently, balance family and work demands and may be single parents with limited financial resources. Many APUS students have significant prior education and career experiences; 87% are working adults and the average age of its students is 33. APUS is designed to serve those students with tailored offerings to support them in successfully reaching their individual goals.

Although APUS’s focus has broadened, it continues to have an emphasis on its relationship with the military community. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 55% of APUS’s students self-reported that they served in the military on active duty at the time of initial enrollment. The remainder of APUS’s students are military-affiliated professionals (such as veterans, reservists or National Guard members), public service professionals (such as law enforcement personnel or other first responders) and other civilians (such as military spouses and working adult students).

In addition to degree programs, APUS offers 109 certificate programs. APUS’s certificate programs generally require a minimum of 18 credit hours and focus on a particular component of a broader degree program. Students may earn either discrete certificates or certificates in combination with work toward a degree program. APUS also offers several “Learning Tracks” comprised of a two-week orientation course about online learning and three academic courses in a related area of interest. A Learning Track allows students to pursue a course of study without having to commit to a degree or certificate program. In the first quarter of 2017, APUS launched Momentum, its CBE Program. CBE focuses on the achievement of knowledge and skills, providing a more flexible degree path to non-traditional students seeking an alternative to prevailing schedule and tuition constraints. The four CBE programs, in which enrollment is currently limited, include Retail Management, Criminal Justice, Emergency and Disaster Management, and Fire Science. Two additional CBE programs remain in development.
 For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, 24% of APUS students were enrolled in security and global studies programs, 24% in business, and 22% in arts and humanities, with the remainder of students in science, technology, education 
9

and math, health sciences, and education programs. During that period, 58% of students were enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program, 17% in an associate degree program, 16% in a master’s degree program, and 9% in certificate or other programs.
Student Recruitment and Marketing

APUS’s relationship-based marketing strategy focuses on building long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with organizations and individuals in the military, military-affiliated and public service communities. We rely on outreach teams, which serve these communities and foster long-standing relationships, as the core of this strategy. We believe APUS’s reputation as a trusted educator positions APUS as a respected institution among certain federal and private sector employers. These relationships, as well as APUS’s student and alumni networks, also cultivate personal referrals. We believe that this relationship-based marketing approach enables APUS to achieve lower student acquisition costs than otherwise would be achieved if it focused more heavily on traditional media advertising.
APUS supplements relationship-based marketing with multichannel, data-driven marketing campaigns to create greater brand awareness, particularly for academically prepared potential students outside the military, military-affiliated, and public service communities. In these campaigns, APUS utilizes, among other marketing channels, digital marketing channels such as organic and paid search, APUS owned and external content and social marketing communities, linear and digital TV advertising, radio advertising, and print advertising. Increased competition in paid marketing channels has resulted in higher advertising costs in certain marketing channels and could lead to increased student acquisition costs. To better manage costs and focus marketing efforts on prospective student audiences most likely to matriculate and succeed, APUS put in place tools to provide new insights connecting individual student performance data with third-party audience insights and the marketing touch points that attracted them. APUS is using these insights and other highly-personalized approaches to improve future decisions with respect to marketing mix allocation, audience targeting, new initiatives, relevant messaging, and creative decisions, as well as to more effectively and deeply leverage platform tools that support scalable advertising development, delivery and testing.
APUS also provides more than 200 partner organizations with a range of services to maximize strategic workforce development goals, including dedicated client services, admissions support, custom program webpages, direct payment options for eligible institutions, and tuition grants.

APUS continues to work to enhance the student learning experience to attract students who are more likely to persist and succeed in its programs, and will continue to work to identify and implement potential changes and initiatives that will more effectively attract and enroll more college-ready students on average. Such initiatives may include altering admissions standards, which may have an adverse effect on APUS’s enrollment and our financial condition. For additional information on the risk factors associated with such initiatives and the APUS admissions process please refer to “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business.”
Student Body and Enrollment
The student body of APUS consists of approximately 81,400 enrolled students, most of whom hold full-time employment. Student enrollment is defined as the number of unique active students, including those who take an approved leave of absence for up to two years, who have reached the eighth day of their first course or who have completed at least one course within the last 12 months for which a grade was received.
APUS is focused on identifying potential changes and initiatives that will more effectively support its students and help improve those students’ educational outcomes, including through faculty engagement initiatives and co-curricular initiatives to increase the level of engagement and collaboration in the classroom and strengthen the bond between APUS and its students. Improved engagement is an important element in APUS’s goal of retaining qualified students.
Accreditation
APUS has institutional accreditation from HLC, a regional institutional accrediting agency recognized by ED. The status and meaning of this accreditation is described more fully below in “Regulatory Environment - Accreditation.” The next comprehensive evaluation for reaffirmation of accreditation is scheduled for the 2020-2021 academic year.
In addition to accreditation by HLC, certain programs offered by APUS have received specialized accreditations or professional recognition. For example, the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs, or ACBSP, accredits 21 different academic programs, including the following:
•Associate of Science, Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Accounting;
10

•Associate of Arts, Bachelor and Master of Business Administration;
•Associate of Arts and Bachelor of Arts in Hospitality Management;
•Associate of Arts, Bachelor of Arts, and Master of Arts in Management; 
•Associate of Arts in Real Estate Studies; 
•Associate of Arts and Bachelor of Arts in Retail Management; 
•Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in Reverse Logistics Management; 
•Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in Entrepreneurship;
•Bachelor of Arts in Marketing; and
•Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in Transportation and Logistics Management.
In addition to the general ACBSP accreditation, our Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Accounting hold specialized accounting accreditation from ACBSP. 
The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) accredits the Bachelor and Masters of Science in Nursing program. In addition, APUS has obtained professional recognition for its program concentrations in Human Resources from the Society for Human Resource Management, for certain courses in the Sports and Health Sciences program from the American Sport Education Program for Bronze Level Certification and the National Academy of Sports Medicine Performance Enhancement Specialist, for the Information Systems Security program from the National Security Agency - Information Assurance Courseware Evaluation, and for certain courses in the Human Development and Family Studies program from the National Council on Family Relations for the Certified Family Life Educator. 
Our Master of Public Health program holds accreditation from the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH). In addition, the International Fire Service Accreditation Congress (IFSAC) has accredited five APUS programs, including:
•Associate of Science in Fire Science;
•Bachelor of Science in Fire Science Management; 
•Bachelor and Master of Arts in Emergency and Disaster Management; and
•Dual Master of Arts in Emergency and Disaster Management and Homeland Security.
Student Admissions 
APUS welcomes prospective students to apply for admission at any time through an online application process. The current qualification for most undergraduate programs is a high school diploma or General Education Development certificate. Applicants for graduate programs must hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited U.S. institution or an equivalent foreign institution. Certain programs may have additional admissions standards and restrictions. 
In April 2017, APUS continued to strengthen its verification process by implementing new procedures for prospective non-military students, an effort that originated in April 2015 with the implementation of a requirement for prospective students to complete a free, noncredit admissions assessment. APUS has made multiple changes to the assessment process since its original implementation and may further modify it in the future in order to better identify college-ready students. For example, in July 2017, APUS implemented a process requiring enhanced certification of prospective non-military students’ prior transcripts. These initiatives require significant time, energy and resources, and if our efforts are not successful, they may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Even if these initiatives successfully lead to the identification and enrollment of students who are likely to succeed and improving student experience, they could result in adverse impacts on APUS enrollments.
Cost of Attendance and Financial Aid
We believe that APUS’s ability to offer affordable programs is one of its competitive strengths. Many APUS students also transfer a significant number of previously earned academic credit hours, which reduces the length of time required to earn their degrees, and therefore reduces the cost of the degree.
APUS most recently raised tuition for undergraduate and graduate students more than three years ago, in July 2015. Prior to that increase, APUS had not raised undergraduate tuition for 15 years or graduate tuition for four years. Undergraduate tuition at APUS is $270 per credit hour, or $810 per three-credit course. In general, a bachelor’s degree may be earned for $32,670 in tuition costs at current tuition rates. APUS’s graduate tuition is now $350 per credit hour, or $1,050 per three-credit course, which means many APUS graduate degrees may be earned for $12,600 in tuition at current tuition rates. The combined tuition, fees and books at APUS are designed to be less expensive for undergraduate and graduate students than the average in-state cost at a public university. APUS provides a tuition grant to support students who are U.S. Military active duty service 
11

members, National Guard members, reservists, military spouses and dependents, and veterans. For such individuals, tuition is set at the pre-July 2015 rates, with undergraduate course tuition at $250 per credit hour, and graduate course tuition at $325 per credit hour. APUS estimates that the military tuition grant applied to approximately 75% and 77% of its 2017 and 2018 total net course registrations, respectively.
The July 2015 tuition increase was APUS’s first undergraduate tuition increase since 2000, and the first graduate tuition increase in four years. According to ED’s College Affordability and Transparency Center, APUS was listed as the private for-profit, four-year or more undergraduate institution with the 18th lowest tuition for 2016-2017 and 19th lowest net price for 2015-2016, in each case the most recent years for which data is available. 
Undergraduate students enrolled in courses for academic credit receive their textbooks and certain course materials at no additional cost to them through an institutional book-grant program. This book grant represents an approximate savings over the course of a student’s undergraduate degree program of $5,000 as compared to public four-year colleges and universities according to comparative information from The College Board’s Trends in College Pricing 2018 report. APUS also utilizes open access and online library materials where appropriate and works with various publishers to reduce the cost of textbooks and course materials for both undergraduate students receiving the book grant and for graduate students who pay for textbooks and course materials.
In July 2017, APUS began accepting applications for two applied doctoral programs in Strategic Intelligence and Global Security. The first cohorts began in January 2018. The programs meet a need for higher-level education and research combined with professional practice in these fields. The doctoral degrees tuition and residency costs range from $5,005 to $6,675 per term and include a book grant for course materials. APUS doctoral degrees may be earned for between $50,054 and $60,054 in tuition at current tuition rates. 
APUS does not charge an admission fee or fees for services such as registration, course drops or similar events that trigger fees at many other institutions. Because APUS is an exclusively online institution, there are no required resident fees, such as for parking, food service, student union, and recreation. APUS charges students a technology fee, but provides a grant to cover the technology fee for students using DoD tuition assistance programs. When applicable, APUS students are charged certain additional fees, such as graduation, late registration, transcript request, and comprehensive examination fees.
DoD tuition assistance programs cover $250 per credit hour for military students, and these students may also be able to use VA education benefits or aid from ED’s Title IV programs to cover any remaining cost, as described more fully below in “Sources of Student Financing” and “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements.” APUS has set its tuition grant so that the DoD tuition assistance program covers the full tuition cost of undergraduate courses for members of the military up to the annual maximum benefit. 
Sources of Student Financing
APUS’s students finance their education through a combination of individual resources, DoD tuition assistance programs, ED’s Title IV programs, VA education benefits, private loans, state and federal grants, and corporate reimbursement programs. Most students rely on some form of financial aid in addition to their individual resources. Students utilizing DoD’s tuition assistance programs accounted for 37%, those utilizing ED’s Title IV programs 26%, and those using VA education benefits 23% of APUS’s net course registrations in 2018, and we believe that the ability of our students to participate in these programs is essential to APUS’s success. Participation in the DoD tuition assistance programs, ED’s Title IV programs and VA education benefits add to APUS’s regulatory burden, as described more fully below in “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements.” 
Federal legislative activity, including government shutdowns and other budgetary actions, as well as actions by ED and DoD may adversely impact the ability of our students to obtain loans, grants and other forms of tuition financing. Such actions could include eliminating various education and loan programs, reducing the funds or benefits (or both) available under those programs, or enacting new restrictions on participation in those programs. Any such changes, or any other reductions in the funding for such programs, could have a material adverse effect on APUS’s enrollments and our financial condition. The potential risks associated with these and similar events are described more fully below in “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business.”

Faculty and Staff
APUS’s faculty consists of approximately 1,790 full and part-time faculty members with relevant teaching and practitioner experience. The institution also employs professional staff of approximately 850 non-faculty employees to administer APUS’s academic, technology, service and business operations. Most of APUS’s non-faculty employees are based at either its headquarters in Charles Town, West Virginia, or at its administrative offices in Manassas, Virginia. None of APUS’s employees are parties to any collective bargaining arrangement. We believe that APUS has a good relationship with its employees.
APUS has approximately 350 full-time faculty members with the remainder designated as part-time. APUS establishes full-time and part-time positions based on program and course enrollment. Many of APUS’s full-time faculty began their careers with APUS as part-time faculty. We expect that APUS’s faculty headcount and the composition of full-time and part-time faculty will vary with fluctuations in enrollment.
We believe that APUS’s well-regarded faculty, which includes many former and current practitioners in their fields, attracts new students to APUS. A significant majority of APUS’s graduate faculty members hold terminal degrees or doctorates in their relevant fields, and virtually all undergraduate faculty members hold graduate degrees. Exceptions have been granted for a limited number of APUS’s faculty members who do not meet degree standards and who provide evidence of significant experience and achievement in the field of study that they teach, in accordance with APUS’s faculty quality guidelines. Many APUS faculty members have relevant experience at other universities and within military, corporate, and government institutions.
We believe that the quality of APUS’s faculty is critical to the student experience and student outcomes and is therefore vital to APUS’s success. APUS regularly reviews the performance of its faculty by, among other things, monitoring the online contact that faculty has with students, reviewing student feedback, and evaluating the learning outcomes achieved by students. If APUS determines that a faculty member is not performing at an acceptable level, it works with the faculty member to improve performance by assigning the faculty member a mentor, providing additional training and/or coaching the faculty member for success. If the faculty member’s performance does not improve, APUS will no longer employ that faculty member to teach. APUS does not offer tenure to faculty members.
We believe that the composition of APUS’s student body and curriculum are particularly attractive to potential faculty members because of the opportunity to teach relevant material to students who can implement higher education learning at their workplaces. APUS recruits faculty members through referrals by current faculty members, advertisements in higher education and trade association journals and its internet presence. Upon selection for a position, APUS requires each new faculty member to complete an orientation and training program that leads to their certification to teach at APUS and assignment to courses. All faculty members participate in annual faculty-development opportunities and requirements.
Intellectual Property
APUS owns and exercises rights associated with patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, agreements, and registrations to protect its intellectual property. APUS owns all course syllabi and course and instructional materials developed by APUS faculty and employees and, as such, these course materials may be used by APUS in current and future courses as needed to facilitate instruction, and may be modified by APUS to meet evolving course or curriculum requirements. In general, APUS does not assert ownership claims to scholarly works of its faculty, such as articles and books, which were not developed as APUS course materials. Such intellectual property of APUS’s individual faculty members remains the property of each such faculty member and is reserved specifically for use only by the faculty member who owns it, unless the faculty member grants permission for use by others. APUS relies on agreements under which it obtains rights to use course content developed by faculty members and other third-party content providers. APUS owns the copyright for a work by a faculty member if APUS compensated the faculty member for the particular product or if APUS funded the research in whole or in part.
APUS has secured rights to trademarks for various names and terms used in its business, including “American Public University System,” “American Military University,” “American Public University” and logos incorporating the foregoing terms and acronyms of those terms, as well as “Ready When You Are,” “Educating Those Who Serve,” “RESPECTED. AFFORDABLE. ONLINE.,” “COMMITTED TO YOUR FUTURE,” “MASTERS OF DISASTER,” “MOMENTUM,” “MyMomentum” and the term “Partnership At a Distance.” These trademarks and brand names are central to a number of APUS’s marketing efforts and we believe they are important to how prospective students identify APUS. APUS also owns rights to more than 200 internet domain names pertaining to APEI, APUS, AMU, APU and other unique descriptors. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued APUS a patent for PAD in February 2011.

Competition
Within the postsecondary education market, APUS competes primarily with not-for-profit public and private two-year and four-year colleges as well as other for-profit schools, particularly those that offer online learning programs. APUS also competes in specific targeted markets, such as those discussed below. For additional information regarding APUS’s competitive environment, please refer to “Business - Company Overview - Competition.” 
APUS has focused on serving the military community since its founding as AMU, and the military market continues to be the primary market for APUS. Within the military market, there are more than 2,700 institutions that serve military students and receive funds through the DoD tuition assistance program. The primary competitors for military students are other institutions offering online instruction, and colleges and universities offering on-campus instruction located near military installations. Over the last several years, a number of APUS’s competitors have expanded their outreach and marketing efforts directed at active duty and reserve service members, as well as veterans. 
We believe that APUS will continue to see increased competition in the military community from both not-for-profit and for-profit schools. As traditional not-for-profit public and private schools advance their online capabilities, they will be able to more easily support the military community. At the same time, for-profit schools will market to students eligible for DoD tuition assistance programs and VA education benefits, rather than ED’s Title IV programs, in an attempt to comply with an ED regulatory requirement known as the 90/10 Rule that imposes sanctions on participating institutions that derive more than 90% of their total revenue on a cash accounting basis from Title IV programs as calculated under ED’s regulations. This regulatory requirement is described more fully below in “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - The ‘90/10 Rule’.”
Within the market for public service professionals, such as law enforcement personnel or other first responders, and non-military professionals and other working adults with extended and irregular work schedules, APUS faces broad competition with not-for-profit public and private two-year and four-year colleges as well as other for-profit schools, particularly those that offer online learning programs. 
Hondros College of Nursing
HCN’s programs are designed to prepare individuals for productive careers in the field of nursing. HCN’s students principally receive on-campus instruction at one of HCN’s Ohio campuses. In 2018, HCN had five campuses, which are located in the suburban areas of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, and Toledo, and an administrative office located in suburban Columbus. HCN opened the Toledo campus in January 2017. HCN is institutionally accredited by ABHES. 
Curriculum and Scheduling

HCN offers on-campus instruction leading to a Diploma in PN and an ADN. Graduates of the PN Program are eligible to seek licensure as a Licensed Practical Nurse, or LPN, after passing the NCLEX-PN exam. Graduates of the ADN Program are eligible to seek licensure as a Registered Nurse, or RN, after passing the NCLEX-RN exam.
HCN voluntarily discontinued new enrollments in its online RN-to-BSN Program subsequent to the start of the July 2018 term, at which time there were approximately 65 students enrolled in the program. Students currently enrolled in the RN-to-BSN Program may elect to complete the program at HCN or transfer to another institution, including APUS. 
HCN will be enrolling students into its MLT Program at its Cincinnati and Columbus campuses in April 2019. Academic terms for the PN and ADN Programs begin four times each year, with courses starting in January, April, July and October. The academic term for the MLT Program begins two times each year, with courses starting in April and October. Approximately 54% of enrollments for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 were in the PN Program, while 44% were in the ADN Program and less than 2% were in the RN-to-BSN Program.
Student Body and Enrollment
HCN provides nursing education to approximately 2,100 students at five campuses in Ohio. The average HCN student is 30 years old and 93% of HCN students are female. 
Accreditation
14

HCN is institutionally accredited by ABHES, a national accrediting agency that is recognized by ED, and was formerly accredited by the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools, or ACICS. In June 2018, ABHES granted HCN initial institutional accreditation through February 28, 2021. At that time, HCN also was accredited by ACICS. On October 1, 2018, after ED approved HCN’s application to designate ABHES, rather than ACICS, as its institutional accrediting agency, HCN voluntarily withdrew from ACICS accreditation. For additional information related to accreditation, including a discussion of recent correspondence from ABHES related to retention and placement rates at HCN, see “Regulatory Environment - Accreditation.”
HCN’s PN Program received its initial programmatic accreditation through NLN CNEA, with quality improvement conditions, from October 18, 2018 through October 31, 2024. On January 29, 2019, HCN submitted a required progress report to NLN CNEA addressing certain quality indicators.
HCN has also applied for programmatic accreditation by NAACLS for its new MLT Program.
Student Recruitment and Marketing

HCN’s marketing strategy is focused on building long-term relationships with businesses, organizations and individuals in the healthcare community, primarily in Ohio. We believe this strategy will continue to generate a significant number of referrals. In addition, HCN utilizes traditional media as well as internet-focused marketing channels, including organic search, local display advertising and pay-per-click. 
Student Admissions
HCN welcomes prospective students to apply for admission at any time by submitting an application along with an application fee. To be accepted into any HCN program, an applicant must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, be at least 18 years old at the time of starting the program, and hold a high school diploma or General Education Development certificate. HCN’s programs also have program-specific admissions requirements.
Applicants for the PN Program, the ADN Program and the MLT Program are required to complete an interview with an admissions representative, and complete and pass a criminal background check. PN Program and MLT Program applicants are also generally required to take and pass the Health Education Systems Admissions Assessment.
Beginning with the term that started January 2019, HCN implemented enhanced ADN Program admissions requirements, requiring external ADN applicants to have an active unencumbered PN license and to have graduated from an approved PN program. All ADN applicants must take math and reading entrance exams. Applicants that do not meet the minimum placement scores may be required to take additional reading and math prerequisites or denied admission. ADN Program applicants who apply to start in the quarter immediately following their graduation from HCN’s PN Program may be admitted prior to possessing an active unencumbered PN license, but must obtain an active unencumbered PN license prior to the start of their second term. Beginning with the April 2019 term, HCN further changed its admissions standards to remove certain entrance exam requirements.
HCN has also made multiple changes to the assessment process since its original implementation and may further modify it in the future in order to better identify college-ready students. These initiatives require significant time, energy and resources, and if our efforts are not successful, they may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Even if these initiatives successfully lead to the identification and enrollment of students who are likely to succeed and improving student experience, they could result in adverse impacts on HCN enrollments.
Cost of Attendance and Financial Aid
HCN’s tuition costs vary among its programs. HCN’s PN Program may be completed for approximately $19,700 in tuition and fees, the ADN Program may be completed for approximately $28,500 in tuition and fees. Tuition and fees for the RN-to-BSN Program were approximately $20,900. Tuition and fees for the MLT program are expected to be approximately $22,900. Fees include the cost of examination review materials, lab fees, test review fees, and fees for applications with the Ohio Board of Nursing, among others. Some of these costs are payable to HCN and others are payable to third parties. 
HCN’s students also incur costs for textbooks, supplies, uniforms and its technology package. These costs vary among HCN’s programs and are paid for by HCN’s students as the textbooks or supplies are needed. HCN estimates that over the life of its programs a student’s costs related to textbooks and supplies will be approximately $2,100 for the PN Program, $3,600 for the ADN Program, and $4,100 for the MLT Program. 
15

Sources of Student Financing
HCN’s students finance their education through a combination of individual resources, VA education benefits, ED’s Title IV programs, private loans, state and federal grants, corporate reimbursement programs, and beginning July 1, 2018, HCN’s institutional loan program. Most HCN students rely on some form of financial aid in addition to their individual resources. The substantial majority of HCN’s revenue is derived from students utilizing ED’s Title IV programs, which results in increased regulatory risks, as discussed more fully below in “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - The ‘90/10 Rule.’” As a result, HCN’s management may find it necessary to decrease HCN’s enrollment of students utilizing the Title IV programs or pursue other approaches, any of which could have a negative impact on its operating results and our financial condition. 

HCN offers an institutional loan program to students in the form of extended payment plan options. The extended payment plan options are designed to assist students with educational costs consisting of tuition, textbooks, and fees, and are only available after all other student financial assistance has been applied to those costs. Payment plans require monthly payments while the student is enrolled in a program and extend for a period up to six months after the last day of attendance or graduation. Interest does not accrue until the student departs the program or graduates. The institutional loans do not impose any origination fees and generally have a fixed rate of interest. Borrowers are advised about the terms of the loans and counseled to use all federal funding options.

While HCN does not currently participate in DoD’s tuition assistance programs, it may do so in the future, in which case it will be subject to such program’s requirements and restrictions, which are more fully discussed in the “Our Institutions - American Public University System - Sources of Student Financing,” “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements,” “Regulatory Environment - Recent Legislative and Regulatory Activity - Federal Legislative Activity - Sequestration and Budgetary Matters,” and “Risk Factors” sections of this Annual Report.

Faculty and Staff
HCN’s faculty consists of approximately 140 faculty members with relevant teaching and nursing or healthcare practitioner experience. HCN also employs approximately 120 professional staff members who administer HCN’s academic, technology, service, and business operations. HCN’s faculty and staff largely work at one of its five campuses. None of HCN’s employees are parties to any collective bargaining arrangement. We believe that HCN has a good relationship with its employees.
HCN has approximately 100 full-time faculty members with the remainder designated as part-time. All faculty whose instruction is focused within the PN Program must have earned the minimum of a bachelor’s degree in nursing. All faculty whose instruction is focused within the ADN Program and RN-to-BSN Program must have earned the minimum of a master’s degree. All HCN faculty whose instruction is nursing theory-based must have an active license to practice as a Registered Nurse. In addition to the formal education of HCN’s faculty members, many have also obtained specialized certifications in the field of nursing. All faculty whose instruction is focused within the MLT Program must have earned the minimum of a bachelor’s degree in a closely related discipline, must have obtained a specialist certification in the medical technology field, have three years occupational experience and one year teaching experience. 
We believe that selecting well-educated and qualified faculty members is a key component to HCN’s success. In addition to having the necessary educational requirements, HCN seeks faculty members who have demonstrated experience in the field of nursing. Almost all faculty who teach HCN’s nursing courses have nursing experience in a clinical setting, which we believe helps teach HCN’s students the skills needed to be effective and safe caregivers. 
HCN trains and develops new faculty through a formal, structured on-boarding, training, and mentoring program. All new HCN faculty members receive a 90-day on-boarding experience, which includes a formal orientation to the organization, policies and procedures, teaching strategies, performance expectations and role responsibilities.
Intellectual Property
In connection with our acquisition of HCN, we received the right to the corporate name National Education Seminars, Inc. and a royalty-free, irrevocable, exclusive, transferable, sublicensable license to use the name “Hondros College of Nursing” and, instead of “Nursing,” any other qualifier directly related to nursing, medicine or healthcare in connection with the business 
16

and operations of HCN. 
HCN exercises rights associated with copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, agreements, and registrations to protect its intellectual property. 
Competition
HCN’s programs are largely offered as campus-based programs to residents in the geographic areas surrounding its campuses. In these regions, HCN competes with other schools offering similar programs, including for-profit and not-for-profit public and private colleges. Because of its relatively local focus, HCN’s competitive environment is impacted by various factors that are specific not only to Ohio but also to the particular areas of Ohio where HCN’s campuses are located, including the supply and demand dynamics for nurses and for nursing schools, and for MLT Programs. HCN’s results are also therefore more susceptible than the results of an institution that draws from a broader geographical area to the actions of single competitors would be. For example, a particularly effective or ineffective marketing approach by another school, or the opening or closing of another school, could have unanticipated detriments or benefits to HCN’s competitive position. For additional information regarding HCN’s competitive environment, please refer to “Business - Company Overview - Competition.”
Information Technology
Information technology systems are an essential part of our student experience and our business operations. As part of our implementation of the shared services model discussed in “Reporting Segments” above, we began providing information technology services to APUS and HCN through APEI. Previously, APUS had managed its own information technology infrastructure and services and provided information technology services to HCN through an intercompany arrangement. We believe we will need to continue, and potentially increase, our investment of capital, time and resources, in technology operations and enhancements to support our systems and mission.
We have invested significant capital and resources into developing proprietary information systems and processes to support a customized student information and services system that we refer to as Partnership At a Distance™, or PAD. PAD is APUS’s platform for interacting with our students. PAD is an information system designed to enable APUS to provide each student with individualized support at appropriate times from pre-enrollment through and beyond graduation, including student advising, administrative support, and community networking. PAD is used by APUS to manage admissions, online orientation, course registrations, tuition payments, grade reporting, progress toward degrees, and various other functions. 
APUS and HCN use Sakai Collaboration and Learning Environment, or Sakai CLE, an open-source Learning Management System, for their online classroom. There are approximately 350 educational institutions around the world reportedly using Sakai CLE to support teaching, learning, research, and collaboration. PAD and Sakai CLE are our two core enterprise systems. We also have several other systems that are used in the online campus, and to support the student experience, financial aid processing, financial management, human resources processes, marketing, and decision support.
The backbone of our information technology infrastructure consists of two co-location data centers: one in Virginia, and one in Texas. Our technology environment is managed internally. Student access to our systems is provided through redundant data carriers in both data centers.

We believe we will need to continue to make investments in information technology in response to competitive pressures in the marketplace, including increased demands for interactive solutions and access from multiple platforms and to evaluate when it is appropriate to make significant changes, modifications or upgrades, including to update older systems and to enhance functionality. We also continually evaluate our PAD system for possible changes and upgrades. Changes and upgrades to our information technology systems may result in us incurring significant costs in the short term and carry risk to our operations and financial results. Our investments in information technology systems may result in an increased level of spending, not all of which can be capitalized, and may cost more than expected or fail to be successful. Furthermore, as a result of unsuccessful development efforts, or a result of replacing outdated technology, software or other technology related assets, we may have assets that become impaired. For example, for the year-ended December 31, 2016, APUS disposed of approximately $5.1 million in long-lived assets, primarily consisting of a loss that resulted from the abandonment of development of a new student course registration system because it was no longer probable that development would be completed and the software placed in service.
The performance and reliability of our networks and technology infrastructure, including those of third-party systems that we utilize, are critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain students. Any system error or failure could interrupt our ability to operate and could result in the unavailability of our online classrooms, preventing students from accessing their 
17

courses and adversely affecting our results of operations. Our technology infrastructure, and the technology infrastructure of our third-party vendors, could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, cyber-attacks, and hacker activities, terrorist activities, and telecommunications failures. Our computer networks, and the networks of our third-party vendors, may also be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, and other security problems. We have an internal Information Security Program and associated governance and, as part of that program we use external vendors to perform our security assessments on a periodic basis to review and assess our security.

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
In the United States, postsecondary education institutions are regulated by (i) accrediting agencies, (ii) state regulatory bodies, and (iii) the federal government through the U.S. Department of Education, or ED. APUS participates in military tuition assistance programs administered by the U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD, and APUS and HCN participate in veterans’ education benefits programs administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, and our institutions are therefore also subject to oversight by those agencies. Regulations, standards, and policies of these agencies address the vast majority of our operations, including our educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting and financial operations and condition.
The postsecondary education regulatory environment is complex and continues to evolve. Changes in or new interpretations of law, regulations, standards, and policies could have material consequences for our institutions’ accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, receipt of funds under student financial assistance programs, and costs of doing business. The postsecondary education regulatory environment has changed and may change in the future as a result of U.S. federal elections. For example, as described elsewhere in this Annual Report, ED, under new leadership, acted in 2017 to delay the implementation of certain regulations promulgated during the prior administration. In the meantime, ED also has initiated new rulemaking processes to alter existing regulations and could act to change other existing ED policies and practices. The relevant committees in Congress have held hearings and considered various policy and legislative proposals related to HEA reauthorization. We cannot predict the extent to which the Executive Branch and Congress will act to reauthorize the HEA or change or eliminate ED regulations, policies, and practices, nor can we predict the form that new legislation, regulations, policies, or practices may take.
Accreditation
Accreditation is a voluntary, non-governmental process through which an institution or a program submits to review based on the standards of the accrediting agency and the stated aims and purposes of the institution or program. Accrediting agencies establish criteria for accreditation, conduct peer-review evaluations, and publicly recognize those institutions or programs that meet the stated criteria. Accredited institutions and programs are subject to periodic review to ensure institutional and program integrity, to encourage continued high performance and improvement, and to confirm that accreditation criteria continue to be satisfied. An institution or program that does not meet the criteria may have its accreditation limited, revoked, or not renewed.
Accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by ED is necessary to participate in the student financial aid programs authorized under Title IV of the HEA, or Title IV programs, and the DoD tuition assistance programs. To be recognized by ED, accrediting agencies must adopt specific standards and procedures. The National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, or NACIQI, is charged with advising ED on whether to recognize accrediting agencies. In February 2018, NACIQI voted to recommend that ED renew HLC’s recognition for five years. In 2016, NACIQI voted to recommend that ED renew ABHES’s recognition for five years. If one of our institutions’ institutional accreditor were to lose its recognition as an accrediting agency and the institution was unable to obtain recognition from another recognized accrediting agency, the institution could lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and, as applicable, DoD tuition assistance programs.
In October 2018, ED announced that it would establish a negotiated rulemaking committee broadly focused on accreditation and innovation, or the Accreditation and Innovation Committee, to prepare proposed regulations related to, among other things, ED’s recognition of accrediting agencies and related institutional eligibility issues. The Accreditation and Innovation Committee convened for the first of several scheduled meetings in January 2019. We cannot predict what related regulations will be proposed or ultimately adopted.
Additional information about each of our institutions’ accreditation is provided above in each reporting segment’s “Our Institutions - Accreditation” section and as follows:

• | APUS is institutionally accredited by The Higher Learning Commission, or HLC, a regional accrediting agency recognized by ED. HLC accredits degree-granting institutions in a 19-state region, including West Virginia. HLC most recently reaffirmed the accreditation status of APUS in July 2011. The next comprehensive evaluation for reaffirmation of accreditation is scheduled for the 2020-2021 academic year.

In August 2016, HLC adopted a policy that permits HLC to designate publicly an institution as “in financial distress” or “under governmental investigation” where such situations could impact the institution’s operations and HLC believes the public should have this information in making a decision to attend or continue to attend the institution. A 
20

designated institution must undergo special monitoring, and HLC may deny or defer an application from such an institution to make substantive changes in its business. A designation typically will extend for not more than two years and may be removed when HLC determines the institution has resolved the issues that led to the designation. On February 7, 2018, HLC imposed a “governmental investigation” designation on APUS in connection with the Civil Investigative Demand, or CID, issued to APUS on July 31, 2017 by the Attorney General of Massachusetts, which is discussed more fully below in this section in “Consumer Protection.” On August 7, 2018, APUS notified HLC that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and APUS voluntarily entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance, or AOD, to resolve the CID. On August 14, 2018, HLC notified APUS that in light of the AOD, HLC had removed the designation.
In November 2018, HLC approved APUS’s application for a change in structure related to APUS’s proposal to enter into a shared services model with APEI and we entered into an intercompany agreement to implement the shared services model. As required by HLC policy and ED regulation, HLC will conduct a focused site visit that is currently scheduled for late May 2019. 

• | Hondros College of Nursing, or HCN, is institutionally accredited by the Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools, or ABHES, a national accrediting agency recognized by ED. In June 2018, ABHES granted HCN initial institutional accreditation through February 28, 2021. At that time, HCN was accredited by the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools, or ACICS. On September 28, 2018, ED approved HCN’s application to designate ABHES, rather than ACICS, as its institutional accrediting agency for purposes of participation in the Title IV programs. On October 1, 2018, HCN voluntarily withdrew from ACICS accreditation.

ABHES annually reviews student achievement indicators, including retention rate, placement rate, and licensing and credentialing examination pass rate. Under ABHES policy, ABHES may withdraw accreditation at any time if it determines that an institution fails to demonstrate at least a 70% retention rate for each program, a 70% placement rate for each program, or a 70% pass rate on mandatory licensing and credentialing examinations, or fails to meet the state-mandated results for credentialing or licensure. Alternatively, ABHES may in its discretion provide an opportunity for a program to come into compliance within a period of time specified by ABHES, and ABHES may extend the period for achieving compliance if a program demonstrates improvement over time or other good cause. For the reporting year July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018, several HCN programs did not satisfy ABHES’s threshold requirements for retention rates or placement rates. Each such program had a retention or placement rate, as applicable, of between 63% and 69% for the reporting period. As a result, in February 2019, ABHES directed HCN to send ABHES no later than May 7, 2019 evidence that the relevant programs had achieved a retention rate of at least 70% for the period from July 1, 2018 through March 31, 2019 and a placement rate of at least 70% for the reporting year ended June 30, 2018, along with additional documentation and analysis related to those rates and pertinent action plans. If ABHES determines the rates are not at least 70%, and we currently expect that the rates will not meet those standards for the applicable period or for the reporting period ending June 30, 2019, then ABHES in accordance with its review schedule will notify HCN of the timeframe in which the programs must come into compliance. That timeframe typically would not exceed 18 months from the date of notification because HCN’s longest program is at least one year but less than two years in length. ABHES also may require additional action by HCN, such as development of a teach-out plan and additional reporting. If HCN is unable to bring the programs into compliance during the timeframe established by ABHES, ABHES may take other action, up to and including withdrawing accreditation for those programs.
Institutional accreditation is an important attribute of our institutions. Colleges and universities depend in part on accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Students and sponsors of tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for quality assurance, and employers rely on institutions’ accreditation status when evaluating a candidate’s credentials. In addition, the loss of institutional accreditation would result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and, as applicable, DoD tuition assistance programs.
In addition to institutional accreditation, our institutions have obtained specialized accreditation or professional recognition for certain programs, as described more fully above in each reporting segment’s section entitled “Our Institutions - Accreditation.” If one of our institutions fails to satisfy the standards of these specialized accrediting agencies or professional organizations, the relevant programs could lose the specialized accreditation or professional recognition, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs, prevent the institution from offering the programs in certain states where programmatic accreditation is required, or prevent our students from seeking and obtaining licensure or employment.
State Licensure/Authorization
21

Our institutions are subject to regulation by the states in which they operate. The level of oversight varies from state to state, and such regulations change frequently. State laws typically establish standards for instruction, faculty qualifications, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and other operational matters. Some states prescribe regulations related to an institution’s financial condition, and some states require the posting of surety bonds. State laws and regulations may affect our institutions’ ability to offer educational programs, open locations, and award degrees. If one of our institutions fails to comply with a state’s requirements, it may lose its state licensure or authorization, which would result in the institution’s inability to enroll students in that state, and could result in the institution’s inability to receive Title IV program funds and DoD tuition assistance funds, at least for students in that state.
Some states assert authority to regulate an institution if its educational programs are offered to residents of those states, regardless of whether the institution maintains a physical presence in the state. The increased popularity of online education has led and may further lead to new laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. New laws, regulations, or interpretations could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states, which could negatively affect enrollments and revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes in our business activities could lead states that do not currently require our institutions to be authorized to require such authorization. The extent of this increase in regulatory obligations, and the associated costs and significance, are not known at this time. Furthermore, in some states it may take a significant amount of time to meet the applicable regulatory requirements with respect to a new program initiative, or we may not be able to do so at all.
The State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement, or SARA, is a voluntary agreement among member states, districts and territories that establishes national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance education and is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by institutions based in another jurisdiction. SARA requires member jurisdictions to approve institutions in their jurisdiction to participate in SARA, based upon institutional accreditation and financial stability, and to resolve student complaints. Applications must be renewed annually. SARA does not cover, or limits its coverage related to, certain activities. As a result, an institution may still be required to obtain state authorization from, for example, agencies or boards responsible for professional licensure. We cannot predict the extent to which states will retain membership in SARA, the manner in which SARA’s rules may be modified, interpreted and enforced, our institutions’ ability to comply with SARA’s requirements and retain eligibility, or the impact that failure to meet the SARA requirements may have on our business.
Many states also have specific requirements that an individual must satisfy in order to be licensed as a professional in a specified field. Students’ success in obtaining licensure typically depends on several factors, including: individual merits of the graduate; whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure or by a professional association; whether the program meets all state requirements for professional licensure; and the accreditation of the institution and the specific program. 
Federal Requirements for State Licensure/Authorization
“Home” State Authorization
ED regulations effective July 1, 2015 specify how an institution may demonstrate, as required by ED, that it is authorized to offer postsecondary educational programs by the state(s) where it is located, which we refer to as its “home” state. In addition, the home state must have a process to review and take appropriate action on complaints concerning postsecondary institutions. If ED determines that an institution does not have the required state approval or that the state does not have the appropriate complaint process, the institution will be ineligible to participate in Title IV programs. If one of our institutions were to lose its ability to participate in Title IV programs in connection with “home” state authorization requirements, it would also lose its ability to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs. The loss of ability of one of our institutions to participate in either Title IV programs or DoD tuition assistance programs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
State Authorization of Online Education
In December 2016, ED published final regulations addressing, among other issues, state authorization of programs offered through distance education, which were scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2018. On June 29, 2018, ED announced that it would delay the effective date of the distance education portion of the state authorization final regulations until July 1, 2020. The final regulations require an institution offering distance education programs to be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state, in order to award Title IV aid to such students. An institution may obtain such authorization directly from the state or through a state authorization reciprocity agreement that satisfies ED’s definition of such an agreement. The final regulations also require an institution to document the state process for 
22

resolving complaints from students enrolled in programs offered through distance education and to provide certain disclosures to enrolled and prospective students regarding programs that are provided or can be completed solely through distance education. 
The Accreditation and Innovation Committee is considering proposed regulations related to, among other things, disclosure and other requirements of state authorization. We cannot predict what related regulations will be proposed or ultimately adopted.
State Authorization/Licensure of Our Institutions
APUS is authorized to enroll students from each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. APUS is headquartered in Charles Town, West Virginia, with administrative offices in Virginia. APUS is authorized to offer its programs by the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission, or WVHEPC. Under current law, if APUS were to lose its accreditation by HLC, WVHEPC may suspend, withdraw, or revoke APUS’s authorization. Failure to comply with WVHEPC requirements could result in APUS losing its authorization from WVHEPC, its accreditation by HLC, its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs, or its ability to offer certain programs, any of which could force APUS to cease operations. Under Virginia law, because it has administrative offices in Virginia, APUS is required to be authorized by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, or SCHEV. Accordingly, APUS has obtained SCHEV’s authorization to operate as an out-of-state institution. APUS has participated in SARA since its application was approved in December 2014. APUS also has obtained authorization to operate in California, which is the only state that is a non-SARA jurisdiction. 
HCN is physically headquartered in Westerville, Ohio, and has five campuses in Ohio. HCN is authorized to offer its programs by the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools. HCN’s Practical Nursing Diploma and Associate Degree in Nursing programs are approved by the Ohio Board of Nursing, or OBN. HCN’s Associate Degree in Medical Laboratory Technology as well as its online completion program leading to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (which is no longer enrolling new students) are approved by the Ohio Department of Higher Education. HCN has participated in SARA since its application was approved in April 2016.
To apply for licensure to practice nursing in Ohio, an applicant must have successfully completed a nursing education program approved by the OBN. The OBN requires that nursing education programs have a pass rate on the relevant National Council Licensure Examination, or NCLEX, that is at least 95% of the national average for first-time candidates in a calendar year. If a program does not attain this pass rate, the program may face various consequences. In March 2017, the OBN placed HCN’s ADN Program on provisional approval because the ADN Program had not met the pass rate standard for four consecutive years. The OBN will consider restoring a program to Full Approval status if the program meets the pass rate standard for at least two consecutive years. If a program on provisional approval fails to meet OBN requirements at the end of the time period established for provisional approval, the OBN may propose to continue provisional approval for a set time period or may propose to withdraw approval. In March 2018, the OBN found that HCN’s ADN Program did not meet the OBN pass rate standard in 2017 for a fifth consecutive year, and we believe that the OBN will reach the same conclusion for 2018. HCN has been implementing changes, including curriculum, admissions, and academic achievement and course retake policy changes, that are designed to improve NCLEX scores over time, but there is no assurance that these changes will be successful or will not have negative effects on HCN’s enrollment. For example, enrollments in HCN’s ADN Program for the term beginning in January 2019 were significantly lower than HCN expected, which we believe is likely associated with the implementation of new admissions requirements that had the effect of reducing enrollments from qualified students. This situation could have an adverse impact on our ability to enroll students and eventually our ability to continue HCN’s ADN program, any of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. 
Failure to comply with state authorization or licensure requirements could restrict our institutions’ ability to recruit or enroll students or result in other sanctions, including fines and penalties. We review state requirements to determine whether our institutions’ activities in those states may constitute a physical presence or otherwise may require authorization or licensure. New laws, regulations, interpretations, or changed circumstances related to our institutions’ educational programs could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students and offer programs in particular states, which could, in turn, adversely affect our institutions’ enrollments and revenue and have a material effect on our business.
Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements
Our students finance their education through a combination of Title IV programs, DoD tuition assistance programs, education benefits administered by the VA, private loans, corporate reimbursement programs, individual resources and, in the case of HCN, an institutional loan program. Participation in federal student aid programs, including those administered by DoD and VA, and the institutional loan program at HCN, adds to the regulation of our operations. In particular, the HEA and related 
23

ED regulations subject us to significant scrutiny in the form of numerous standards we must satisfy in order to participate in and administer Title IV programs.
Department of Education
The federal government provides support for postsecondary education through the Title IV programs in the form of grants and loans to eligible students who can use those funds to enroll in an eligible educational program at any institution that has been certified by ED. An institution will be certified to participate in the Title IV programs only if, among other things, it enters into a written program participation agreement, or PPA, with ED, which conditions participation in Title IV programs upon compliance with ED regulations and any additional conditions specified in the PPA.
Types of Title IV Financial Aid Programs.
Title IV program aid is primarily awarded to students on the basis of financial need, generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending an institution and the amount a student can reasonably contribute. Our students receive grants and loans to fund their education under several Title IV programs, of which the two largest are Direct Loans and Pell Grants:
(1) Federal Student and Parent Loans. Direct Loan Program loans, including Federal Stafford Loans, Federal Parent PLUS Loans, Federal Grad PLUS Loans and Federal Consolidation Loans, are made directly by the federal government to students or their parents. A student with financial need may receive a subsidized Stafford Loan where ED pays the interest on the loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time and during the first six months after leaving school. Students with or without demonstrated financial need may receive an unsubsidized Stafford Loan where the student is responsible for accrued interest. Federal Parent PLUS Loans are unsubsidized loans made to parents of dependent undergraduate students. Federal Grad PLUS Loans are unsubsidized loans available to graduate or professional students enrolled at least half-time. Federal Consolidation Loans allow a student to combine multiple federal education loans into one loan with one interest rate.
(2) Federal Grant Programs. Pell Grants are awarded to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. The maximum Pell Grant was $6,095 for the 2018-2019 award year and will be $6,195 for the 2019-2020 award year. A student’s lifetime eligibility to receive a Pell Grant is 12 semesters (or its equivalent). Students may not be able to use all of this eligibility at our institutions based on their prior receipt of Pell Grants at other institutions. Beginning July 1, 2017, institutions may award Pell Grant funds for up to 150% of a student’s standard scheduled Pell Grant in one award year. This provision, which commonly is referred to as “year-round Pell,” is intended to allow students to graduate more quickly and with less debt. Some of our students may also be eligible for other Title IV grant programs, such as the Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant or Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant. 
(3) Federal Work-Study. Under the Federal Work-Study program, ED pays a share of the cost of part-time employment of eligible students to perform work for the institutions they attend or for off-campus public or not-for-profit organizations.
Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs
To be eligible and certified to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by ED, must be authorized to operate by the appropriate regulatory authority in each state where the institution maintains a physical presence, and must comply with specific standards and procedures set forth in the HEA and the regulations issued thereunder by ED. 
ED periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations. Accrediting agencies and state education agencies also have responsibilities for overseeing institutional compliance with certain Title IV program requirements. For these reasons, we cannot predict with certainty how Title IV program requirements will be applied in all circumstances. Key provisions relating to institutional participation in Title IV and the processing of Title IV aid that could adversely affect us include the following:
Eligibility and Certification Procedures. An institution must apply periodically to ED for continued certification to participate in Title IV programs. Recertification generally is required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change of control. An institution may come under review when it expands its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location, adding a new program, or, in certain cases, when it modifies academic credentials that it offers.
ED may place an institution on provisional certification status if ED finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all Title IV requirements and in certain other circumstances, such as when an institution undergoes a change in ownership resulting 
24

in a change of control. During a period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions imposed by ED. In addition, ED may more closely review a provisionally-certified institution if it applies for approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another school, or make any other significant change. If ED determines that a provisionally-certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities, it may seek to revoke the institution’s certification to participate in Title IV programs with fewer due process protections than if it were fully-certified. 
APUS is certified to participate in Title IV programs through September 30, 2020 and will be required to apply timely for recertification in order to continue to participate in the Title IV programs after that date. HCN was provisionally-certified to participate in the Title IV programs from November 2013 until September 2018. Since September 28, 2018 when its application for recertification was approved, HCN has been certified to participate in Title IV programs, without the restrictions of provisional certification. HCN will be required to apply timely for recertification in order to continue to participate in the Title IV programs after September 30, 2021.
State Authorization. To participate in Title IV programs, a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies. As described more fully above in “State Licensure/Authorization,” ED has specified the types of state approvals that are acceptable to demonstrate that an institution is authorized to offer postsecondary educational programs, and ED has promulgated rules, the implementation of which has been delayed until July 1, 2020, that address authorization by states in which students enrolled in distance education programs reside.
Administrative Capability. ED regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite “administrative capability” to participate in Title IV programs, including that the institution must:

• | comply with all applicable Title IV program regulations;


• | have capable and sufficient personnel to administer Title IV programs;


• | have acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students;


• | not have cohort default rates above specified levels;


• | have various procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds;


• | not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension;


• | provide financial aid counseling to its students;


• | refer to ED’s Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any applicant, student, employee or agent of the institution has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs;


• | submit in a timely manner all required reports and financial statements;


• | develop and apply an adequate system to identify and resolve discrepant information with respect to a student’s application for Title IV aid; and


• | not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability.

If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria, ED may require the repayment of Title IV program funds, transfer the institution from the “advance” system of payment to cash monitoring status or to the “reimbursement” system of payment, place the institution on provisional certification status, or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend, or terminate the institution’s participation in Title IV programs.
Financial Responsibility. The HEA and ED regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions must satisfy in order to participate in Title IV programs. These standards generally require that an institution provide the services described in its official publications and statements, properly administer Title IV programs in which it participates, and meet all of its financial obligations, including making required refunds and any repayments to ED.
ED evaluates institutions on an annual basis for compliance with specified financial responsibility standards, including a complex formula based on line items from the institution’s audited financial statements. The formula focuses on three financial ratios: (1) equity ratio (which measures the institution’s capital resources, financial viability, and ability to borrow); (2) primary reserve ratio (which measures the institution’s viability and liquidity); and (3) net income ratio (which measures the institution’s profitability or ability to operate within its means). Generally, an institution’s financial ratios must yield a composite score of at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible. Under certain circumstances, an institution may be able to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis by complying with various conditions.
ED may also apply the financial responsibility standards to other entities under common ownership with an eligible institution. At the request of ED, for purposes of evaluating the financial responsibility of our institutions, including the composite score calculation, we supply consolidated financial statements to ED.
25

The Borrower Defense Regulations, which are described in more detail below and went into effect as of October 16, 2018, modify ED’s financial responsibility standards to provide that a non-public institution may not be financially responsible if it is subject to one or more triggering events. As discussed below under “Federal Rulemakings,” ED is in the process of developing new regulations relevant to its financial responsibility requirements. We are unable to predict the manner and effect of full implementation of the Borrower Defense Regulations, including because of their broad scope and because ED has said it will issue guidance about how it plans to implement the Borrower Defense Regulations while the current rulemaking remains in progress.
Failure of one of our institutions to meet the “financial responsibility” requirements, because it does not satisfy the minimum composite score or is unable to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis, or because it fails to meet other financial responsibility requirements, could cause the institution to lose access to Title IV program funding, or result in other penalties or conditions on continued participation. ED’s determination that our consolidated financial statements do not satisfy the “financial responsibility” requirements could cause both APUS and HCN to lose access to Title IV program funding, or result in other penalties or conditions on continued participation.
The “90/10 Rule.” Under the so-called “90/10 Rule”, a proprietary institution is prohibited from deriving more than 90% of its revenue (as computed by ED) on a cash accounting basis (except for certain institutional loans) from Title IV programs for any fiscal year. If an institution violates the 90/10 Rule for any fiscal year, the institution is placed on provisional status for two fiscal years. An institution that violates the rule for two consecutive fiscal years becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years and is required to demonstrate compliance with Title IV eligibility and certification requirements for at least two additional fiscal years prior to resuming Title IV program participation. 
Using the applicable 90/10 formula, the following table contains the percentage of cash-basis revenue earned from Title IV program funds:

 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018
APUS | 43% | 41% | 41% 
HCN | 84% | 83% | 82% 

In recent years, Congress has considered various proposals that would modify the 90/10 Rule. One previous proposal would have decreased the limit on Title IV funds from 90% to 85% and would have counted DoD tuition assistance and GI Bill education benefits toward that limit. In contrast, another proposal would have eliminated the 90/10 Rule. At this time we cannot predict whether or how the recent change in Congressional control will affect proposals to modify the 90/10 Rule. Such proposals, or other similar legislation, should they become law, could have a material adverse impact on the operations of our institutions
Incentive Payment Rule. An institution participating in Title IV programs may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment, admissions, or financial aid awarding activity based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or federal student financial aid. In June 2015, ED announced that it will calculate institutional liability for noncompliance with the incentive payment rule by calculating the cost to ED of the Title IV funds improperly received by the institution, including the cost to ED of all of the Title IV funds received by the institution over a particular period of time if those funds were obtained through implementation of a policy or practice in which students were recruited in violation of the incentive payment rule. ED may also fine an institution, or take administrative action to limit, suspend, revoke, deny, or terminate an institution’s eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, if the institution violates the prohibition. 
We believe that our employee compensation and third-party contractual arrangements comply with the incentive payment rule currently in effect. However, because there are ambiguities as to how the rule is interpreted and enforced by ED, we can make no assurances that ED would not find deficiencies in our past, current, or future employee compensation plans and relevant third-party contractual arrangements. In addition, in recent years, other postsecondary educational institutions have been named as defendants to whistleblower lawsuits, known as “qui tam” cases, brought pursuant to the Federal False Claims Act, alleging that an institution’s compensation practices did not comply with the incentive payment rule. Any such litigation could be costly and could divert management’s time and attention away from the business, regardless of whether a claim has merit.

Gainful Employment. Under the HEA, proprietary schools are eligible to participate in Title IV programs in connection with educational programs that lead to “gainful employment in a recognized occupation,” except for certain programs leading to a bachelor’s degree in liberal arts. Historically, this concept has not been defined in detail.
On October 31, 2014, ED published final regulations relating to gainful employment, which we refer to as the GE Regulations. The GE Regulations went into effect on July 1, 2015, with the exception of certain disclosure requirements, which generally went into effect January 1, 2017. Under the GE Regulations, ED annually provides a template to be used in connection with those disclosure requirements, and institutions must provide updated disclosures by a set date. On January 19, 2018, ED released the most recent version of the disclosure template, which institutions were required to adopt on or before April 6, 2018. Some portions of the disclosure requirements, including requirements to include a link to the disclosure template in promotional materials and to distribute directly a copy of the disclosure template to prospective students, have been delayed until July 1, 2019. 
The GE Regulations establish debt-related measures for determining whether certain postsecondary education programs prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. Under the two debt-to-earnings measures, which we refer to collectively as the D/E rates, a program will “pass” if its graduates have annual loan payments less than or equal to 8% of their total earnings (the annual earnings rate) or less than or equal to 20% of their discretionary income (the discretionary income rate). A program that does not pass either of the D/E rates, and that has an annual earnings rate greater than 8% and less than or equal to 12% or a discretionary income rate greater than 20% and less than or equal to 30%, will be in a warning “zone.” A program “fails” if its annual earnings rate is greater than 12% and its discretionary income rate is greater than 30%. A program will become ineligible for Title IV funding if it fails both D/E rates twice in three consecutive years, or if the program is in the warning “zone” for four consecutive years. An institution must provide warnings to students, including prospective students, when notified by ED that a program could become ineligible based on its D/E rates for the next award year.
According to ED’s final 2015 D/E rates, which were released in January 2017, none of the APUS gainful employment programs were failing or in the warning “zone.” ED’s D/E rates include no calculations of regular or transitional D/E rates for approximately three quarters (76 out of 100) of APUS’s gainful employment programs because ED does not calculate regular D/E rates for programs with fewer than 30 students in the cohort. According to ED’s final 2015 D/E rates, none of the HCN gainful employment programs were failing or in the warning “zone.” We are unable to reliably and accurately predict how our programs may perform under the accountability measures in the future, including because certain underlying data required to calculate the D/E rates are not available to us. There is no assurance that the rates in the future will remain the same and how our gainful employment programs will perform under ED’s accountability measures. ED has not released 2016 or subsequent debt-to-earnings measures, and ED has announced that because it no longer has a data-sharing agreement with the U.S. Social Security Administration to receive earnings data, ED is currently unable to calculate the debt-to-earnings measures under the GE Regulations.
The GE Regulations also include certification requirements. For example, the GE Regulations require an institution to certify that each eligible gainful employment program offered by the institution satisfies certain requirements related to institutional and programmatic accreditation and professional licensure or certification exam requirements. A failure to comply with the GE Regulations could result in our institutions losing eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could, in turn, adversely affect our institutions’ enrollments and revenue and have a material effect on our business.
On August 14, 2018, ED published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking to rescind in their entirety the GE Regulations and announced a plan to update the College Scorecard or a similar web-based tool to provide program-level outcomes for all higher education programs at all institutions that participate in the Title IV Programs. We cannot predict what regulations ultimately will be adopted. 
Student Loan Defaults. Under the HEA, an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if defaults on the repayment of federal loans by its students exceed 40% in any one year or 30% for each of three consecutive years. An institution’s cohort default rate is calculated as the percentage of borrowers who entered repayment in the relevant fiscal year who default before the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the borrowers entered repayment. If an institution’s cohort default rate is equal to or greater than 30%, it must establish a default prevention task force.
In September 2018, ED released official three-year cohort default rates for federal fiscal year 2015. The final official ED cohort default rates for APUS and HCN for the federal fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 are as follows:
27


 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 
APUS | 20.1% | 23.6% | 23.8%
HCN | 11.4% | 11.4% | 11.4%

If one or both of our institutions has a default rate in excess of allowable levels, it could result in that institution’s or those institutions’ loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or incurring additional costs related to default prevention, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Privacy of Student Personal Information and Records. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, or FERPA, and ED’s regulations implementing FERPA require educational institutions to protect the privacy of students’ educational records by, among other things, limiting disclosure of a student’s personally identifiable information without prior written consent. If an institution fails to comply with FERPA, ED may require corrective actions by the institution or may terminate an institution’s eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. In addition, educational institutions engaged in financial activities such as the granting of student loans are obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, and applicable GLBA regulations, which among other things, require a comprehensive, written information security program to protect personally identifiable financial information of students, parents, or other individuals in a customer relationship with the institution. Failure to comply with the applicable GLBA requirements may result in Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, enforcement, which could include the imposition of conditions, penalties, monitoring and oversight. Institutions are also subject to the general deceptive and unfair practices jurisdiction of the FTC with respect to their collection, use, protection and disclosure of student information. Institutions must also comply with the FTC Red Flags Rule, a requirement designed to identify and mitigate identity theft for certain student accounts. States also have applicable privacy and security laws and a new law in California, the California Consumer Privacy Act taking effect in January 2020, imposes new disclosure obligations and contains a broad array of consumer rights relating to their personal information with the potential for significant penalties for failing to comply. Our collection of personal information relating to students or other individuals who are in the European Union, or EU, may implicate the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which took effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR contains numerous requirements relating to the collection, possession, use and disclosure of personal information. The GDPR requirements are generally stricter and more comprehensive than those of the U.S. Enforcement priorities and interpretation of certain GDPR provisions remain unclear. However, non-compliance with the GDPR could result in a fine for certain activities of up to 20 million Euros or 4% of an organization’s global annual revenue, whichever is higher, per violation. 
Accessibility for Students with Disabilities. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or Section 504, prohibits discrimination against a person with a disability by any organization that receives federal financial assistance, which includes us. In 2010, ED’s Office for Civil Rights, which enforces Section 504, together with the Department of Justice, asserted that requiring the use of technology in a classroom environment when such technology is inaccessible to individuals with disabilities violates Section 504, unless those individuals are provided accommodations or modifications that permit them to receive all the educational benefits provided by the technology in an equally effective and integrated manner. In recent years, ED’s Office for Civil Rights has taken enforcement action against several institutions of higher education, including primarily online institutions, after determining that their websites and online learning management platforms were not accessible to persons with a disability. If one of our institutions is found to have violated Section 504, it may be required to modify existing content and functionality of its online classroom or other uses of technology, including through adoption of specific technical standards. An institution that does not come into compliance with Section 504 could lose access to federal funding, including the ability to participate in the Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs. 
College Affordability and Transparency Lists. ED publishes on its website lists of the top 5% of institutions, in each of nine categories, with (i) the highest tuition and fees for the most recent academic year, (ii) the highest “net price” for the most recent academic year, (iii) the largest percentage increase in tuition and fees for the most recent three academic years, and (iv) the largest percentage increase in net price for the most recent three academic years. An institution placed on a list for high percentage increases in either tuition and fees or in net price must submit a report to ED explaining the increases and the steps that it intends to take to reduce costs. ED reports annually to Congress on these institutions and publishes its reports on its website. ED also posts lists of the top 10% of institutions in each of the nine categories with lowest tuition and fees or the lowest net price for the most recent academic year. APUS was listed as the private for-profit, four-year or more undergraduate institution with the 18th lowest tuition for 2016-2017, the most recent year for which data is available, and 19th lowest net price for 2015-2016, in each case the most recent years for which data is available. We cannot predict with certainty the effect such lists will have on our operations.
28

College Scorecard. In September 2015, ED publicly released its “College Scorecard” website, which among other characteristics, allows users to search for schools based upon programs offered, location, size, tax status, mission, and religious affiliation. However, we do not believe the College Scorecard’s method for calculating graduation rates appropriately indicates APUS’s graduation rate because the College Scorecard’s graduation rate includes only the performance of first time, full-time undergraduate students, who represent less than approximately 1% of all APUS students. Furthermore, substantially all other College Scorecard measures are based on data collected only about students who receive Title IV program aid. While a significant portion of APUS students receive Title IV program aid, they are a minority of APUS’s students. Beginning in October 2017, ED announced that its Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, from which data for the College Scorecard is drawn, would begin to provide additional information about institutions’ performance, including completion data for part-time and non-first-time students. We cannot determine the extent to which the data collected and published by ED has impacted or may impact our institution’s enrollments, reputation, or operating results. On August 14, 2018, ED announced a plan to update the College Scorecard or a similar web-based tool to provide program-level outcomes for all higher education programs at all institutions that participate in the Title IV Programs.
Third-Party Servicers. ED regulations permit an institution to enter into a contract with a third-party servicer for the administration of any aspect of the Title IV programs. Our institutions utilize third-party servicers for some services and in the future may consider using third-party servicers for other functions that are currently managed directly by our institutions. Third-party servicers must, among other obligations, comply with Title IV requirements and be jointly and severally liable with the institution to ED for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV provision. An institution must report to ED new contracts with or any significant modifications to contracts with third-party servicers and other matters related to third-party servicers. If any third-party servicer engaged by one of our institutions does not comply with applicable statute and regulations, our institution may be liable for its actions, and our institution could lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.
Title IV Return of Funds. When a student withdraws, an institution must return unearned Title IV program funds to ED in a timely manner. An institution must first determine the amount of funds that a student “earned” before withdrawal. If the student withdraws during the first 60% of any period of enrollment or payment period, the amount of Title IV program funds that the student earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds for which the student would otherwise be eligible. If the student withdraws after the 60% threshold, then the student has earned 100% of the Title IV program funds. The institution must return to the appropriate Title IV programs, in a specified order, the lesser of (i) the unearned Title IV program funds or (ii) the institutional charges incurred by the student for the period multiplied by the percentage of unearned Title IV program funds. An institution must return the funds no later than 45 days after the date of the institution’s determination that a student withdrew.
If 5% or more of such returns were not timely made, the institution may be required to submit a letter of credit in favor of ED equal to 25% of the amount of unearned Title IV funds the institution was required to return for its most recently completed fiscal year. HCN’s Title IV compliance audit for the year ended December 31, 2012 identified a deficiency related to timely return of Title IV program funds. In a Final Audit Determination Letter dated February 28, 2014, ED determined that HCN was not required to repay the liability to ED and directed HCN to adopt procedures to prevent reoccurrence. HCN was also required to post an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $128,290, which was released by ED in February 2018. APUS’s Title IV compliance audit for the year ended December 31, 2016 identified a finding related to return of Title IV funds calculations that were not properly computed. In a Final Audit Determination letter dated January 29, 2018, ED conveyed its finding that funds had not been returned timely. ED also noted that a similar finding had been made in an open program review with respect to which APUS has not yet received a program review report. In connection with the finding, ED required that APUS post an irrevocable letter of credit for approximately $700,000, which the Company posted on March 28, 2018. If ED determines that one of our institutions has repeatedly failed to comply with ED regulations, it may take adverse action against the institution on the basis of the repeated finding or may find that the institution has failed to demonstrate administrative capability, as described above.
Misrepresentation. Under the HEA and its implementing regulations, ED may fine, suspend or terminate the participation in Title IV programs by an institution that engages in substantial misrepresentation regarding the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. 
In December 2015, ED determined to fine HCN $27,500 based on a finding that HCN had substantially misrepresented its programmatic accreditation status prior to our ownership of HCN. HCN noted its disagreement with ED’s findings but paid the fine in order to promptly resolve the matter. 
The Clery Act. Our institutions are required to comply with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, or the Clery Act. The Clery Act requires an institution, among other things, to report to ED and disclose in an annual security report, for the three most recent calendar years, statistics concerning the number of certain 
29

crimes that occurred on or within the institution’s so-called “Clery geography” and to publish certain policies and procedures related to campus safety. A failure to comply with the Clery Act could result in our institutions being fined or having their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs limited, suspended, or terminated, could lead to litigation, or could harm our institutions’ reputation, each of which could, in turn, adversely affect our institutions’ enrollments and revenue and have a material effect on our business.
Borrower Defenses. Under the HEA, ED is authorized to specify in regulations which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a Direct Loan. ED’s previous regulations permitted a borrower to assert a borrower defense to repayment of a Direct Loan if the institution’s acts or omissions give rise to a cause of action against the institution under state law. For Direct Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2017, the Borrower Defense Regulations create a new federal standard for borrower defenses to repayment of Direct Loans, new limitation periods for such claims, and new processes for resolution of such claims. Several times between June 2017 and February 2018 and for various reasons, ED announced delays until July 1, 2019 of the implementation of certain portions of the Borrower Defense Regulations, including those portions of the regulations that would have established a new federal standard and a process for determining whether a Direct Loan borrower has a defense to repayment on a Direct Loan based on an act or omission of an institution. However, in October 2018, a judge denied a request to delay implementation of portions of the Borrower Defense Regulations, and as a result the Borrower Defense Regulations went into effect as of October 16, 2018. The Borrower Defense Regulations will remain in effect until such time as any new regulations develop under the current rulemaking process with respect to borrower defense to repayment, described below, are effective. We are unable to predict the manner and effect of full implementation of the Borrower Defense Regulations, including because of their broad scope and because ED has said it will issue guidance about how it plans to implement the Borrower Defense Regulations while further rulemaking remains in progress. We cannot predict what regulations will be proposed or ultimately adopted.
On July 31, 2018, ED published a notice of proposed rulemaking that, among other things, would establish a new federal standard for evaluating, and a process for adjudicating, borrower defenses to repayment of loans made under the Direct Loan Program on or after July 1, 2019. For more detail about that rulemaking process and the notice of proposed rulemaking, see “Recent Legislative and Regulatory Activity - Regulatory Activity - Federal Rulemakings.” We cannot predict what final regulations will be adopted as a result of this rulemaking process. 
Under either the Borrower Defense Regulations or any new regulations, if ED determines that borrowers of Direct Loans who attended our institutions have a defense to repayment of their Direct Loans, our repayment liability to ED could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
Department of Defense
Service members of the United States Armed Forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of service through the Uniform Tuition Assistance Program of the DoD, or DoD tuition assistance programs. Service members may use this tuition assistance to pursue postsecondary degrees at institutions that are accredited by accrediting agencies recognized by ED. APUS participates in DoD tuition assistance programs, and for students in APUS undergraduate programs, we have established tuition rates per credit hour that under current DoD policies can be 100% covered by DoD tuition assistance funds provided that the student does not exceed the annual limits per student. HCN has submitted an application to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs. 
In March 2013, DoD issued an instruction restricting the ability of service members in certain duty locations outside the continental United States, or overseas locations, to receive DoD tuition assistance for courses offered by institutions of higher education that are not parties to contracts with the DoD to provide DoD voluntary education programs at those locations. Because we do not have contracts with the DoD to provide instruction at overseas locations, service members who begin a postsecondary education program after arrival in an applicable overseas duty location may not use DoD tuition assistance programs to pay for their education in our programs until after they have already successfully completed a course with an institution that has entered into a contract to provide voluntary education programs at that overseas location. Service members who were already enrolled in one of our programs before arriving at an overseas duty location may continue to receive DoD tuition assistance for the in-progress program, but they will be encouraged to enroll in courses provided by institutions that provide programs at the applicable overseas duty location.
In recent years, DoD has issued briefings that prohibit base commanders from authorizing education institutions to hold regular or recurring office hours on installations solely to provide counseling and prohibit former military members from accessing installations to represent an educational institution using their government ID card privileges. This has adversely affected our efforts to support existing students and recruit new students. If we are not able to improve our access to military 
30

installations and our existing students on those installations, or find alternative methods to serve those students, our military enrollments could continue to decline. 
Each institution participating in DoD tuition assistance programs is required to sign a Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU, outlining certain commitments and agreements between the institution and DoD prior to being permitted to participate in the DoD tuition assistance programs. In May 2014, DoD promulgated new regulations and a revised MOU, the 2014 MOU, which APUS signed in August 2014. Pursuant to the 2014 MOU, among other requirements, institutions must: explain certain tools to service members, such as ED’s “College Navigator” website and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s “Paying for College” website; comply with requirements related to readmission policies for service members; abide by limitations on the use of funds derived from tuition assistance; provide certain academic and student support services; disclose information about transfer of credit; in certain circumstances, return tuition assistance funds to DoD (such as when a student ceases to attend or an institution cancels a course); offer to service members loan counseling before private student loans are offered or recommended; and comply with ED’s Title IV “program integrity” rules, including rules related to incentive payments and misrepresentation. The 2014 MOU also provides that an institution may only participate in DoD tuition assistance programs if it is accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED, approved for VA funding, and a participant in Title IV programs. Additional information regarding the potential risks associated with the 2014 MOU is provided in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report.
In January, 2014, several federal government agencies announced an online student complaint system for service members, veterans, and their families to report negative experiences at education institutions and training programs administering the Post-9/11 GI Bill, DoD tuition assistance programs, and other military-related education benefit programs. An institution having recurring substantive complaints, or demonstrating an unwillingness to resolve complaints, may face a range of penalties, including revocation of its MOU and removal from participation in the DoD tuition assistance programs.
Department of Veterans Affairs
The VA administers education benefits provided by federal law, including the Montgomery GI Bill, or GI Bill, and the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, or Post-9/11 GI Bill. APUS is approved to provide education to veterans and members of the selective reserve and their dependents by the state approving agencies in West Virginia and Virginia. Programs at each of HCN’s campuses are approved for VA benefits by the state approving agency in Ohio.
Under current law, for the academic year from August 1, 2018 - July 31, 2019, an eligible veteran who attends a non-public U.S. institution may receive veterans’ education benefits to pay for tuition and fees based on the net cost to the veteran up to $23,671.94. Veterans pursuing a program of education on a more than half-time basis at an on-campus location are eligible for a monthly housing allowance equal to the basic allowance for housing available to service members who are at a military pay grade E-5 and have dependents. Veterans pursuing a program of education solely through distance education on a more than half-time basis are eligible to receive a monthly housing allowance equal to 50% of the basic allowance for housing available to service members who are at a military pay grade E-5 and have dependents, or $825.00 per month.
In fall 2018, VA acknowledged that many students eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits were experiencing longer than typical wait times to receive payments for tuition and fees and monthly housing payments due to technology-related issues during peak enrollment season. VA announced that it would prioritize payments to students in hardship situations, including where a beneficiary was in danger of losing housing, having utilities turned off, or receiving collection notices from creditors.
To the extent that DoD tuition assistance programs do not cover the full cost of tuition for service members, eligible service members may also use their benefits under the GI Bill or the Post-9/11 GI Bill through the “Top-Up” program. The “Top-Up” program allows U.S. Military active duty service members to use their GI Bill or Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to pay the difference between the total cost of a college course and the amount of DoD tuition assistance that is paid by the military for the course, but is limited to 36 months of payments.
Additional Sources of Student Payments
In addition to the Title IV, DoD, and VA programs described above, eligible students may participate in other financial aid programs or receive support from other governmental and private sources. Some of our students finance their own education or receive full or partial employer tuition reimbursement. Our institutions enter into agreements with various employers through which our institutions agree to a variety of terms, including terms related to the provision of tuition grants to eligible employees. Our institutions may offer interest free payment plans of less than 12 months to students to assist them with the financing of educational expenses. In certain circumstances, our students may access alternative loan programs from a number 
31

of private lenders, which are intended to cover the difference between what the student receives from all financial aid sources and the student’s total cost of attendance. As part of an institution’s Title IV PPA, the institution must adopt a code of conduct pertaining to student loans, including alternative loans.
Beginning July 1, 2018, HCN began offering an institutional loan program to students in the form of extended payment plan options. The extended payment plan options are designed to assist students with educational costs consisting of tuition, textbooks, and fees, and are only available after all other student financial assistance has been applied. Payment plans require monthly payments while the student is enrolled in a program and extend for up to six months after the last day of attendance or graduation. Interest does not accrue until the student departs the program or graduates. The institutional loans do not impose any origination fees and generally have a fixed rate of interest. Borrowers are advised about the terms of the loans and counseled to use all federal funding options. This program is subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, including the Truth in Lending Act as implemented in Regulation Z, the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act and the Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices provisions of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act.
Consumer Protection
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, has pursued enforcement actions against certain for-profit institutions of higher education and has released several reports that directly address issues related to institutions of higher education. In October 2017, the CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman released a report analyzing more than 7,700 complaints from private student loan borrowers and more than 12,900 federal student loan servicing complaints the CFPB received between September 1, 2016 and August 31, 2017. We do not know what enforcement actions the CFPB may pursue, or what steps Congress or federal agencies may take, in response to these reports and whether such actions, if any, will have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
Other Issues Related to Consumer Protection and Complaints
Many states have become more active in regulating proprietary education from a consumer protection perspective, specifically related to enforcement of consumer protection laws and implementation of new regulations by state attorneys general. For example, on August 3, 2017, we received from the Attorney General of Massachusetts a CID, dated July 31, 2017, relating to an investigation of alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices by AMU in connection with the recruitment and retention of students and the financing of education. The CID required the production of documents and information relating to recruitment, enrollment, job placement and other matters. On August 6, 2018, APUS entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance, or AOD, to resolve the inquiry. Pursuant to the terms of the AOD, and without any finding or admission of wrongdoing on APUS’s part, APUS paid $270,000 to the Attorney General and agreed to otherwise comply with applicable Massachusetts regulations. Other state attorneys general may also initiate inquiries into us or our subsidiaries. Actions by state attorneys general and other governmental agencies, whether or not involving us or our institutions, could damage our reputation and the reputation of our institutions and limit the ability to recruit and enroll students, which could reduce student demand for our institutions’ programs and adversely impact our revenue and cash flow from operations.
Our institutions are recipients of complaints filed with state regulatory authorities, the Better Business Bureau, and posted in online forums. Our institutions attempt to resolve such complaints in a cooperative manner. However, even if such complaints are resolved or are otherwise unfounded they may still harm the reputation of our institutions. For example, in August 2017, HCN received notice from the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools that the Ohio State Board was responding to student complaints and initiating formal disciplinary action against HCN’s Cincinnati campus because the campus discontinued offering one version of the PN Program curriculum and implemented a new PN Program curriculum allegedly without the Ohio State Board’s permission. It was alleged that at least three students enrolled in the discontinued curriculum were unable to complete without transferring into the new program and incurring substantial costs and time to complete the program. As permitted, on August 10, 2017, HCN requested a hearing before the Ohio State Board with respect to the notification. Simultaneously, HCN submitted a proposed resolution to the Ohio State Board, which included for each of the three students a partial refund for classes in which they enrolled but earned no credit. The Ohio State Board accepted HCN’s proposal. One student accepted the partial refund, and the two others failed to return executed agreements to the Ohio State Board by their due dates. As a result, HCN is no longer obligated to make partial refunds to those two students, and on January 8, 2018, the Ohio State Board informed those two students that it had closed their cases.
Compliance with Regulatory Standards and the Effect of Regulatory Violations
Compliance Reviews
32

Our institutions are subject to compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including ED, its Office of Inspector General, state licensing agencies, agencies that guarantee FFEL Program loans, DoD, VA, and accrediting agencies. The HEA and ED regulations also require institutions to submit annually a compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and applicable ED Office of Inspector General audit standards. For fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2016, our institutions must submit such audits that have been conducted in accordance with the guide for audits of proprietary schools that was issued by the ED OIG in September 2016. In addition, to enable ED to make a determination of financial responsibility, institutions must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with ED regulations.
In September 2016, ED began a program review of APUS’s administration of the Title IV programs during the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 award years. As part of the program review, ED conducted a site visit from September 12 to September 15, 2016. In general, after ED conducts its site visit and reviews data supplied by the institution, if ED identifies any instances of noncompliance, ED sends the institution a preliminary program review report to which the institution has an opportunity to respond. ED then issues a final program review determination letter identifying any findings, including any liabilities. The institution may appeal any monetary liabilities specified in the final letter. APUS has not received a preliminary program review report or expedited final program determination letter, and the program review remains open and ongoing. We anticipate that certain findings addressed in the 2016 Title IV compliance audit Final Audit Determination letter dated January 29, 2018 will be resolved through the program review process, including a finding that return of Title IV funds calculations were incorrectly computed for some students and a finding that APUS had incorrectly reported the students’ enrollment status to the National Student Loan Data System for some students. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of the program review, when it will be completed, or whether ED will place any liability or other limitations on APUS as a result of the review.
In order to participate in the DoD tuition assistance programs, institutions must agree to participate in DoD’s Voluntary Education Institutional Compliance Program, or ICP. An institution that through the ICP is found noncompliant with DoD requirements and demonstrates an unwillingness to resolve a finding may be subject to a range of penalties from a written warning to termination of the institution’s participation in the DoD tuition assistance programs. Upon request, on May 29, 2017, APUS submitted a self-assessment in connection with the ICP. On February 9, 2018, DoD issued a report for APUS that made two findings. With respect to recruiting, marketing, and advertising, DoD found that attire worn by an individual providing testimonials on the institution’s public-facing website could be construed as similar to a distinctive part of military uniform. With respect to financial matters, DoD found that APUS provided a lack of information relating to the financial aid process, including the lack of a timeline for applying for financial aid. APUS submitted the required corrective action plan to DoD on March 15, 2018, and submitted evidence of corrective actions taken related to both findings in advance of the deadline for submission. On June 15, 2018, DoD notified APUS that DoD had reviewed the corrective action plan and determined the proposed actions appear to sufficiently address the findings in the Iteration 1 Report. On December 19, 2018, DoD notified APUS that all corrective actions had been reviewed and accepted by DoD and no further action is required. 
Potential Effect of Regulatory Violations
If our institutions fail to comply with the regulatory standards governing Title IV programs, ED could impose one or more sanctions, including transferring our institutions to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment, seeking to require repayment of certain Title IV program funds, requiring the posting of an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of ED as a condition for continued Title IV certification, taking emergency action against our institutions, referring the matter for criminal prosecution, or initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, condition, suspend, or terminate participation in Title IV programs. If such sanctions or proceedings were imposed against our institutions and resulted in a substantial curtailment, or termination, of participation in Title IV programs, our institution’s enrollments, revenue, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. If APUS’s approval to participate in Title IV programs is terminated, APUS will also lose its ability to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs pursuant to the DoD MOU, which would materially and adversely affect our enrollments, revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.
If one of our institutions were to lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or if the amount of available Title IV program funds were reduced, we could seek to arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or financial aid for students. Although we believe that one or more private organizations would be willing to provide financial assistance to students attending our institutions, there is no assurance that this would be the case, and the interest rate and other terms of such financial aid might not be as favorable as those for Title IV program funds. We may be required to guarantee all or part of such alternative assistance or might incur other additional costs in connection with securing alternative sources of financial aid. Accordingly, the loss of our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or a reduction in the amount of available federal student financial aid, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations even if we could arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or student financial aid.
33

In addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our institutions’ participation in Title IV programs, we also may be subject, from time to time, to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies, but also by other government agencies and third parties, such as present or former students or employees and other members of the public.
Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations
Many actions that we may wish to take in connection with our operations are subject to regulation from a variety of agencies. For example, ED’s regulations, state regulatory requirements and accrediting agency standards may, in certain instances, limit our ability to acquire or sell institutions, and to establish additional locations and programs. Many states require approval before institutions can add new programs, campuses, or teaching locations. WVHEPC, SCHEV, HLC, ABHES, the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools, and the Ohio Department of Higher Education generally require institutions to notify them, and sometimes require institutions to obtain their approval, in advance of opening a new location or implementing new programs.
Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control
ED’s regulations, state regulatory requirements and accreditation standards may limit our ability to acquire, merge, or sell institutions, and may impose restrictions on activities following a transaction. For example, ED must approve any change in ownership resulting in a change of control. These restrictions may impede our ability to grow by acquisition, or to dispose of assets. Moreover, as a publicly-traded company, the potential adverse regulatory effects of a change of control could influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance, or redemption of our stock. In addition, the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control could discourage bids for our shares of common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares.
U.S. Department of Education
An institution that undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and must apply to ED in order to reestablish such eligibility. ED’s regulations provide that a change of control of a publicly-traded company occurs in one of two ways: (i) there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing a change of control; or (ii) the corporation has a stockholder that owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation, and that stockholder ceases to own at least 25% of such stock, or ceases to be the largest stockholder. As a result, a significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock, including an acquisition resulting in a stockholder owning at least 25% of our outstanding stock, could be determined by ED to be a change in ownership and control.
Upon a change in ownership and control, an institution is ineligible to receive Title IV program funds during the period prior to recertification. The HEA provides that ED may temporarily provisionally certify an institution seeking approval of a change in ownership and control based on preliminary review of a materially complete application received within 10 business days after the transaction. ED may continue such temporary provisional certification on a month-to-month basis until it has rendered a final decision on the institution’s application. If ED determines to approve the application, it issues a provisional certification, which extends for a period expiring not later than the end of the third complete award year following the date of provisional certification. 
When a change in ownership and control occurs, ED applies certain financial tests to determine the financial responsibility of the institution in conjunction with its review. The institution generally is required to submit a same-day audited balance sheet reflecting the financial condition of the institution immediately following the change in ownership, and the same-day balance sheet must satisfy certain requirements. In addition, when a change in ownership and control occurs and there is a new owner, the institution must submit to ED audited financial statements of the institution’s new owner’s two most recently completed fiscal years. ED may determine whether the financial statements meet financial responsibility standards with respect to the composite score formula. If the institution does not satisfy these requirements, ED may condition its approval of the change of ownership on the institution’s agreement to letters of credit, provisional certification, and additional monitoring requirements. The composite score formula and related ED conditions are described more fully above in “Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Financial Responsibility.” If the new owner does not have the required audited financial statements, ED may impose certain restrictions on the institution, including with respect to adding locations and programs.
State Regulatory Agencies
34

Many states require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in ownership or other aspects of institutional status. The types of and triggers for such reporting or approval vary, but many states include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change of control requiring approval. A change of control may require us to obtain approval of the change in ownership and control in order to maintain our state approval. 
Accreditors
Many accrediting agencies require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval for certain changes in ownership or other aspects of institutional status, but the types of and triggers for such reporting or approval vary.
HLC, the accrediting agency for APUS, requires HLC accredited institutions to inform HLC in advance of any substantive change. Examples of substantive changes requiring advance notice to HLC include changes in the legal status, ownership, or form of control of the institution, such as the sale of a for-profit institution. HLC must approve a substantive change in advance in order to include the change in the institution’s accreditation status. HLC also requires an on-site evaluation within six months to confirm the appropriateness of the approval.
HLC oversight extends to defined changes that occur in an institution’s parent or controlling entity, and not necessarily in the institution itself. Actions by, or relating to, an accredited institution, including a significant acquisition of another institution, significant changes in board composition or organizational documents, and accumulations by one stockholder of greater than 25% of the capital stock could trigger additional reviews of the institution and possible change from accredited status to candidate status, which enhances the risks associated with these types of actions. In particular, a change from accredited status to candidate status could adversely impact an institution’s ability to participate in Title IV programs, which in turn would impact the institution’s ability to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs.
ABHES, the accrediting agency for HCN, requires its accredited institutions to notify ABHES of any substantive change. Examples of substantive changes requiring notice to and approval by ABHES include changes in the legal status, form of control, or ownership of the institution. An institution must notify ABHES of a change of ownership within 10 days after the close of the transaction, and ABHES must act to reinstate the institution’s accreditation status after the change of ownership. ABHES also requires an on-site evaluation within six months to confirm the appropriateness of the approval.
Should we attempt to enter into transactions with institutions accredited by other accreditors, we would be required to follow the requirements of such accreditors. Our management may not have experience with the accreditors of the target institution, which would increase the risks related to such a transaction and management of the institution subsequent to the transaction.
Other Agencies
In certain circumstances, state approving agencies responsible for oversight of veterans education benefits may require an institution to obtain approval for a change in ownership and control. The state approving agency in Ohio approved the November 1, 2013 change of ownership of HCN. However, there is no guarantee that relevant state approving agencies will approve future transactions.
Restrictions on Adding Locations and Educational Programs
ED may, as a condition of certification to participate in Title IV programs, require prior approval of new locations, programs or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add. ED’s regulations also require institutions to report and, in certain cases (such as when an institution is provisionally-certified), to seek approval for a new additional campus location at which at least 50% of an eligible program will be offered if the institution wants to disburse Title IV program funds to students enrolled at that location. Institutions are responsible for knowing whether they need approval, and institutions that add locations and disburse Title IV program funds without having obtained any necessary approval may be subject to administrative repayments and other sanctions.
The HEA requires proprietary institutions to be in full operation for two years before qualifying to participate in Title IV programs. However, ED regulations in many circumstances permit an institution that is already qualified to participate in Title IV programs to establish additional campus locations that are exempt from the two-year rule. The new campus location must satisfy all other applicable requirements for institutional eligibility, including approval by the relevant state authorizing agency and the institution’s accrediting agency. 
35

A fully-certified degree-granting institution generally is not obligated to obtain ED’s approval of an additional program leading to a degree at the same level previously approved by ED, or of a new program that both prepares students for gainful employment in the same or related recognized occupation as an educational program that has previously been designated as an eligible program at that institution and meets certain minimum-length requirements. However, ED could require prior approval of such programs or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add. In the event that an institution is required to obtain ED’s approval for the addition of a new program, fails to do so, and erroneously determines that the new educational program is eligible for Title IV program funds, the institution could be liable for repayment of those Title IV program funds.
Recent Legislative and Regulatory Activity
Federal Legislative Activity
As a result of budgetary pressures, Congress has enacted several pieces of legislation that impact the funding of Title IV and other tuition assistance programs. Due to the substantial amount of federal funds disbursed to schools through Title IV programs, the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs, and significant political interest in the cost of education, Congress continues to show interest in regulation and oversight of institutions of higher education, especially those that are for-profit.
Sequestration and Budgetary Matters
On August 2, 2011, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011 which put into place a series of automatic federal budget cuts, known as sequestration, which impacted certain federal student aid programs beginning in fiscal year 2013. While sequestration does not otherwise change the amount or terms or conditions of Direct Loan Program loans, including Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans, it raised the loan fee paid by borrowers for Direct Loan Program loans disbursed after March 1, 2013. The Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019, increased the maximum Pell award to $6,195 for the 2019-2020 award year. The Pell Grant program could be subject to cuts or changes in the future. Cuts to ED’s administrative budget could lead to delays in student eligibility determinations and delays in origination and processing of federal student loans.
After sequestration took effect, the Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, and Marine Corps announced the suspension of their tuition assistance programs. Congress subsequently approved legislation requiring DoD to restore its tuition assistance programs, and each branch of the military restored its tuition assistance program. The DoD tuition assistance programs were again temporarily suspended during the October 2013 U.S. government partial shutdown. As a result of continued uncertainty about the availability of funding, several of the military branches announced changes to their tuition assistances programs that took effect in federal fiscal year 2014. For example, the Army now requires service members to complete one year of service after graduation from Advanced Individual Training in order to be eligible for tuition assistance and reduced the total benefit per service member per year from $4,500 to $4,000, the Coast Guard reduced the total per service member annual benefits, and subsequently suspended its tuition assistance program during the partial government shutdown that began on December 22, 2018. In addition, the Marine Corps required Marines to have 24 months on active duty prior to being eligible to apply for tuition assistance. In June 2018, the Secretary of the Army issued Army Directive 2018-09, changing the Army tuition assistance eligibility policy. For additional information and other changes see “Department of Defense” below. Additional changes to the tuition assistance programs could occur, including due to Congressional action or DoD policy and funding changes.
Funding for the federal government, including the DoD, lapsed on each of January 20, 2018 and February 9, 2018, resulting in partial shutdowns that lasted for a few days and several hours, respectively. Funding for some portions of the federal government, not including the DoD, lapsed on December 22, 2018, resulting in a partial government shutdown that lasted for 35 days. A future government shutdown, particularly one that includes DoD or suspension of DoD tuition assistance programs, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.
Higher Education Act
The HEA must be periodically reauthorized by Congress and each Title IV program must be funded through appropriations acts on an annual basis. The most recent comprehensive reauthorization occurred in 2008 when Congress reauthorized most HEA programs through the 2014 federal fiscal year. In 2018, the House of Representatives considered proposals from Republicans and Democrats, referred to as the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform Act, or PROSPER Act, and the Aim Higher Act, respectively, but neither proposal became law. The new Congress currently is in the process of considering comprehensive legislation to reauthorize the HEA. We cannot predict whether, in what form, or when, the two houses of Congress will reauthorize the HEA or whether, or when, the President will 
36

sign reauthorization legislation. Amendments to the HEA could occur as part of reauthorization, which could require us to modify our business practices and increase administrative costs, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations. 
Regulatory Activity
Executive Order
Executive Order 13777, “Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda,” signed by the President on February 24, 2017, directs federal agencies including ED to establish a Regulatory Reform Task Force to evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations to the agency head regarding the regulations. The first Progress Report from the ED Regulatory Reform Task Force identified a list of over 150 ED regulations and 1,772 issues of policy-related guidance that would be reviewed by the Task Force. In October 2017, the ED Regulatory Reform Task Force announced in a second Progress Report that ED’s Office for Postsecondary Education had identified 398 guidance documents that were out-of-date and that it intended to withdraw.
Federal Rulemakings
On August 14, 2018, ED published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking to rescind in their entirety the GE Regulations and announced a plan to update the College Scorecard or a similar web-based tool to provide program-level outcomes for all higher education programs at all institutions that participate in the Title IV Programs. We cannot predict what final regulations will be adopted as a result of this rulemaking process.
On July 31, 2018, ED published a notice of proposed rulemaking that, among other things, would establish a new federal standard for evaluating, and a process for adjudicating, borrower defenses to repayment of loans made under the Direct Loan Program on or after July 1, 2019. Under the proposed standard, an individual borrower could assert a defense to repayment based on the institution’s statement, act, or omission that is false, misleading, or deceptive. To be eligible for relief, the borrower would be required to demonstrate that the misrepresentation (1) was made with knowledge of its false, misleading, or deceptive nature or with a reckless disregard for the truth, (2) was relied upon by the borrower in making an enrollment decision, and (3) caused the student financial harm. ED would have discretion to determine the appropriate amount of relief. In addition, the proposed regulations would modify ED’s requirements with respect to the circumstances under which a borrower is eligible for a loan discharge if its institution or location closes. The proposed regulations also would require institutions that require students to enter into pre-dispute arbitration agreements or class action waivers as a condition of enrollment to disclose those requirements in an easily accessible format. In addition, the proposed regulations would amend ED’s financial responsibility provisions in several respects. The proposed rules would identify certain conditions or events that have or may have an adverse material effect on the institution’s financial condition, in response to which ED would or could require that the institution submit some form of financial protection. We cannot predict what final regulations will be adopted as a result of this rulemaking process. The Borrower Defense Regulations, which became effective October 16, 2018, will remain in effect until such time as any new regulations develop under the current rulemaking process are effective.
On October 15, 2018, ED announced its intent to establish the Accreditation and Innovation Committee, including three subcommittees, to prepare proposed regulations on several topics related to the Title IV programs. ED intends for the committee and its subcommittees to develop proposed regulations to revise ED’s regulations related to accreditation and innovation to among other things, ED’s recognition of accrediting agencies, state authorization of distance education, the definition of “regular and substantive interaction” as that term is used in ED’s definition of “distance education”, the definition of “credit hour”, written arrangements between an institution and another entity to provide a portion of an education program, barriers to innovation and competition contained in ED’s regulations, and direct assessment and competency-based education. ED held several public hearings to solicit input during September 2018. The Accreditation and Innovation Committee convened for the first of several scheduled meetings in January 2019. We cannot predict what regulations will be proposed or ultimately adopted. 
On November 29, 2018, ED published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding related to implementation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs that receive funding from the federal government. The proposed regulations would define what constitutes sexual harassment for purposes of Title IX in the administrative enforcement context, would describe what actions trigger an institution’s obligation to respond to incidents of alleged sexual harassment, and would specify how an institution must respond to allegations of sexual harassment. ED will accept public comment on the proposed rules until January 28, 2019. We cannot predict what final regulations will be adopted as a result of this rulemaking process.
Department of Defense
37

On June 6, 2018, the Secretary of the Army issued Army Directive 2018-09, changing the Army tuition assistance eligibility policy by eliminating the one-year waiting period to pursue an undergraduate certificate or degree and the ten-year waiting period to pursue a graduate degree through use of tuition assistance. Under the new policy, effective beginning August 5, 2018, Army soldiers are eligible for two tiers of tuition assistance depending on their current level of civilian education.
On July 12, 2018, DoD announced a change to the Post-9/11 GI Bill regarding the ability of service members to transfer their educational benefits to eligible family members. Beginning July 12, 2019, the eligibility to transfer the educational benefits will be limited to service members with at least six but fewer than 16 years of total service.
The States
As discussed above in “Consumer Protection - Other Issues Related to Consumer Protection and Complaints,” many states have become more active in regulating proprietary education from a consumer protection perspective, specifically in regards to enforcement of consumer protection laws and implementation of new regulations by state attorneys general. Since our institutions operate in many jurisdictions, our institutions may be subject to regulations promulgated by a variety of regulators.
