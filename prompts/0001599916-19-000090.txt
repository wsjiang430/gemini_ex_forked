Item 1. Business. 
Corporate History
 
The Company was originally incorporated with the name Superb Acquisition, Inc., under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 30, 2017, with an objective to acquire, or merge with, an operating business.
 
On June 18, 2017, Thomas DeNunzio of 780 Reservoir Avenue, #123, Cranston, RI 02910, the previous sole shareholder of Superb Acquisition, Inc. entered into and consummated a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Takehiro Abe., with an address at 2-41-7-336, Shinsakae, Naka-ku Nagoya-shi, Aichi, 460-0007, Japan. Pursuant to the Agreement, Mr. DeNunzio transferred to Takehiro Abe 20,000,000 shares of our common stock, which represented all of our issued and outstanding shares in consideration of $34,900.
 
In regards to the above transaction, the shares were sold pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Regulation S") since the sale of common stock was made to a non-U.S. person (as defined under Rule 902 section (k)(2)(i) of Regulation S), pursuant to offshore transactions, and no directed selling efforts were made in the United States by the issuer, a distributor, any of their respective affiliates, or any person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing.
 
Following the closing of the share purchase transaction, Takehiro Abe gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and became the controlling shareholder of the Company.
 
On June 18, 2017, Mr. Thomas DeNunzio resigned as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer, such resignation of which is to be effective ten days after the filing and mailing of an Information Statement required by Rule 14f-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The resignation was not the result of any disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.
 
On June 18, 2017, Mr. Takehiro Abe was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer, to hold such office ten days after the filing and mailing of an Information Statement required by Rule 14f-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
On June 20, 2017, the Company filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, a Certificate of Amendment to change the name of Registrant to AIS Holdings Group, Inc.
 
On October 25, 2017, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Takehiro Abe. Pursuant to this Agreement, on October 25, 2017 Takehiro Abe transferred to AIS Holdings Group, Inc., 100 shares of the common stock of AIS Japan Co., Ltd.., a Japan corporation (“AIS Japan”), which represents all of its issued and outstanding shares, in consideration of 1,000,000 JPY.
 
Following the effective date of the share purchase transaction above on October 25, 2017, AIS Holdings Group, Inc. gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of AIS Japan’s common stock and AIS Japan became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company is now the controlling and sole shareholder of AIS Japan.
 
On February 28, 2018, AIS Japan purchased the basic package software for cryptocurrency trading platform (“Software Platform Package”) from Herol Gaibin in amount of 2,000,000 JPY ($18,000). AIS Japan intends to provide IT development services pertaining to the Software Platform Package to companies focused on the digital currency industry throughout Japan. Additional information regarding this can be found below under, “Overview.”
 
On April 1, 2018 the Company entered into an agreement with Trend Rich Global Limited to lease the Company’s Software System package. The Software System Package is source code that can be expanded upon to create custom websites for clients in the digital currency industry.
 
On August 16, 2018, AIS Japan Co., Ltd., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a Software Development Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Herol Gaibin, whereas Herol Gaibin will improve upon the Company’s existing Software Platform Package which is owned by AIS Japan. The fee to further develop the software is in amount of 5,000,000 JPY (approximately $45,000).
 
Overview
 
We are a start-up stage company with a fiscal year end of March 31. Effective February 28, 2018, our wholly owned subsidiary, which we operate exclusively through at this time, AIS Japan, purchased a "Software Platform Package," from Herol Gaibin in the amount of 2,000,000 JPY ($18,822).
 
The "Software Platform Package" is source code, intended to be used as a baseline which can be expanded upon to create third party websites for companies in the cryptocurrency industry. The Company currently, and intends to continue to, lease out the source code code, known as the "Software Platform Package", to third parties. Additionally, we offer supplementary IT services to alter the source code in order to add additional features, at the request of clients, for additional fees which may vary depending on the scope of the changes. 
 
Source code is the set of instructions and statements written by a programmer using a computer programming language. This code is later translated into machine language by a compiler. The translated code is referred to as object code.
 References to our “source code” throughout are synonymous with our “Software Platform Package”, “Software System Package” and “Cryptocurrency Trading Platform”. They are all one in the same.

Primary Business Activity
 
Our principal business activity revolves around the development and licensing of our Software Platform Package. Given that it is possible to customize the Software Platform Package to the specifications set by our potential customers, we will detail herein the base model (without customization) that exemplifies the standard website one can create through the use of our Software Platform Package. On their created website clients will be greeted with a variety of features and functions that are relevant to the current digital currency market. While we have several features implemented at present, it is important to note that our software is still in ongoing development and certain features may change and/or be removed entirely if necessary.
 
Our pricing policies have not been fully determined at this time, as we are currently evaluating pricing on a case by case basis. At present, our Software Platform Package allows for users of our clients’ websites to create their own log in information and customizable profile that displays their full name and username. On their profile they are able to view user agreements such as the terms and conditions of use and for added security they will be able to opt into two factor authentication. The security feature utilizes the Google authenticator for android and iOS, and users are able to opt in and out of this additional security verification.
 
Note: “Coins” refer to digital tokens, also referred to herein as “cryptocurrency”. These items have no physical tangible value. A cryptocurrency wallet is a software program that stores private and public keys and interacts with various blockchain to enable users to send and receive digital currency and monitor their balance. If you want to use Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, you will need to have a digital wallet. A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions.  ICO is synonymous with Initial Coin Offering.
 
For each client website created with our Software Platform Package there are three main components: A cryptocurrency wallet, a cryptocurrency exchange, and an ICO tab to view current ICOs. The cryptocurrency wallet will enable users to deposit and withdraw digital coins, as well as view their current cryptocurrency balance at any time. Additionally, users will be able to send coins to others, view current news, announcements and ongoing ICOs.
 
In the cryptocurrency exchange tab of websites created with our Software Platform Package, users are, and will be, able to view live updated exchange rates for various cryptocurrencies, place both buy and sell orders for various cryptocurrencies (at present this is limited to ETH and BTC, but we have intentions to add additional cryptocurrencies over time) and view their open orders. Users have the ability to view their order list where they can see the amount of cryptocurrencies exchanged, whether it was bought or sold, and at what value. In this same section of the website users are able to make deposits into their account, look at a live trade view complete with transaction history, as well as their trade history.
 
On the ICO tab of websites created with the Software Platform Package users are able to view a list of ongoing ICOs. However, in no way will the Company be acting as a conduit, or a broker to sell any digital coins of any party.
 
As our software further develops we may increase the number of features available to users, remove certain features, or alter their functionality in material ways. As such, all of the aforementioned features of the Software Platform Package should be viewed in light of the fact that development is ongoing.
 
Rules and Regulations - Japan
 
The following are rules and regulations in Japan regarding cryptocurrency, that we believe may, in some capacity, impact our business. It should be noted that we believe our current and planned business operations and services do not conflict with the rules or regulations in Japan, and the Company does not need any governmental approval to conduct its business activities, due to the fact that the Company’s business is limited to IT development and IT consulting services. Our clients will need to comply with any and all government regulations pertaining to businesses in the cryptocurrency industry. In accordance with the Payment Services Act, amended on May 17, 2018, specifically Article 63-2 “No person may engage in the Virtual Currency Exchange Service unless the person is registered with the Prime Minister.” Additionally, Articles 63-3 and 63-4 in the Payment Services Act detail the procedures that must be followed to apply for registration with the prime minister and to register as a virtual currency provider. In accordance with the Amended Payment Services Act, the cryptocurrency exchange service is defined as follows:
 
(i) purchase and sale of a cryptocurrency or exchange with another cryptocurrency;
 (ii) intermediary, brokerage or agency services for the act set forth in the preceding item; and
 (iii) management of users' money or cryptocurrency, carried out by persons in connection with their acts set forth in the preceding two items.
 While these regulations do not specifically pertain to our business, as we do not operate a cryptocurrency exchange, we believe that such regulations will be relevant for our current and future clients. Should regulations evolve and become more burdensome or costly, it is possible that the cryptocurrency industry overall will suffer, and as such our own business, which caters to this industry, will also be negatively impacted in as of yet unforeseen ways.
 
In October 2018, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (“FSA”) granted the cryptocurrency industry self-regulatory status, permitting the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (“JVCEA”) to police and sanction exchanges for any violations. The FSA approval gives the JVCEA rights to set rules to safeguard customer assets, prevent money laundering, and provide operational guidelines. The JVCEA will also be responsible for policing compliance with all imposed regulations. The JVCEA describes its duties as inspecting the security of crypto exchanges in Japan, as well other specific tasks like assessing tokens issued in an ICO. The Company believes that there is no direct impact on our business by this self-regulatory status because the Company does not intend to operate any exchange and issue any token. However, if the guidelines and regulations imposed by the JVCEA prove to be too burdensome for many potential market entrants to comply with, then the number of our potential clients will most likely decrease accordingly.

Consultation Services
 
At present, our Chief Executive Officer, Takehiro Abe, intends to offer consulting services to clients who are seeking to better understand, or improve the effectiveness of, their ICOs. Mr. Abe has experience assisting with the creation of ICOs, such as for the cryptocurrency called the FTV Token created on Ethereum, and intends to advise clients based on his own first-hand experiences in the industry. As part of his role as an IT consultant to the Company that conducted the ICO for the FTV Token, Mr. Abe was responsible for the creation of the ERC20 (a technical standard used for smart contracts to implement tokens on Ethereum), providing support for the creation of the coin’s white paper, and assisting with the development of an the ICO. At present, the ICO of FTV Token has concluded. Additionally, Mr. Abe also has supported the creation of a smart contract on Ethereum for KeyToken, a cryptocurrency.  
 
Mr. Abe was also subcontracted to advise the creators of MIKS Coin and APC Token about the ICO process. Mr. Abe has no ongoing relationship with either MIKS Coin and APC Token, and subsequent to answering any and all of the creators’ questions, he no longer provides any services to them and does not have any knowledge of the current status of their ICOs. 
 
Mr. Abe primarily assisted both the Key Token and FTV Token during preparation for their ICOs by defining user requirements, providing oversight of engineering, and progress management. Mr. Abe hopes that through his industry experience he will be able to assist companies seeking to conduct their own ICO. At the present time, no pricing policies have been set regarding his consulting services, nor has he determined the extent to which he intends to consult clients. However, we believe that this service will vary on a case by case basis per the specific needs of each client. To reiterate again, however, the Company and Mr. Abe will not be acting as a conduit, or a broker to sell any digital coins of any party and the Company will not be operating any kind of cryptocurrency exchange, nor is Mr. Abe conducting any ICOs..
 
Software (Website) Creation
 
As mentioned previously, we have a "Software Platform Package" which is source code intended to be used as a baseline, which can be expanded upon, to create third party websites for companies in the cryptocurrency industry. To create these websites, for third parties using our Software Platform package, and to add additional elements not included in our existing software platform package, we intend to hire third party contractors to perform these IT services. We will vet out such contractors on a case by case basis.
Cyber Security 
 
Our "Software Platform Package" is source code intended to be used as a baseline, which can be expanded upon, to create third party websites for companies in the cryptocurrency industry.
 
Third party websites created with our source code are not hosted on any servers owned by our Company. We do not host any website content, nor do we own any website servers. Clients will, and currently do, utilize their own discretion as to what service provider(s) will host their websites. As a result, any security measures are, in our opinion, the responsibility of our clients. We currently require existing clients, and will continue to require future clients, to sign a release of liability regarding any security breaches of client websites utilizing our source code. Our source code does have built in features to minimize the possibility of hacking, but we do not make any assurances or guarantees that such measures will be sufficient for our clients’ websites. These security features include, but are not limited to, providing users the ability to login with two factor authentication to reduce the chance of a breach of a user’s account password or info. The security feature utilizes the Google authenticator for android and iOS, and users are able to opt in and out of this additional security verification. Clients may add additional security measures to their own websites as seen fit and at their own discretion. 
 
Regarding delivery of our Software Platform Package, we provide the source code to clients via a media disk whereas the source code can be copied onto the client computer. We believe this is more secure than email or comparable methods.
 
Custody
 
Our source code is not protected by any trademarks, patents, or provisions. However, we have clients who lease our source code sign a waiver stating they will not sell, share, or redistribute the source code “Software Platform Package” we provide them to create their own third party websites.
 
Our clients’ websites, including those developed using our Software System Platform (source code), are owned entirely by the client(s).
 
Marketing Plan
 
Our marketing plan, at present, is not yet complete and is still being researched and developed. At present, our Company has been marketed solely through direct sales efforts by our Chief Executive Officer. These efforts have been constrained to marketing directly to the personal and professional acquaintances of our Chief Executive Officer.
 
We have as of yet undeveloped plans to further market our Software Platform Package online via social media and other relevant industry related websites and message boards. At present we do not have specific plans for the implementation of our marketing plan, the extent to which we will require capital for our marketing efforts, or when we will commence with the implementation of our pending marketing plan.
 
Future Plans
 
Our future plans, at present, are constrained to finalizing the details of our services and our Software System Package. We intend to develop pricing policies and strategies for the implementation of all the services we have detailed herein including the lease of our Software Platform Package. However, we do not have a specific timeline in place for how long it will take us to finalize such plans. Subsequent to finalizing our services, and our pricing, we will begin exploring methods through which we can begin to effectively market our services and our Software Platform Package. We also intend to hire additional employees, but we have no plans in place regarding the criteria for future staff members at this point in time. Our efforts to finalize a marketing plan and begin to hire additional employees will be an ongoing process.
 
Our first priority is to improve existing Software Platform Package which is owned by AIS Japan. On August 16, 2018, AIS Japan Co., Ltd., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a Software Development Agreement with Herol Gaibin, whereas Herol Gaibin will improve upon the Company’s existing Software Platform Package. The fee to further develop the software is in amount of 5,000,000 JPY (approximately $45,000). This agreement remains active but we cannot say with any level of certainty when these improvements will be completed. A few features that we intend to improve include, but are not limited to, creating new functions for ordering, improve flexibility for multiple cryptocurrencies, shorten development period, improve fault resistance of the system and to effectively use IT resources.
 
Properties
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 2-41-7-336, Shinsakae, Naka-ku Nagoya-shi, Aichi, 460-0007, Japan. This property is rented by the Chief Executive Officer and is provided to the Company free of charge.
Employees
 
Currently, we have a total of one full time employee and, through our subsidiary AIS Japan Co., LTD, one part time employee. Our full time employee is our Chief Executive Officer Mr. Takehiro Abe. He can currently, and intends to continue to, devote 40 hours per week to the Company. Our part time employee works on an hourly basis without benefits. We have tentative plans to hire additional employees on a need be basis that is currently unidentified.
