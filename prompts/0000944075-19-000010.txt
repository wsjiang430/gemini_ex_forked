General
 
Total employee headcount at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 56. We subcontract the manufacturing of all our product components to independent third-party contract manufacturers located in the United States, Mexico, Taiwan, Singapore, China and Malaysia that have the equipment, know-how and capacity to manufacture products to our specifications. We assemble, test and distribute our products from our facilities in Newark, California. Our products are sold through a worldwide network of distributors and on-line resellers, application developers, and value-added resellers.
 
We were founded in March 1992 as Socket Communications, Inc. and reincorporated in Delaware in 1995 prior to our initial public offering in June 1995. We have financed our operations since inception primarily from the sale of equity capital or convertible debt, receivables-based revolving lines of credit and in February 2018, a term loan with our bank. We began doing business as Socket Mobile, Inc. in January 2007 to better reflect our market focus on the mobile business market and changed our legal name to Socket Mobile, Inc. in April 2008. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “SCKT”. Our principal executive offices are located at 39700 Eureka Drive, Newark, CA 94560, and our phone number is (510) 933-3000. Our Internet home page is located at http://www.socketmobile.com; however, the information on, or that can be accessed through, our home page is not part of this Annual Report. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to such reports are available free of charge on or through our internet home page as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Marketing Dynamics
 
Developer Relationships. We actively support software application developers to integrate our products into their applications through our registered developer program. We provide an easy to use software developer kit (Capture SDK) and training and technical support to our registered developers. We support the marketing activities of our registered developers in promoting the applications that include our products. Once our data collection products are integrated into a developer’s application, our products become an ingredient of the application solution and part of the developer’s marketing program for that application. We provide regular Capture SDK updates including updates that support the latest operating system updates provided by Apple, Google and Microsoft. We spend extensive engineering time and resources to ensure that our cordless data capture products are compatible with a wide variety of the most popular smartphones, tablets and mobile computers running a variety of operating systems. We comply with the standards set by the standard-setting bodies whose technologies are used in our products such as Bluetooth SIG and NFC Forum.
 
Mobile Markets. Our revenues in 2018 and 2017 were primarily driven by sales of barcode scanners integrated into retail point of sale applications for use with Apple tablets and other mobile devices. Many point of sale application providers were funded by venture capital organizations to develop software for smaller retailers using tablets as cash registers. Small retailers are an underserved market for point of sale applications, enabling development and growth. Other mobile markets being addressed by registered developers include commercial services (field workers), asset tracking, manufacturing process and quality control, transportation and logistics (goods tracking and movement), event management (ticketing, entry, access control, and identification), medical and education. We expect these markets to increase the availability and use of mobile applications and the demand for mobile barcode scanners.

Cordless Barcode Scanning. We offer a full range of handheld cordless barcode scanners connecting to smartphones, tablets and other computing devices over Bluetooth. Our Software Developer Kit (Capture SDK) enables registered third-party application developers to integrate the features of our Data Capture software into their applications and helps differentiate our products. Our Cordless Barcode Scanners face competition from similar products from Koamtec, Code Corporation and Opticon (Japan). Barcodes may also be scanned using the built-in camera in smartphones or tablets with applications from Scandit or Manatee Works. However, scanning using the built-in camera is typically slower and harder to aim, especially as the camera pixel count gets larger. Users may choose a barcode scanner that connects directly to an Apple tablet, iPhone or computer such as offered by Infinite Peripherals and Honeywell. Users also may choose more rugged barcode scanners as an alternative, some of which are integrated into computing devices from manufacturers such as Datalogic, Honeywell®, and Zebra Technologies. Many of these devices are not Apple certified. Many connect to Apple devices over Bluetooth in keyboard emulation mode and do not offer extensive tools for software developers such as our software developer kit (Capture SDK) to integrate features of our sophisticated data collection scanning software into data capture applications.
 
Contactless RFID/NFC Reader/Writer. Socket Mobile developed and commenced sales in 2017 of a Contactless RFID/NFC Reader/Writer, D600 version of our durable handheld barcode scanner. The D600 can read and write many different types of electronic SmartTags which are used in many applications today, like digital wallet applications for loyalty cards, identification cards, payment cards, coupons and event tickets. We have also introduced a token exchanger S500 to facilitate transfer of electronic tokens. We are an early entrant into this market and do not face significant head to head competition from alternative reader and reader/writer devices.
 
Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property
 
We have been granted 37 U.S. patents and 11 design patents and have other patent applications under review. We have registered trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the mark “Socket”, our logo, DuraScan, and SocketScan.
 
We have developed technological building blocks that enhance our ability to design new hardware and software products, to offer products which run on multiple software and hardware platforms, and to manufacture and package products efficiently.
 
We own and control the design of our barcode scanners, enabling us to modify its features or software to meet specific customer requirements.
 
We have developed software programs that provide unique functions and features for our data collection products. For example, our data collection software enables our barcode scanning products to scan a variety of barcodes and to route the data to many different types of data files on operating systems used in Apple, Android and Windows mobile devices. We use Bluetooth technology to provide a completely functional Bluetooth solution enabling connections and data transfers between Bluetooth-enabled devices.
