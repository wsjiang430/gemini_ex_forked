ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

GENERAL
 SeaChange International, Inc., a Delaware corporation founded on July 9, 1993, is an industry leader in the delivery of multiscreen, advertising and premium over the top (“OTT”) video management solutions headquartered in Acton, Massachusetts. Our software products and services facilitate the aggregation, licensing, management and distribution of video and advertising content for service providers, telecommunications companies, satellite operators and broadcasters. We sell our software products and services worldwide, primarily to service providers including: operators, such as Liberty Global, plc.  (“LGI”), Altice NV, Cox Communications, Inc. and Rogers Communications, Inc.; telecommunications companies, such as Verizon Communications, Inc., AT&T, Inc. and Frontier Communications Corporation; satellite operators such as Direct TV and Dish Network Corporation; and broadcasters.
 Our software products and services are designed to empower video providers to create, manage and monetize the increasingly personalized, highly engaging experiences that viewers demand. Using our products and services, we believe customers can increase revenue by offering services such as video-on-demand (“VOD”) programming on a variety of consumer devices, including televisions (“TVs”), mobile telephones (“smart phones”), personal computers (“PCs”), tablets and OTT streaming players. Our solutions enable service providers to offer other interactive television services that allow subscribers to receive personalized services and interact with their video devices, thereby enhancing their viewing experience. Our products also allow our customers to insert advertising into broadcast and VOD content. 
 SeaChange serves an exciting global marketplace where multiscreen viewing is increasing, consumer device options are evolving rapidly, and viewing habits are shifting. The primary driver of our business is enabling the delivery of video assets in the changing multiscreen television environment. Through strategic collaborations, we have expanded our capabilities, products and services to address the delivery of content to devices other than television set-top boxes, namely PCs, tablets, smart phones and OTT streaming players. We believe that our strategy of expanding into adjacent product lines will also position us to further support and maintain our existing service provider customer base. Providing our customers with more scalable software platforms enables them to further reduce their infrastructure costs, improve reliability and expand service offerings to their customers. Additionally, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on new customers entering the multiscreen marketplace and increasingly serving adjacent markets. Our core technologies provide a foundation for software products and services that can be deployed in next generation video delivery systems capable of increased levels of subscriber activity across multiple devices. 
 In February 2019, we acquired Xstream A/S, a leading OTT media cloud platform provider with its primary operations in Warsaw, Poland. Xstream provides a managed service, OTT video solution that serves more than five million active subscribers globally. Xstream’s MediaMaker video platform will enhance the SeaChange end-to-end video framework. We intend to use the acquisition of Xstream to accelerate our penetration in OTT and new market segments with a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) revenue model and a fully cloud-based end-to-end video platform that operates in a hosted managed service environment. 
In May 2016, we acquired DCC Labs, a developer of set-top and multiscreen device software. This acquisition enabled us to optimize the operations of our In-Home business and centralize our worldwide engineering team in Warsaw, Poland. 
 We have initiated restructuring programs in the past three years, to help us improve operations and optimize our cost structure. Our restructuring programs in 2017 included the wind down of the Timeline Labs operations, inclusive of an impairment charge of long-lived assets related to the Timeline Labs operations, the reorganization of our engineering teams and other company-wide-cost savings initiatives resulting in annualized cost savings of $38 million and aggregate charges of $9 million. In fiscal 2019, we began taking steps to reduce our costs further for which we estimate restructuring charges will be approximately $2 million and for which we expect annualized costs savings of over $6 million.
 
Notwithstanding the success of our restructuring programs, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we experienced a decline in stock price and actual operating results and, accordingly, revised our forecasts.  These events were a trigger for an impairment review, as a result of which we determined that the carrying value of goodwill and certain long-lived assets exceeded their fair value, such that we recorded a $17.0 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our building, included in property, plant and equipment, the remaining net book value of our intangible assets and our goodwill to fair value.  The impact of this impairment charge is excluded from our non-GAAP operating results included in this report.
 In January 2019, we announced the appointment of Yossi Aloni as Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. In February 2019, Edward Terino resigned as our Chief Executive Officer and as a Director, effective February 24, 2019 and we created an interim Office of the CEO, to provide ongoing leadership and oversight of the day-to-day operations of the Company. The Office of the CEO included Yossi Aloni, Chief Commercial Officer; Peter Faubert, Chief Financial Officer; Marek Kielczewski, Chief Technology Officer; and David McEvoy, General Counsel. On April 4, 2019, we appointed our existing Director, Mark Bonney, to serve as

Executive Chair.  The Executive Chair serves as Chairman of the Board and principal executive officer.  In connection with that appointment, the Office of the CEO was eliminated and Mr. Markey resigned as Chairman of the Board though continues as a member of the Board of Directors.
 
On February 28, 2019, we entered into a Cooperation Agreement with TAR Holdings LLC and Karen Singer (collectively, “TAR Holdings”).  As of the date of the Cooperation Agreement, TAR Holdings beneficially owned approximately 20.6% of our outstanding common stock.  Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, we agreed to set the size of the Board at eight members, appoint Robert Pons to the Board as a Class II Director with a term to expire at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, and appoint Jeffrey Tuder to the Board as a Class III Director with a term to expire at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders.  Mr. Pons and Mr. Tuder were accordingly appointed to our Board upon execution of the Cooperation Agreement on February 28, 2019.
 
On March 4, 2019, our Board approved and adopted a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan to deter acquisitions of our common stock that would potentially limit our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes (“NOLs”) to reduce our potential future federal income tax obligations.  In connection with the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, we declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of our common stock issued and outstanding as of March 15, 2019 to our stockholders of record on that date.  The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan expires by its terms if not approved by our stockholders at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.
 PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
Our business is focused on the following product areas: video platform, content management, advertising and user experience. Our revenue sources consist of product revenue from these areas, as well as related services. We offer software products under two deployment options: onsite software licenses and a cloud-based offering through SaaS. 
Video Platform
 SeaChange Adrenalin Multiscreen Video Backoffice Platform. Adrenalin is a comprehensive software platform that enables service providers to manage, monetize and deliver a seamless viewing experience to subscribers across TVs, PCs, tablets, smart phones and other IP-enabled devices. Adrenalin is a modular software solution allowing customers to gradually adopt new functionality and features to expand multiscreen television distribution capabilities. 
 MediaMaker. MediaMaker is an OTT video cloud platform that enables operators, broadcasters, media companies and content owners  to ingest, manage, monetize and distribute their content across networks and devices. With its three modules, loading dock, store and play, MediaMaker provides core functionalities needed for an OTT business: Content Ingestion, Monetization and End-user Experience. 
 Content Management
 SeaChange AssetFlow Content Management Solution. In today’s multiscreen viewing environment, programming or advertisements are reproduced with numerous variants to serve the unique requirements of multiple network types, consumer devices and geographies. Metadata, such as poster, description and pricing, associated with the programming, is also managed by the platform. At the point of content ingest, our AssetFlow software is used to receive, manage and publish video content for viewing on televisions, tablets, PCs and other consumer devices. AssetFlow simplifies the increasingly complex tasks of movie and television program asset tracking, metadata management, and overall content workflow processing.
 Advertising 
 SeaChange Infusion Advanced Advertising Platform. As more video content is served to multiple consumer devices, the ability to generate additional revenue by inserting advertising across multiple platforms becomes crucial to service providers seeking to offset content rights costs and reduce subscriber fees for viewing the content. Infusion enables service providers to maximize advertising revenue across multiscreen, broadcast, on-demand and OTT viewing and reach their audiences while viewers watch content across multiple devices. 
User Experience
 SeaChange NitroX. NitroX empowers service providers and content owners to optimize live and on-demand video consumption on multiscreen and OTT services. Its features and functionality allow service providers to fully leverage the extensive content management, delivery and monetization capabilities of SeaChange’s platforms. NitroX products provide a ready-to-deploy

multiscreen user experience that is pre-integrated with SeaChange’s widely deployed Adrenalin or third-party multiscreen video platform.
 Services
 SeaChange offers comprehensive professional services, maintenance and support for all its products.  We have developed extensive capabilities in systems integration, implementation and customer engineering.  We also provide managed services capabilities offering end-to-end management of video platform in the cloud, including remote monitoring and proactive system maintenance, to help our customers quickly and confidently establish new on-demand and multiscreen capabilities.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 We have focused and streamlined our research and development efforts in recent years. We believe that our success will depend on our ability to develop and timely introduce new integrated solutions and enhancements to our existing products that meet changing customer requirements in our current and future customer base as well as new markets. We have made substantial investments in developing and bringing to market our next generation software products which utilize microservices-based software architectures and advanced orchestration. Our current research and development activities are focused on developing cloud-based multiscreen television platforms, content management solutions, additional user experience applications, advertising solutions and integrating the solutions we currently offer. The majority of our research and development efforts are performed in Warsaw, Poland.  
SELLING AND MARKETING 
 Our sales cycle has historically been long, in some instances 12-24 months. Purchase orders can be more than one million dollars and it can be difficult to predict in what fiscal period the sale will occur. While currently a small portion of our revenue, our newer SaaS offerings have shorter sales and deployment cycles as our customers’ subscribers are added to existing managed services in the cloud. These customers pay on a per-subscriber basis. We primarily utilize a direct sales process and work closely with customers to understand and define their needs. We use several marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of our products. We also market certain of our products to systems integrators and value-added resellers. We attend and exhibit our products at a limited number of prominent industry trade shows and conferences and we present our technology at seminars and smaller conferences to promote their awareness. 
OUR CUSTOMERS
 We currently sell our products primarily to video service providers, such as cable system operators and telecommunications companies, as well as content providers. Our customer base is highly concentrated among a limited number of large customers. A 
 6


significant portion of our revenue in any given fiscal period has been derived from substantial orders placed by these large organizations. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, Altice and LGI each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. 
 We expect that we will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue in the near future, even as we intend to penetrate new markets and customers. As a result of this customer concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the failure of anticipated orders to materialize and by deferrals or cancellations of orders because of changes in customer requirements or new product announcements or introductions. In addition, the concentration of customers may cause variations in revenue, expenses and operating results on a quarterly basis due to seasonality of orders, the timing and relative size of orders received and accepted during a fiscal quarter, or the timing and size of orders for which revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied during a fiscal quarter.
 COMPETITION 
 The markets in which we compete are characterized by intense competition, with many suppliers providing different types of products to different segments of the markets. In new markets for our products, we compete based on price, functionality and delivery capabilities. In markets in which we have an established presence, we compete principally based on the breadth of our products’ features and benefits, including the flexibility, scalability, professional quality, ease of use, reliability and cost effectiveness of our products, and our reputation and the depth of our expertise, customer service and support. While we believe that we currently compete favorably overall with respect to these factors and that our ability to provide integrated solutions to manage and distribute digital video differentiates us from our competitors, in the future we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with respect to these factors. 
 In the market for multiscreen video, we compete with various larger companies offering video platforms and applications such as Synamedia, Arris Group Inc., TiVo and MediaKind, as well as in-house solutions built by the service provider. Increasingly, we are also seeing competition from integrated end-to-end solutions and many OTT providers. We expect the competition in each of the markets in which we operate to intensify in the future with existing and new competitors with significant market presence and financial resources.
 Many of our current and prospective competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. Moreover, these companies may introduce additional products that are competitive with ours or enter strategic relationships to offer complete solutions. Therefore, our products may not be able to compete effectively with these products from these companies in the future. 
 
PROPRIETARY RIGHTS 
 Our success and our ability to compete are dependent, in part, upon the proprietary rights of our intellectual property. We currently have 24 patents worldwide. In addition, we rely on a combination of contractual rights, trademark laws, trade secrets and copyright laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products. It is possible that the validity of these patents would not be upheld. It is also possible that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be distributed do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Currently, we are not party to intellectual property litigation, but we may be a party to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or because of an allegation that we infringe others’ intellectual property.
EMPLOYEES
 As of January 31, 2019, we had 249 employees, of which 3 were part-time.  We also use other temporary employees and contractors in the ordinary course of our business. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Employees in certain foreign jurisdictions are represented by local works council as may be customary or required in those jurisdictions.
