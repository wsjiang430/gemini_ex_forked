Overview
 Our vision is a truly healthy society where mental and physical healthcare are unified to make lives better. Our mission is to help people lead healthier, more fulfilling lives by improving access to trusted, affordable and personalized mental health care. To fulfill this mission, we have built one of the nation’s largest outpatient mental health platforms based on number of clinicians and geographic scale.
 We are dedicated to improving the lives of our patients by reimagining mental health through a disruptive, tech-enabled in-person and virtual care delivery model built to expand access and affordability, improve outcomes and lower overall health care costs. We combine a personalized, digitally-powered patient experience with differentiated, multidisciplinary clinical capabilities and in-network insurance relationships to fundamentally transform patient access to mental health treatment. By revolutionizing the way mental health care is delivered, we believe we have, an opportunity to improve the lives and health of millions of individuals.
 We employed 5,631 licensed mental health clinicians through our subsidiaries and affiliated practices in 33 states as of December 31, 2022. Our clinicians offer patients a comprehensive, multidisciplinary suite of mental health services, spanning psychiatric evaluations and treatment, psychological and neuropsychological testing, and individual, family and group therapy. We treat a broad range of mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, psychotic disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. Patients can receive care virtually through our online delivery platform or in-person at one of our conveniently located centers. Through our payor relationships, including national agreements with multiple payors, patients can utilize their in-network benefits when they receive care from one of our clinicians, enhancing access and affordability.
 Mental illness is a large and growing crisis that creates a significant burden on the healthcare ecosystem. One in five U.S. adults and one in six youths will experience mental illness each year and over 50% of adults will experience mental health issues during their lifetime. This disease burden has a broader impact across all of healthcare—healthcare costs for individuals with mental health conditions, including depression, have been shown to be approximately three and a half times higher than for people without those conditions.
 However, there are significant barriers to addressing this crisis:
 •Lack of Access: Despite this large burden, access to mental health treatment is plagued by significant challenges. Even if patients are able to access a mental health professional, studies show they often face significant wait times. During this time, their underlying physical and mental health issues may worsen, potentially requiring treatment in costlier care settings like hospitals, emergency rooms and inpatient mental facilities.
 •Lack of Affordability: The mental healthcare market remains highly fragmented, forcing patients to pay cash out-of-pocket for treatment and, therefore, reducing the likelihood that patients will receive treatment.
 •Lack of Scale and Organization: Outpatient mental health is highly fragmented. We believe that independent clinicians are burdened with significant non-clinical business demands, including marketing, payor contracting, billing and collecting, and other administrative tasks, impeding their ability to focus on their patients’ care. A corresponding lack of resources to invest in infrastructure and technology exacerbates these burdens, even as growing regulatory and compliance requirements increase the need for them. This lack of technology further constrains access issues—for example, through limited or no virtual capabilities—while impeding the ability to effectively track patient data and outcomes as needed to ensure care is being delivered effectively.
 •Lack of Care Coordination: Many primary care physicians and specialists are not well-equipped to identify and treat patients with mental health conditions, resulting in many patients receiving treatments only once their condition has been exacerbated or not receiving treatment at all. This limited access to treatment has a significant social and economic impact.
 We founded LifeStance to solve these challenges. More broadly, we recognized that addressing this unmet need would require a transformation of how mental health care is built and delivered. We developed powerful incentives for each of our stakeholders—patients, clinicians, payors and primary care and specialist physicians—to align with our mission, adopt our platform and drive our growth.


We estimate that the outpatient mental healthcare market in the United States was approximately $116 billion as of 2020 and today there are over 50 million patients in the United States with a mental health issue that our clinicians could address. We expect that the market will nearly double from 2020 to 2025 at a compound annual growth rate of 14%, to approximately $215 billion.
 We Provide Patients Access to Convenient, Affordable, High-Quality Care
 We are the front-door to comprehensive outpatient mental health care. Our clinicians offer patients comprehensive services to treat mental health conditions across the clinical spectrum. Our in-network payor relationships improve patient access by allowing patients to access care without significant out-of-pocket cost or delays in receiving treatment. Our personalized, data-driven comprehensive care meets patients where they are through convenient virtual and in-person settings. We support our patients throughout their care continuum with purpose-built technological capabilities, including online assessments, digital provider communication, and seamless internal referral and follow-up capabilities.
We Empower Clinicians to Improve the Lives of Their Patients
 We empower clinicians to focus on patient care and relationships by providing what we believe is a superior workplace environment, as well as clinical and technology capabilities to deliver high-quality care. We offer a unique employment model for clinicians in a collaborative clinical environment—with clinicians employed by our subsidiaries and affiliated practices—and we improve patient access through in-network payor contracts and primary care and specialist physician referrals. Our integrated platform and national infrastructure reduce administrative burdens for clinicians while increasing engagement and satisfaction. Our digital platform enables collaboration across the clinician team. Our clinicians are dedicated to our mission—in 2021 and again in 2022, we were Certified by Great Place to Work, the global authority on workplace culture, employee experience and leadership behaviors.
We Reduce Costs for Payors and Their Members
 We partner with payors to deliver access to high-quality outpatient mental health care to their members at scale. Through our extensive scale, we offer payors a pathway to achieving these savings in the broader healthcare system. By offering access to our services, payors also have an opportunity to reduce their employer customers’ significant mental health costs arising from higher employee absenteeism and lower productivity.
We Enable Primary Care and Specialist Physicians to Deliver Superior Care
 We collaborate with primary care and specialist physicians to enhance patient care. Primary care is an important setting for the treatment of mental health conditions—primary care physicians are often the sole contact of patients with a mental illness. We partner with primary care physicians and specialist physician groups across the country to provide a mental healthcare network for referrals and, in certain instances, through co-location to improve the diagnosis and treatment of their patients.
 We Have an Opportunity to Transform Healthcare as a Whole
 To truly transform healthcare, the integration of mental and physical care is increasingly recognized as a critical priority. It is estimated that over one-third of all patients with chronic physical diseases have a co-occurring mental health disorder. Our scale, breadth of capabilities and value proposition to our key stakeholders position us to enable this transformation, which we are already undertaking. In certain instances, we co-locate our clinicians to facilitate seamless mental health care treatment and enable collaborative care consultation with other care providers. We have over 10 integrated care programs underway, including partnerships with Medicare Advantage plans, employers, and chronic care providers as we lead efforts that seek to demonstrate the ability of fully-integrated mental health models to improve holistic health outcomes. We envision a future where the coordination and delivery of mental and physical care is accomplished collaboratively between primary care and mental health providers to improve overall patient health, and we are actively working to lead the mental health industry in this direction.
 How We Generate Revenue
 We generate revenue on a per-visit basis when a patient receives care from one of our clinicians. Depending on the state, our clinicians are either employed directly through our subsidiaries or through our affiliated practices, for which we manage day-to-day operations pursuant to long-term management services contracts. Our revenue is generally derived from patients with in-network insurance coverage, pursuant to which our subsidiaries or affiliated practices are reimbursed for patient services. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 91% of our revenue was derived from patients with commercial in-network payors, 4% of our revenue was derived from patients with government payors, 4% of our revenue was derived from patients on a self-pay basis and 1% of our revenue was derived from non-patient services. Our contracts with payors are typically structured as fee-for-service arrangements, with negotiated reimbursement rates for our clinical services. With respect to our affiliated practices, our revenue is derived from management fees negotiated under our management services contracts. We believe we are well-positioned to grow our revenue by catering to each of our stakeholders and remaining focused on our patient-centered mission.
We Deliver Value for All Key Stakeholders in the Healthcare Ecosystem
 Our model is built to empower each of the healthcare ecosystem’s key stakeholders and align around our shared goal of delivering a healthier life for patients by creating access to high-quality mental health care.
Our Patients Gain Access to High-Quality Care When and Where They Need It
 Our clinicians treated more than 680,000 unique patients through approximately 5.7 million visits in 2022. We aim to deliver value to our patients in multiple ways:
 •Superior patient experience: We have a relentless focus on delivering a superior experience to our patients. We enable our patients to conveniently see their clinician through their preferred choice of virtual or in-person visits. We optimize patient engagement through our convenient digital tools, including online scheduling, adherence reminders, online prescription refills and online payments. We believe our centers are built to a superior standard that provides our patients with a best-in class visit experience. Enabling our patients and elevating their experience makes them more likely to seek help, resulting in higher engagement and an increased likelihood they will continue treatment. We believe our superior patient experience drives increased patient engagement—in 2022, 85% of our patients have had two or more visits with our clinicians.
 •Front door to comprehensive mental health care: We offer comprehensive, multidisciplinary access to a suite of services to meet our patients’ needs through their mental health care journey. Our patients have access to our comprehensive team of licensed mental health clinicians, including psychiatrists, advanced practice nurses ("APNs"), psychologists and therapists. We use a data-driven digital onboarding process to match patients with clinicians based on their needs and collaborate to develop medically-driven care plans. We believe our breadth of clinical capabilities enables superior coordination among disciplines to deliver our patients the best possible care.
 •Increased access and affordability through in-network coverage: We have national payor relationships, which improves access and affordability for our patients. Our in-network patients can seek initial mental health screening, clinical treatment and subsequent therapy or follow-up as needed in a timely manner appropriate for their needs.
Our Clinicians Are Empowered to Focus on Improving the Lives of Their Patients
 We deliver value to our clinicians through our "Seven Points of Value" clinician value proposition:
 •Mission-driven culture: Our platform enables our clinicians to focus on delivering the best possible care to their patients. We augment their ability to serve their patients through technology tools and data, while freeing them from the many non-clinical burdens they face in independent practice.
 •Collegial and collaborative: We promote a clinical culture of collaboration and ongoing learning for our team of mental health professionals. Our clinicians share evidence-based practices and meet regularly for continuing education and other collaborative opportunities for learning. They are also strongly supported to work together across disciplines to provide the most comprehensive and clinically effective care possible—often the most effective, evidence-based treatment modality is a combination of psychotherapy and psychiatric medication, and our mix of prescribers and non-prescribers supports the ability to provide optimal patient care.
 •Strong work-life balance: Our conveniently located centers and virtual care delivery platform provide our clinicians with greater flexibility and convenience to serve their patients in whatever environment is most suitable. This flexibility improves clinician engagement, efficiency and their overall working environment.
 •Enhanced digital tools: We have built a centralized operating platform that enables significant efficiencies for our clinicians, alleviating administrative burden, expanding availability for patient care and improving overall clinician satisfaction. Our unified electronic health record tracking platform, combined with our management of day-to-day operational aspects such as marketing, payor contracting, billing and collecting, intake, and scheduling, alleviates administrative burden and improves overall career engagement.
 •Robust support services: With our robust support services, we alleviate the administrative burden and free clinicians from the many nonclinical burdens they face in an independent practice, allowing them to dedicate their time to patient care.
 •Competitive compensation package: Our clinicians are employed as W-2 employees by our subsidiaries and affiliated practices rather than as independent contractors, the latter of which we believe is more common in the mental healthcare industry in the United States. Additionally, we offer a flexible visit-based economic model, which allows our clinicians to build their patient panels while flexibly managing caseloads in line with clinicians’ personal preferences.
 •Ownership mentality: We believe investing in our talent in human capital is paramount. Under our employee equity incentive program, we make grants to eligible employees, including clinicians. For clinicians, eligibility for equity awards and vesting are tied to productivity, directly serving our mission of expanding access to mental healthcare. We believe our equity program boosts our value proposition in a highly competitive labor market, can help attract and retain the talent needed for our patient-centric business model, and promotes an ownership mindset among our employees, including our clinicians. Just as critically, it aligns with our values and purpose and builds on a history of investment in 


our team by providing meaningful rewards for furthering our mission of enhancing access to mental healthcare in a sustainable manner over the long term.
 Our Payor Partners Expand Access and Lower Costs
 We have in-network payor relationships offering access to our clinician team. We deliver value to our payor partners in several ways:
 •Access to a national clinician employee base: We deliver a scaled and comprehensive mental health care offering with an appropriate mix of psychiatric and therapeutic expertise to offer to their members and employer clients.
 •Lower total medical costs: Long-term analyses demonstrate that incremental spend on mental health care for patients results in significantly higher savings in total health care costs. As a result, improving access and coverage of mental health care represents a large cost containment opportunity with a compelling return on investment.
 •Stronger member and client value proposition: We believe our clinicians provide best-in-class mental health treatment services and experience, which enables payors to provide to their members a superior product. Because mental health conditions can lead to employee absenteeism and lower productivity, we believe our payor partners are also well-positioned to deliver value to their employer clients.
 Our Primary Care and Specialist Physician Partners Can More Effectively Improve the Lives of their Patients
We partner with primary care physicians and specialist physician groups, to deliver improved health outcomes for our shared patients:
 •More efficient referral base: We offer our primary care and specialist partners an extensive mental health clinician base for their patients, enabling their patients to receive the best total care across their mental and physical health needs. As we scale nationally, large provider groups can partner with us to streamline their mental health referrals. By having access to our extensive clinical team, primary care and specialist physicians can more easily and consistently connect patients to our clinicians throughout the course of their care.
 •Enable more integrated care and lower costs: We believe mental and physical health care integration may help lower costs to our primary care physician partners under reimbursement models where reimbursement rates are tied to quality and value-based outcomes. Our collaborative care model, through our partnerships with primary care physicians, other specialists and payor partners, aims to improve early diagnosis of mental health conditions to drive identification and better treatment, which may lead to improved quality outcomes and lower costs.
Our Growth Strategies
 We believe we are well positioned to sustain our strong track record of growth and accomplish our mission to reimagine mental health care in the United States. To achieve this, we are anchored on our vision to deliver the highest-quality care for our patients and our value proposition to our key stakeholders.
Highly Scalable Platform with Proven Growth Playbook
 We believe we have developed a highly replicable playbook that allows us to enter new markets and pursue growth through multiple vectors. To enter new markets, we generally seek to establish our clinician base in those markets by acquiring high-quality practices with a track record of clinical excellence and in-network payor relationships.
 Once we enter a market, we build market density by hiring or acquiring clinicians in that market. To drive growth in our clinician base, we have developed an in-house clinician recruiting model that is built on our compelling clinician value proposition. Our proprietary pipeline of clinician groups around the country also provides us with the opportunity to selectively expand our clinician base via tuck-in acquisitions. We believe our guiding principle of creating a national platform built with a patient and clinician focus makes us the partner of choice for smaller, independent practices.
 In addition to acquiring and expanding existing practices, we open de novo centers to provide physical locations for our clinicians to deliver on our hybrid model of in-person or virtual care. From our inception through December 31, 2022, we have successfully opened 316 de novo centers and completed 90 acquisitions of existing practices.
 Our clinician productivity drives center profitability, as evidenced by our de novo centers generating an attractive and predictable return on investment.
 Expand Presence in Our Existing Markets
 We believe we have built a powerful market growth engine that allows us to rapidly grow our presence within our markets and unlock potential latent demand through our differentiated scale, access and affordability. We have a significant opportunity to scale within our existing footprint. Our investments in technology are a critical component of our growth, improving our patient and clinician experience and enabling us to leverage our platform scale to expand our reach. Our virtual and in-person care model allows

us to optimize our utilization within our existing center and clinician footprint while flexibly scaling our platform capacity across our markets to meet demand. Our existing payor and primary care physician relationships further support this rapid growth by improving our patient access as we grow in our markets. Our unified technology and operational platform is also highly scalable, helping us sustain our rapid growth.
 Enter into New Markets
 We believe our model is highly replicable nationally. We identify new markets based on the core characteristics of attractive patient population demographics, substantial clinician recruiting opportunities, untreated patient communities and a diverse group of payors. We are able to enter new markets and grow our clinician base in those markets via acquisitions of clinician groups and through clinician hiring. Acquired centers and de novo centers provide a physical location for our clinicians, allowing care to be delivered in-person or virtually based on optimal patient care. Our multiple national payor contracts ensure we have immediate in-network coverage in our new markets, transforming patient access and unlocking potential latent demand. The highly fragmented nature of our industry provides us with significant opportunity to build and expand our presence across the United States.
 Consistent with the corporate practice of medicine doctrine, in certain states, we acquire and operate some of our centers as affiliated practices.
Grow Our Partnerships with Key Stakeholders
 We enjoy preferred national relationships with payors based on our scale, comprehensive service offering and ability to integrate mental health care. We are focused on improving the lives of our patients through validated outcomes that enable health care cost savings and further increasing our value as a partner to payors, primary care and specialist physicians and employers. Our goal is to continue to closely integrate mental and physical care. We believe that increased integration across the industry could enable payors to realize their population health goals and enable our primary care and specialist physician partners to successfully operate within value-based care and outcomes-driven reimbursement models. As we continue to grow, we see an opportunity to augment the scope of our relationships with each of our stakeholders. We believe our deepening relationships with each of these key health care stakeholders will further drive our success as we benefit from continued growth in our patient referral networks.
Advance Integrated Care Models
 We are currently pioneering collaborative care models with our payor partners in several of our markets, embedding mental health clinicians into primary care centers to evaluate and treat patients in a single setting. In certain instances, we co-locate our clinicians in primary care and specialist offices. We are also in programs with partners in certain chronic disease populations to identify and treat co-occurring mental health conditions, with the goal of improving overall health outcomes. Over time, our goal is to continue to evolve our offering toward a fully-integrated care model in which primary care and specialist physicians and mental health clinicians work together to develop and provide personalized treatment plans for shared patients. By collaborating as a team for shared patients, we believe we will not only be able to provide a seamless response to patients’ needs in a unified practice but also deliver better outcomes and lower overall medical costs.
Our Integrated Platform Is Reimagining Mental Health
 We have purpose-built an integrated platform to reimagine how mental health care is delivered. Our patient-focused platform combines differentiated clinical capabilities with a personalized, digitally-powered patient experience designed to transform patient access and treatment.
Extensive Scale, Breadth and Access
 We are reimagining access to mental health care in the United States. We are one of the nation’s largest providers of outpatient mental health care in the country based on the number of clinicians we employ through our subsidiaries and our affiliated practices and our geographic scale, employing 5,631 dedicated clinicians in 33 states, as of December 31, 2022. In 2022, our clinicians treated more than 680,000 unique patients through approximately 5.7 million visits. We serve all patient demographics through a comprehensive suite of mental health services to treat the most common mental health conditions. Our care delivery model enables patient access via virtual or in-person visits, at their convenience. We believe the scale, breadth and depth of our offering is unmatched in our industry.
Our Clinicians
 We strive to provide a best-in-class working environment for our 5,631 employed psychiatrists, APNs, psychologists and therapists. We believe our dedicated employment model offers a superior value proposition compared to independent practice. We employ a comprehensive range of mental health professionals to provide multi-disciplinary clinical modalities through our subsidiaries and our affiliated practices. We serve all patient demographics—children, adolescents, adults and geriatrics. Patients have seamless access to our team of licensed mental health clinicians, including psychiatrists, APNs, psychologists and therapists. Our breadth of clinical capabilities facilitates coordination across psychiatric and psychotherapy treatment modalities, limiting the need to refer patients externally as their needs are met within our comprehensive service offerings. Our clinicians have access to our digital

platform, which allows for shared electronic medical records for internal communication, and facilitates patient referrals within our clinician team, both of which support our collaborative approach to care.
Our Clinical Services
 We offer a comprehensive suite of services to meet patients’ needs across their mental health care journey. Our clinicians provide services spanning psychiatric evaluations and treatment, psychological and neuropsychological testing, and individual, family and group therapy. We treat a broad range of mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, psychotic disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. We use evidence-based approaches to ensure effective treatment.
Our Digital Strategy
 We believe that, while advanced digital capabilities are an essential part of the future of mental health care delivery, it is difficult to replicate and replace the in-person, human aspect of care. As a result, we have built a holistic, people-driven, digitally enabled care experience.
 From the first interaction with LifeStance, our digital capabilities enable us to improve patient access, match patients with clinicians more efficiently and successfully, inform clinician decisions through data-driven insights and streamline referrals and consultations.
 We are uniting virtual and in-person treatment with the goal to redefine the delivery of mental care for consumers across the ecosystem—one that delivers virtual engagement as personalized and human as the best in-person visits, and in-person visits as simple and seamless as the best digital experiences.
Across our digital pathways, through our ability to increase access to care and lower the cost of treatment, we believe LifeStance delivers distinct value today, while continuing to shape and bring to life a vision for potentially even greater value in the future.
Our Hybrid Care Delivery Model
 We deliver comprehensive care to our patients through a seamless and convenient virtual and in-person experience that allows patients to choose how they access their treatment. Within our care delivery model, patients can easily switch from virtual to in-person care due to unforeseen circumstances—for example, if they are delayed at work, traveling or at home with an ill child—which improves continuity of care. This flexibility is especially critical in certain circumstances when, for example, a patient changes medications and a two-week follow-up is necessary to ensure effectiveness. Our hybrid virtual and in-person delivery model is also crucial in treating certain mental health conditions, such as active substance abuse, eating disorders and autism, where we believe in-person treatment is essential to generate successful outcomes compared to virtual-only delivery models.
Our Centers
 When they choose to do so, our patients can receive in-person care at one of our 619 centers, both acquired and de novo. Currently, our typical de novo center comprises 3,500 to 4,500 square feet and 10 to 12 clinician exam rooms. We aim systematically to locate our de novo centers within a given market to ensure convenient coverage for in-person access to care. To provide our patients and clinicians with flexibility, our centers are generally open five days a week from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. local time, with some open on Saturdays. Each de novo center offers a comprehensive clinical care team of clinicians offering psychiatric and psychotherapy services.
 We aim to provide a superior in-person patient experience. Our de novo centers are built and fully outfitted to architectural design standards to create a comfortable and welcoming experience for our patients and clinicians that is replicated across our markets. Our spaces are compassionate, human-centric environments, thoughtfully designed to support best practices in mental health care, while providing a collaborative and inclusive backdrop for patients and clinicians alike.
 Our Virtual Care
 To enhance patient access, we offer patients the ability to conduct a given visit with their clinician virtually. Our virtual visit experience is convenient and easy to use. Patients can schedule their visit online and are able to conduct their visit via our digital platform at the time of their appointment from their computer, mobile device or tablet. In advance of their appointments, patients are sent an automatic reminder via text or e-mail, depending on their preference, with a link to launch the visit. We further optimize patient engagement through our convenient digital tools, including online messaging, adherence reminders, online prescription refills and online payments. Our patient portal allows patients and clinicians to communicate regularly, which is critical in a variety of circumstances, including for example, to help prevent errors in medication dosing and compliance. By offering these accessible tools, we believe patients are more likely to seek care and maintain appointments, driving further engagement and improving health outcomes.
Our Patient Acquisition Strategy
 We focus on driving growth in our patient base primarily through two avenues: pursuing contracts with payors on a national, regional and local level; and our development of referral relationships with physicians, most notably in primary care, as well as specialist physicians.
Our Payor Relationships
We have a large and diverse base of national, regional and local payors. Our dedicated payor relationship team is divided into three regions to ensure that strong relationships with regional operations teams and insurance companies are cultivated. Our payor contracting teams consist of professionals with decades of experience working with large national payors. We believe this expertise is critical to allowing our team to engage with payors more effectively than other providers. Our teams negotiate, implement and manage new payor relationships, drive regional rate improvement and advance key initiatives. We enter into individually negotiated regional contracts with regional entities comprising national payors. Two payors individually exceeded 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022: UnitedHealthcare and Anthem, comprising 19% and 14%, respectively. Our contracts with payors are generally fee-for-services arrangements. Only a nominal number of our contracts provide for incremental payments tied to the attainment of quality or performance metrics, and such payments comprised an immaterial portion of our revenue during the period.
Our Physician Relationships
 We have a large base of regional referring primary care physicians, specialist physicians and other network providers. Within our markets, we partner with primary care practice groups, specialists, health systems and academic institutions to refer patients to our centers and clinicians. To achieve this we have center leadership teams that build and maintain relationships with our referring partner networks. These teams focus primarily on creating awareness of our platform and services including existing and new centers as well the introduction of newly hired clinicians with appointment availability. When establishing new centers, we seek to build relationships with proximally located primary care and specialty offices as well as psychiatric hospitals to raise awareness. We achieve this through in-person visits as well as offline and online marketing.
Our Marketing Efforts
 We also use marketing strategies to develop our national brand to increase brand awareness and promote additional channels of patient recruitment. Our channel marketing strategies are online through web, social media and paid social ad campaigns and search engines, including direct-to-consumer paid search optimization. Clinicians accepting new patients can be booked for appointments directly online. We also hand out a limited number of printed brochures or other marketing materials to raise awareness of the Company locally.
Organization
 Some states have laws that prohibit business entities with non-physician owners from practicing medicine, which are generally referred to as the corporate practice of medicine. See “—Government Regulation—Corporate Practice and Fee-Splitting.” In states where we are not subject to corporate practice of medicine laws, we operate our business through centers that are wholly owned by our subsidiaries. In states where the corporate practice of medicine doctrine applies, in order to comply with such laws, we do not own the centers or directly employ the clinicians. Instead, such practices are owned by Dr. Anisha Patel-Dunn, our Chief Medical Officer, or other licensed clinical leadership employees. However, we own substantially all of the non-medical assets of the center and enter into a long-term management services contract with the center pursuant to which we provide all the management services to the center that it needs to operate, with the exception of medical or clinical services. As of December 31, 2022, 373 of our 619 centers were operated as affiliated practices. We manage our wholly-owned centers and affiliated practices consistently and generally do not distinguish between our wholly-owned centers and affiliated practices in operating our business, subject to compliance with applicable law.
 Our subsidiaries directly employ the clinicians who practice at our wholly-owned centers, whereas, with respect to our affiliated practices, our affiliated practices directly employ the clinicians. Any payment to a clinician at an affiliated practice is made pursuant to the clinician’s employment agreement with the affiliated practice (not through the management services contract).
 Payor Agreements
 We and our affiliated practices have payor relationships across multiple independent regional and national contracts. These relationships allow members to utilize their in-network benefits when such individual elects to receive service from one of our clinicians. As of December 31, 2022, our contracts with payors typically provide for an initial term of one to three years and auto-renewal thereafter for additional one year terms, with a majority of those agreements in automatic annual renewal stages. The contracts with our two largest payor partners are entered into on substantially consistent terms. In most markets, our practices have been contracted (in-network with payors) for more than a decade. While length of contract and economic terms are often negotiated, payors generally use form contracts that contain terms and conditions that are standard in the industry. A small number of our agreements with payors also include terms and conditions to incentivize us and facilitate our ability to provide quality care to that plan’s members, with modest bonus payments tied to quality or utilization metrics.
 The contracts governing the relationships with our payors include terms such as the period of performance, reimbursement rates and termination clauses. Typically, these contracts provide for a pre-determined fee based on a negotiated fee for service schedule or a customary charge that is typically a certain percentage of the fees specified in the CMS Medicare Physician Fee Schedule that is charged to the patient and the payor when a patient covered by the payor obtains services from one of our clinicians.


Many of our contracts are terminable for convenience by either the payor or us after a notice period has passed. The related notice period in our contracts is negotiated on a case-by-case basis and is dependent on many factors, some of which are outside of our control. Most of our contracts include cure periods for certain breaches, during which time we may attempt to resolve any issues that would trigger a payor’s ability to terminate the contract. Certain of our contracts may be terminated immediately by the payor if we lose applicable licenses, go bankrupt, lose our liability insurance, become insolvent, file for bankruptcy or receive an exclusion, suspension or debarment from state or federal government authorities. Additionally, if a payor were to lose applicable licenses, go bankrupt, lose liability insurance, become insolvent, file for bankruptcy or become excluded, suspended or debarred by state or federal government authorities, our contract with such payor could in effect be terminated. The loss, termination or renegotiation of any contract could negatively impact our results. In addition, as payors’ businesses respond to market dynamics and financial pressures, and as they make strategic business decisions in respect of the lines of business they pursue and programs in which they participate, we expect that certain of our payors will, from time to time, seek to restructure their agreements with us.
 The contracts with our payors impose other obligations on us. For example, we typically agree that all services provided under the payor contract and all employees providing such services will comply with the payor’s policies and procedures. Further, upon termination, we are generally obligated to continue the provision of covered services to a member for a certain amount of time or a given event, for example, for a period of 60 days or until the member is discharged from services. In addition, in most instances, we have agreed to indemnify our payors against certain third-party claims, which may include claims relating to the services performed under the agreement.
 Competition
 The market for mental health services is competitive. We compete in a highly fragmented market with direct and indirect competitors that offer varying levels of impact to key stakeholders such as patients, clinicians, payor partners and physician partners. Our competitors primarily include other mental health providers that deliver services virtually or in-person. Our indirect competitors also include episodic consumer-driven point solutions, such as in-person and virtual life coaching, digital therapy and support tools and other technologies related to mental health care. As the demand and market for mental health services continue to grow, we may also face competition from new market entrants, including major retailers that have recently begun to offer in-person and virtual mental health care in certain markets. However, as our market grows, new stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem could provide increased partnership opportunities for us. Each of the individual geographic areas in which we operate has a different competitive landscape. In each of our markets we compete with other mental health providers for patients and in contracting with commercial payors. In addition, we face intense competition from other clinical practices, hospitals, health systems and other outpatient mental health providers in recruiting psychiatrists, APNs, psychologists, therapists, and other health care professionals.
 The principal competitive factors in our industry include:
 •patient engagement and satisfaction;
 •quality outcomes for patients;
 •comprehensive digital tools;
 •ability to negotiate favorable reimbursement rates;
 •convenience, accessibility and availability;
 •brand awareness and reputation;
 •technology capabilities;
 •ability to attract and retain quality clinicians;
 •employment models;
 •geographic footprint;
 •level of participation in insurance plans;
 •scalability of models; and
 •financial resources and stability.
 We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors and we believe the offerings of competitors inadequately simultaneously address the needs of key stakeholders or fail to do so at scale. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We operate in a competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.”


Government Regulation
 The healthcare industry and the practice of medicine are governed by an extensive and complex framework of federal and state laws, which continue to evolve and change over time. The costs and resources necessary to comply with these laws are high. Our profitability depends in part upon our ability to operate in compliance with applicable laws and to maintain all applicable licenses. As the applicable laws and rules change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. In some jurisdictions where we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model has been the subject of formal judicial or administrative interpretation. A review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities could result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or health care regulatory environment may change in a way that impacts our operations.
Practice of Medicine
 Corporate Practice and Fee-Splitting
 The corporate practice of medicine prohibition exists in some form, by statute, regulation, board of medicine or attorney general guidance, or case law, in certain of the states in which we operate. These laws generally prohibit the practice of medicine or practice of psychology by lay-persons or entities and are intended to prevent unlicensed persons or entities from interfering with or inappropriately influencing providers’ professional judgment.
 In these states, we contract with affiliated practices, who in turn employ or retain licensed clinicians and other staff to deliver mental health care services to patients. We enter into management contracts with our affiliated practices pursuant to which we provide a wide range of administrative services and receive payment from our affiliated practices. These administrative services arrangements are subject to state laws, including those in certain of the states where we operate, which prohibit the practice of medicine and the corporate practice of psychology by, and/or the splitting of professional fees with, non-professional persons or entities such as general business corporations.
 Corporate practice and fee-splitting prohibitions vary widely from state to state. In addition, such prohibitions are subject to broad powers of interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Our failure to comply could lead to adverse action against us and/or our clinicians by courts or state agencies, civil or criminal penalties, loss of clinician licenses, or the need to restructure our business model and/or clinician relationships, any of which could harm our business.
 Practice of Medicine and Provider Licensing
 The practice of medicine and the practice of psychology are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and requirements, including, among other things, laws relating to quality and adequacy of care, clinical personnel, supervisory requirements, mental health, medical equipment, and the prescribing and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances.
Telehealth Provider Licensing, Medical Practice, Certification and Related Laws and Guidelines
 Clinicians who provide professional medical services to a patient via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice medicine in the state in which the patient is located. Federal and state laws also limit the ability of clinicians to prescribe pharmaceuticals and controlled substances via telehealth. We have established systems for ensuring that our affiliated clinicians are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to our members occurs in each instance in compliance with applicable rules governing telehealth. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to adverse action against our clinicians, which could harm our business model and/or clinicians relationships and have a negative impact on our business.
State and Federal Health Information Privacy and Security Laws
 HIPAA
 We must comply with various federal and state laws related to the privacy and security of personal identifiable information ("PII"), including health information. In particular, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information ("PHI") and requires the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI. HIPAA’s requirements are also directly applicable to the contractors, agents, and other business associates of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI in connection with their provision of services to covered entities. Certain of our entities and affiliated practices are covered entities, while our management service entities are business associates.
 Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties. The civil penalties include civil monetary penalties of up to $63,973 per violation, not to exceed $1,919,173 for violations of the same standard in a single calendar year (as of 2022, and subject to periodic adjustments for inflation), and in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment. However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards.
 We are also subject to the HIPAA breach notification rule, which requires covered entities to notify affected individuals of breaches of unsecured PHI. In addition, covered entities must notify the Office of Civil Rights ("OCR") and the local media if a

breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to OCR on an annual basis. The HIPAA regulations also require business associates to notify the covered entity of breaches by the business associate.
 Many states in which we operate have their own laws protecting the privacy and security of personal information, including health information. We must comply with such laws in the states where we do business in addition to our obligations under HIPAA. In some states, such as California, state privacy laws are even more protective than HIPAA. It may sometimes be necessary to modify our operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. State data privacy and security laws are subject to change, and we could be subject to financial penalties and sanctions if we fail to comply with these laws.
 42 C.F.R. Part 2 and Other Privacy Laws
 The Federal Substance Abuse Confidentiality Regulations known as 42 C.F.R. Part 2 serve to protect patient records created by federally assisted programs for the treatment of substance use disorders. The federal government could initiate criminal charges for violations of Part 2, which include $500 for the first offense; and $5,000 for all subsequent offenses and seek fines up to $5,000 per violation for individuals and $10,000 per violation for organizations. Under the CARES Act, Congress also gave the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") the authority to issue civil monetary penalties for violations of Part 2, ranging from $100 to $50,000 per violation depending on the level of culpability.
 In addition to federal and state laws protecting the privacy and security of personal information, we may be subject to other types of federal and state privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security, along with laws that impose specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting.
 In recent years, there have been a number of well publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of PII and PHI. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials and provide credit monitoring services and/or other relevant services to impacted individuals. In addition, under HIPAA and pursuant to the related contracts that we enter into with our clients who are covered entities, we must report breaches of unsecured PHI to our clients following discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made in certain circumstances to affected individuals, federal authorities and others.
 Association and network rules
 In addition to the applicable privacy and data security laws, we may be subject to card association rules and regulations. For example, an independent standards-setting organization, the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) Security Standards Council developed a set of comprehensive requirements concerning payment card account security through the transaction process, called the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ("PCI DSS"). All merchants and service providers that store, process and transmit payment card data are required to comply with PCI DSS as a condition to accepting credit cards. We must implement certain data security measures and are subject to annual reviews to ensure compliance with PCI standards worldwide and are subject to fines if we fail to maintain a valid certificate or are otherwise are found to be non-compliant.
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Federal Stark Law
 We are subject to the federal physician Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for the provision of certain “designated health services” if the referring physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship (including an ownership interest or a compensation arrangement) with the entity, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means intent to violate the law is not required. In addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of various fraud, waste, and abuse laws, including the Stark Law, can be considered a predicate legal violation to submission of a false claim under the federal False Claims Act (described below) on the grounds that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws and rules when submitting claims for reimbursement. Penalties for violating the Stark Law may include: denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the law, recoupments of monies paid for such services, civil penalties for each violation and three times the dollar value of each such service, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs. Violations of the Stark Law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
 We are also subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which, subject to certain exceptions known as “safe harbors,” prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate or other remuneration, in cash or in kind, in return for, or to induce, the (1) the referral of a person covered by government health care programs, (2) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under government health care programs, or (3) the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging or recommending the purchasing, leasing, or ordering, of any item or service reimbursable under government health care programs. Federal courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute can be violated if just one purpose of a payment is to induce

referrals. Actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it is not required, which makes it easier for the government to prove that a defendant had the state of mind required for a violation. In addition to a few statutory exceptions, the Office of Inspector General ("OIG") of the HHS has promulgated safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute, provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of a financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute, but business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all elements of a safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by OIG and other enforcement authorities. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from government health care programs as well as civil and criminal penalties, including fines of $112,131 per violation (as of 2022, and subject to periodic adjustments for inflation) and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources comply with current law and available interpretative guidance, as a practical matter, it is not always possible to structure our arrangements so as to fall squarely within an available safe harbor.
 False Claims Act
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims to government programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid. In addition, the improper retention of an overpayment for 60 days or more is also a basis for a False Claim Act action, even if the claim was originally submitted appropriately. Some states have adopted similar fraud and false claims laws. Government agencies engage in significant civil and criminal enforcement efforts against health care companies under the False Claims Act and other civil and criminal statutes. False Claims Act investigations can be initiated not only by the government, but by private parties through qui tam (or whistleblower) lawsuits. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines ranging from $12,537 to $25,076 per false claim or statement (as of 2022, and subject to annual adjustments for inflation), plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government. Violations of the False Claims Act violations can also result in exclusion from participation in government health care programs.
State Fraud, Waste and Abuse Laws
 Several states in which we operate have also adopted similar fraud, waste, and abuse laws to those described above. The scope and content of these laws vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities. Some states’ fraud and abuse laws, known as “all-payor laws,” are not limited to government health care programs, but apply more broadly to items or services reimbursed by any payor, including commercial insurers. Liability under state fraud, waste, and abuse laws could result in fines, penalties, and restrictions on our ability to operate in those jurisdictions.
Other Health Care Laws
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"), and their implementing regulations, includes several separate criminal penalties for making false or fraudulent claims to non-governmental payors. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program, which includes private payors. Violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from government health care programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme, or device, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services. Violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. This statute could be used by the government to assert criminal liability if a health care provider knowingly fails to refund an overpayment.
 In addition, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, (1) inappropriate billing of services to government health care programs, (2) employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in government health care programs, and (3) offering or providing Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries with any remuneration, including full or partial waivers of co-payments and deductibles, that are likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier (subject to an exception for non-routine, unadvertised co-payment and deductible waivers based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts).
 State Health Care Competition and Planning Laws
 Several states in which we operate have adopted competition and health care planning laws that affect transactions in the health care industry. Some states require notification, filings, and/or approvals by state agencies with respect to proposed transactions involving health care providers. Such processes can take significant time, require filing fees, result in conditions that require certain operational changes, and include regular annual reviews regarding the cost and quality of services, among other topics. These laws and the level of enforcement by the respective state agencies are subject to continuous change and interpretation, and compliance with these laws could adversely affect our business.
Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property is an important asset of the Company that enables us to develop, market, and sell our services and enhance our competitive position. We rely on trademarks, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 LifeStance Health was certified by the Great Place to Work Institute for the second consecutive year in December 2022. When asked what makes LifeStance Health a Great Place to Work, our employees reported that they most valued Flexibility, Team Culture, feeling Supported and having special Benefits. In addition, more than 80% of employees said, “I feel I make a difference here" and “I can be myself around here.”
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 7,830 employees through our subsidiaries and affiliated practices, of which 3,967 were directly employed through our subsidiaries and 3,863 were directly employed by our affiliated practices. The clinicians of our affiliated practices have entered into employment agreements directly with our affiliated practices. All employees of our subsidiaries and affiliated practices are located in the United States. We engage temporary employees, independent contractors and consultants as needed to support our operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
 At LifeStance Health, we are building a culture that represents our values:
 •Delivering Compassion - we care for people unconditionally and act with empathy always
 •Building Relationships - we are collaborative, building enduring relationships to achieve more together
 •Celebrating Difference - we respect the diversity of every individual's lived experiences
 Guided by the Great Place to Work dimensions of well-being, we have developed a holistic approach to caring for our employees, community and environment through a programmatic focus on wellness:
 Physical and Mental Wellness: Over the last year, we redesigned our medical benefits plan to improve affordability and access including lower out-of-pocket expense for dependent coverage, family planning and care navigation for employees and their families. We also implemented a flexible time-off plan and made up to 20 mental healthcare visits free of charge for medical plan participants. In addition, we offer a peer-to-peer support line for colleagues in need of support.
 In a Future of Work Study conducted at mid-year which included a survey and focus groups with current employees as well as feedback from former employees, LifeStance employees were most satisfied with work-life balance, demonstrating the support they feel for flexibility and autonomy at work, each of which is a critical attribute to preventing burnout.
 Financial Wellness: As mental healthcare providers, we understand that financial stress can contribute to anxiety and depression, two of the leading diagnoses we see in our practices. To support financial wellness, we implemented an industry leading Long-Term Incentive Plan for LifeStance clinicians to earn stock awards as an incentive for increasing access to mental healthcare through their services. We believe providing a path to ownership in LifeStance Health is a differentiated benefit for our clinicians and other eligible employees. In further support of our programmatic approach, we developed a financial education series to help our employees understand how to optimize total compensation, learn about stock-based compensation and promote long-term financial wellness.
 Community Wellness: Building upon our approach to corporate philanthropy after the endowment of the LifeStance Health Foundation in 2021, we increased engagement in pro-social giving through two primary programs over the last year. First, we continued to promote Giving Thanks—a peer-to-peer recognition program to recognize colleagues for how they make lives better. For our end-of-year Giving Thanks campaign, participants could nominate a non-profit to receive a grant from LifeStance Health Foundation. The LifeStance Health Foundation granted awards to 120 non-profit organizations, in support of the causes most important to our employees, through this program.
 Second, we partnered with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention ("ASFP") for a matching campaign in support of AFSP's Walk Out of Darkness community walks. LifeStance employees formed walk teams across the country and helped AFSP surpass their fundraising goal including our local fundraising efforts and a $50,000 matching donation. Raising awareness for suicide prevention and supporting families coping with suicide loss is such a meaningful mission for our mental healthcare providers and all of our teams working together to make lives better.
 The combination of pro-social giving, participating in local fundraising activities and seeing the impact of our teams nationwide is how we are not only building community within LifeStance, but also living our value of Delivering Compassion in the communities we serve.
 Environment, Social and Governance ("ESG"): We are making important progress to be a leader in our industry. Last year, our Board of Directors delegated our Nominating and Governance Committee responsibility for oversight of our ESG strategy. One way that we are developing our ESG policy is to focus on the environmental impact of our 619 centers. Our new locations utilize materials

known for their sustainability practices including Declare certified (and Living Building Challenge compliant) ceiling tiles and grid; SUSTAIN high performance sustainable ceiling systems; Resilient Floor Covering Institute (RFCI) industry average Environmental Product Declaration flooring; Environmental Product Declaration Certified wall base; FloorScore Certified low emitting materials; low or zero VOC paint; and all high-efficiency LED lighting to minimize power consumption.
 Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging: At LifeStance, culture starts with leadership—one-third of our executive leadership team and Board of Directors are diverse by gender or race/ethnicity.
 Our National Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI") Committee is guided by the vision of fostering a workplace in which individuals of all backgrounds are welcomed by a culture of inclusion and respect. Our National DEI Committee is focused on education, cultural humility, celebrating difference and taking effective action to ensure every staff member and patient under our care understands that LifeStance is a safe place for them to be their authentic selves.
 In collaboration with our National DEI Committee, our in-house Training, Education and Professional Development team developed new content and training modules informed by our value of Celebrating Difference including a proprietary Unconscious Bias training for all employees. Our community-based approach to learning enables employees to build relationships across locations and workplaces, ensuring equity for employees whether working in-person or remotely.
 LifeStance employees are deeply compassionate, dedicated advocates for mental health and overall well-being. Together we are making significant progress on our vision for a truly healthy society where mental and physical healthcare are united to make lives better.
 Seasonality
 Our revenue varies seasonally depending on a number of factors, including the number of business days in a period. We generate lower revenue and experience lower clinician utilization in periods that have fewer business days than other periods. This trend makes it difficult to forecast our future results with precision and to assess accurately whether increases or decreases in any one or more quarters are likely to cause annual results to exceed or fall short of previously issued guidance. Unanticipated future volatility can cause actual results to vary significantly from our guidance, even where that guidance reflects a range of possible results and has been updated to take account of partial-year results.

Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry
 We may not grow at the rates we historically have achieved or at all, even if our key metrics may imply future growth, including if we are unable to successfully execute on our growth initiatives and business strategies.
 We have experienced significant growth since our inception in 2017. We continually execute a number of growth initiatives, strategies and operating plans designed to enhance our business. For example, our strategy includes recruiting new clinicians, growing our business by opening de novo centers, building our relationships with payors and developing strategic relationships with other primary care and specialist physicians to offer an integrated care model and acquiring strategic high-quality existing centers. The anticipated benefits from these efforts are based on several assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Moreover, we may not be

able to successfully complete these growth initiatives, strategies and operating plans and realize all of the benefits, including growth targets, that we expect to achieve, or it may be more costly to do so than we anticipate.
 Future revenue may not grow at historic rates or may decline. Our future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified clinicians and support personnel, our ability to continue to successfully identify and execute on expansion opportunities, and our ability to demonstrate the value of our platform. A variety of risks could cause us not to realize some or all of these growth plans and benefits. These risks include, among others, labor market dynamics, federal and state antitrust enforcement, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to such growth initiatives, strategies and operating plans, increased difficulty and cost in implementing these efforts, including difficulties in complying with evolving regulatory requirements, and the incurrence of other unexpected costs associated with operating the business. Moreover, our continued implementation of these programs may disrupt our operations and performance. If, for any reason, the benefits we realize are less than our estimates or the implementation of these growth initiatives, strategies and operating plans negatively impacts our operations or costs more or takes longer to effectuate than we expect, or if our assumptions prove inaccurate, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed. We plan to focus our acquisition strategy on larger practices with a minimum clinician count, as well as practices that will result in fewer exceptions to our payor mix, service line adjacencies and operational processes and policies. As a result, we may complete fewer acquisitions and our future growth may not reflect the same trends as our historic growth.
 If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our expenses could increase more than expected, our revenue may not increase proportionally or at all, and we may be unable to execute on our business strategy.
 Our significant growth in recent periods has and may continue to put strain on our business, operations and employees. For example, we added 85 centers through our subsidiaries and affiliated practices in 2022 and grew from 3,097 employed active clinicians as of December 31, 2020 to 4,790 clinicians as of December 31, 2021, and to 5,631 clinicians as of December 31, 2022. We have also significantly increased the number of patient visits conducted over this period. We anticipate that our operations will continue to rapidly expand. To manage our current and anticipated future growth effectively, we must continue to maintain and enhance our financial and accounting systems and our IT infrastructure. For example, as we implement our growth strategy, we will make strategic investments in enterprise-level scalable infrastructure, and in order for our clinicians to effectively provide virtual services to patients, we need to provide them with adequate IT and technology support. If we are unable to align our enterprise-level infrastructure with the needs of our clinicians and staff, then we will not be able to realize the full capacity of our services.
 Failure to effectively manage our growth could also lead us to over-invest or under-invest in development and operations, result in or exacerbate weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems or controls, give rise to operational mistakes, financial losses, loss of productivity or business opportunities and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees. Our growth is expected to require significant capital expenditures. As we expand and make related upfront capital expenditures, including leasing new centers, developing our platform, and hiring clinicians within those centers, our margins may be reduced during those periods as we will not recognize patient service revenue until those centers open and begin patient visits. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenue may not increase or may grow more slowly than expected and we may be unable to implement our business strategy, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 We face competition for experienced clinicians that may increase labor costs and reduce profitability if we are unable to retain clinicians.
 Our ability to retain and attract qualified clinicians is critical to our ability to provide high quality care to patients and successfully cultivate and maintain strong relationships in the communities we serve. If we cannot recruit and retain our base of experienced and qualified clinicians, our expenses may increase and our revenues may decline. While we saw an increase in turnover during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we believe our retention rates have since stabilized and have been at consistent levels over the past year.
 As we implement actions to reduce attrition and increase hiring of clinicians, we have experienced increases in our labor costs, primarily due to higher wages and greater benefits required to retain and attract qualified healthcare personnel, and such increases may adversely affect our profitability. To attract, train and retain qualified clinicians, we offer competitive compensation and benefit packages (including an equity incentive program), which may continue to require significant investment. These measures may not be enough to attract and retain the personnel we require to operate our business effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, while we attempt to manage overall labor costs in the most efficient way, our efforts to manage them may have limited effectiveness and may lead to increased turnover and other challenges.
In addition, hiring new clinicians involves challenges, including the ability to manage decreased profitability and increased expenses incurred during each clinician’s development and ramp-up period. Rising expenses including wage inflation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain high-quality clinicians. The substantial management time and resources that our new clinicians require may result in disruption to our existing business operations, which may harm our profitability. Our inability to successfully address these challenges and other factors may adversely affect the quality and profitability of our business operations as we pursue our growth and human capital strategy.


Our growth depends on our ability to recruit, acquire and retain clinicians.
 Our model requires us to continue to hire clinicians and establish a patient base in order to produce a return on investment. When we enter new markets, we may encounter difficulties in attracting new clinicians due to competition and area demographics and may encounter difficulties in attracting new patients due to a lack of patient familiarity with our brand, our lack of familiarity with local patient preferences, and preexisting relationships between patients and clinicians who are not affiliated with our Company. We cannot be certain that we will produce the anticipated revenues or return on investment or that our performance will not be materially adversely affected by new or expanded competition in our market areas.
 We plan to acquire existing high-quality centers as part of our business strategy and may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management’s attention, result in dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations, and we may have difficulty integrating any such acquisitions successfully or realizing the anticipated benefits therefrom.
 Historically, a part of our business strategy has been the acquisition of existing high-quality centers with in-network payor relationships. We plan to continue to evaluate and make acquisitions pursuant to our strategy and may also seek to acquire or invest in businesses or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business and our platform, enhance our capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.
 We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from acquired centers due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to:
 •unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with acquisitions;
 •difficulty integrating or migrating accounting systems, operations and personnel of acquired businesses;
 •diversion of management’s attention from other business matters;
 •use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and
 •use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate acquisitions.
 Our inability to successfully integrate or realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. If our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our results of operations based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
 We may decide to incur additional debt in connection with an acquisition or issue our common stock or other securities to the equity holders of the acquired business, which would potentially dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders. We cannot predict the number, timing or size of future acquisitions or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating results.
 We operate in a competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.
 The market for mental health care is competitive. We compete in a highly fragmented market with direct and indirect competitors that offer varying levels of impact to key stakeholders such as patients, clinicians, payor partners, and primary care and other specialist physician partners. Our competitive success is contingent on our ability to address the needs of key stakeholders efficiently and with superior outcomes at scale compared with competitors. We compete across various segments within the mental health care market, including with respect to traditional health care providers and medical practices, technology platforms, care management and coordination, digital health, telehealth and health information exchange. Competition in our market involves changing technologies, evolving regulatory requirements and industry expectations, and changes in clinician and patient needs. If we are unable to keep pace with the evolving needs of our patients and clinicians and the evolving competitive landscape in a timely and efficient manner, demand for our services may be reduced and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.
 Each of the individual geographic areas in which we operate has a different competitive landscape. In each of our markets, we compete with other outpatient mental health providers for patients and in contracting with commercial payors. In addition, we face intense competition from other clinical practices, hospitals, health systems and other outpatient mental health providers in recruiting psychiatrists, APNs, psychologists, therapists, and other health care professionals. The inability to attract new clinicians would negatively affect our financial results.
 Our competitors primarily include other outpatient mental health providers that deliver care in-person or through virtual visits. Our indirect competitors also include episodic consumer-driven point solutions, such as in-person and virtual life coaching, digital therapy and support tools and other technologies related to mental health care services. In addition to established mental health providers, we may face additional competition from new market entrants, including major retailers that have recently begun to offer

in-person and virtual mental health care in certain markets. Generally, practices, certain hospitals, and other outpatient mental health providers in the local communities we serve provide services similar to those we offer, and, in some cases, our competitors may offer a broader array of services, more flexible hours or more desirable locations to patients and outpatient mental health providers than ours, and may have larger or more specialized medical staffs to serve patients. Furthermore, health care consumers are now able to access patient satisfaction data, as well as standard charges for services, to compare competing outpatient mental health providers; if any of our centers or our affiliated practices achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors’) on patient satisfaction surveys, or if our standard charges are or are perceived to be higher than our competitors, we may attract fewer patients. Additional quality measures and trends toward clinical or billing transparency, including recently enacted price transparency rules that would require third-party payors to make their pricing information publicly available, may have a negative impact on our competitive position and patient volumes, as patients may prefer to use lower-cost health care providers if they deliver services that are perceived to be similar in quality to ours. Competition from specialized providers, medical practices, retailers, digital health companies and other parties could negatively impact our revenue and market share.
 We may encounter competitors that have greater name recognition, longer operating histories or more resources than us. Further, our current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or patient or clinician requirements and may have the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition. In light of these factors, even if our model is more effective than those of our competitors, current or potential patients or clinicians may choose to turn to our competitors. If we are unable to successfully compete in the mental healthcare market, our business and prospects would be materially harmed.
 Even if the markets in which we compete achieve our forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.
 Market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. In particular, the size and growth of the overall U.S. mental healthcare market is subject to significant variables, including a changing regulatory environment and population demographics, which can be difficult to measure, estimate or quantify. Estimating and forecasting growth opportunities in any given market are difficult and affected by multiple variables such as population growth, concentration of prospective patients and population density, among other things. Further, we may not be able to sufficiently penetrate certain market segments included in our estimates and forecasts, including due to limited deployable capital, ineffective marketing efforts or the inability to develop sufficient presence in a given market to attract patients or contract with payors or primary care and other specialist physician partners in that market. In addition, increased unemployment may lead to a loss of insurance benefits for patients, negatively impacting their ability to access our services and, in turn, our financial performance. For these reasons, estimates and forecasts relating to the size and expected growth of our target markets may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets in which we compete meet our size estimates and forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.
If reimbursement rates paid by third-party payors are reduced or if third-party payors otherwise restrain our ability to obtain or deliver care to patients, our business could be harmed.
 Private third-party payors pay for the services that we provide to many of our patients. During the year ended December 31, 2022, 96% of our patients were insured as of their latest visit. If any commercial third-party payors reduce their reimbursement rates or elect not to cover some or all of our services, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed. Third-party payors may also elect to create narrow networks, which may exclude our clinicians. A majority of our payor relationships operate across multiple independent regional contracts. Changes in reimbursement rates from these or other large commercial payors could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
 Two payors individually exceeded 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022: UnitedHealthcare and Anthem, comprising 19% and 14% of our total revenue, respectively. Therefore, changes in the reimbursement rates or coverage offered by these payors may adversely impact our business and results of operations more than changes implemented by other payors. We plan to be selective with our payor strategy. If we choose to structure our reimbursement coverage through larger payors, these payors may determine the reimbursement rates and coverage for more of our patients.
 Our commercial payor contracts are typically structured as fee-for-service arrangements, pursuant to which we, or our affiliated practices, collect the fees for patient services. Under these arrangements, we assume financial risks related to changes in the mix of insured and uninsured patients and patients covered by government-sponsored health care programs, third-party reimbursement rates and patient volume.
 A portion of our revenue comes from government health care programs. Payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review and federal and state funding restrictions, each of which could increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing services to patients and the timing of payments. We are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations. These rates are also generally adjusted annually for inflation. However, those adjustments may not reflect actual increases of the cost of providing health care services. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of, among other things, deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding requirements from

federal healthcare reform legislation, may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs. Changes in government health care programs may reduce or delay the reimbursement we receive from them or private payors and could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
 A substantial decrease in patient volume, an increase in the number of uninsured or underinsured patients or an increase in the number of patients covered by government health care programs, as opposed to commercial plans that have higher reimbursement levels, could reduce our profitability and adversely impact future growth. In addition, we may be unable to enter new payor contracts on favorable terms, or at all. In some cases, our revenue decreases if our volume or reimbursement decreases, but our expenses, including clinician compensation, may not decrease proportionately.
 There is also a trend in the healthcare sector of payors shifting to new payment models and value-based care arrangements. Changing legislation and other regulatory and executive developments have led to the creation of new models of care and other initiatives in both the government and private sector. Value-based care incentivizes health care providers to improve both the health and well-being of their patients while concurrently managing the medical expenses or “spend” related to a particular population. Value-based care reimbursement models implemented by government health care programs or private third-party payors could materially change the manner in which mental health providers are reimbursed. Any failure on our part to adequately implement strategic initiatives to adjust to these marketplace developments could have a material adverse impact on our business.
 A nominal number of our current contracts provide for incremental payments tied to the attainment of quality or performance metrics. If we fail to obtain these metrics in future periods, our revenue may decrease relative to past periods. In addition, we may enter into contracts in the future that may include parallel or full risk sharing for identified populations. These agreements would expose us to significant financial downside in the event that we are not able to improve outcomes and reduce total cost of care for the populations. These contracts may include components of medical spending, increasing the size of potential downside risk relative to traditional fee-for-service mental health spending.
 The federal government and several states have enacted laws restricting the amount out-of-network providers of services can charge and recover for such services.
 In December 2020, in connection with the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, the No Surprises Act introduced national limitations on physician billing for certain services furnished by providers who are not in-network with the patient’s self-insured health plan, individual or group health plan (including fully-insured plans) that became effective on January 1, 2022. In addition, several states where we conduct business have enacted or are considering similar laws that would apply to patients having state-regulated insurance. For example, Florida, Ohio and Texas have adopted their own balance billing laws that, in certain cases, prohibit out-of-network providers from billing patients in excess of in-network rates. These measures could limit the amount we can charge and recover for services we furnish where we have not contracted with the patient’s insurer, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, these measures could affect our ability to contract with certain payors and under historically similar terms and may cause, and the prospect of these changes may cause, payors to terminate their contracts with us and our affiliated practices, further affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There is also risk that additional legislation at the federal and state level will give rise to major third-party payors leveraging this legislation or related changes as an opportunity to terminate and renegotiate existing reimbursement rates.
 Financial pressures on patients, as well as economic conditions, may adversely affect our patient volume.
 We may be adversely affected by patients’ unwillingness to pay for treatment by our clinicians. Higher numbers of unemployed individuals generally translate into more individuals without health care insurance to help pay for services, thereby increasing the potential for persons to elect not to seek treatment if they cannot afford to self-pay. Growth of patient receivables or deterioration in the ability to collect on these accounts, due to changes in economic conditions or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, patients with high deductible insurance plans may be less likely to seek treatment as a result of higher expected out-of-pocket costs.
 We may receive reimbursement for virtual services that is less than for comparable in-person services, which would negatively impact revenue and results of operations.
 From time to time, we may operate in states that have not adopted laws related to parity between reimbursement rates for virtual services and in-person care. If we are not able to enter into regional payor contracts that provide for reimbursement parity between in-person and virtual services, private payors may not reimburse for virtual services at the same rates as in-person care for all patients within that market. Currently, our reimbursement rates for virtual services and in-person care are substantially similar. This is driven by contractual arrangements with our payor partners or payor policies. If we are not able to enter into or renew payor contracts on these terms or if payor policies change, we may receive reimbursement for virtual services that is less than comparable to in-person services in such states, which would negatively impact our revenue with respect to such markets, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations.


Failure to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a negative impact on our patient service revenue, bad debt expense and cash flow.
 Billing for our services is complex. The practice of providing mental health services in advance of payment or prior to assessing a patient’s ability to pay for such services may have a significant negative impact on our patient service revenue, bad debt expense and cash flow. We bill numerous and varied payors, including self-pay patients and various forms of commercial insurance providers. Different payors typically have differing forms of billing requirements that must be met prior to receiving payment for services rendered. Self-pay patients and third-party payors may fail to pay for services even if they have been properly billed. Reimbursement to us is typically conditioned on, among other things, our providing the proper procedure and diagnosis codes. Incorrect or incomplete documentation and billing information could result in non-payment for services rendered or reduction in reimbursement. Additional factors that could complicate our billing include variation in coverage for similar services among various payors and the difficulty of adherence to specific compliance requirements, coding and various other procedures mandated by responsible parties. To the extent the complexity associated with billing for our services causes delays in our cash collections, we assume the financial risk of increased carrying costs associated with the aging of our accounts receivable as well as the increased potential for bad debt expense.
 We face inspections, reviews, audits and investigations under our commercial payor contracts and pursuant to federal and state programs. These audits could have adverse findings that may negatively affect our business, including our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and reputation.
 We are subject to various inspections, reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and any payor-specific requirements. Commercial payors and government programs reserve the right to conduct audits. We also periodically conduct internal audits and reviews of our regulatory compliance. An adverse inspection, review, audit or investigation could result in:
 •refunding amounts we have been paid from payors;
 •state or federal agencies imposing fines, penalties and other sanctions on us;
 •temporary suspension of payment for new patients to the practice;
 •decertification or exclusion from participation in one or more payor networks;
 •self-disclosure of violations to applicable regulatory authorities;
 •damage to our reputation;
 •the revocation of a clinician’s or a practice’s license; and
 •loss of certain rights under, or termination of, our contracts with commercial payors.
 We have in the past and may in the future be required to refund amounts we have been paid and/or pay fines and penalties as a result of these inspections, reviews, audits and investigations. If adverse inspections, reviews, audits or investigations occur and any of the results noted above occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the legal, document production and other costs associated with complying with these inspections, reviews, audits or investigations could be significant.
 We are dependent on credentialing our clinicians under our insurance contracts at the time of hire.
 We are responsible for credentialing our existing and new clinicians, and all of our clinicians need to be credentialed, either by us or by a contracted third party. The amount of time and expense required to complete credentialing varies substantially between payor and region and is largely out of our control. Any delay in completing credentialing will result in a delay in clinicians seeing patients and a concomitant delay in generating revenue, which may materially affect our business. We may not be able to delegate credentialing for new centers that we may acquire in the future, which could result in delays in entry to new markets. Any failure of our clinicians to maintain credentials and licenses could result in delays in our ability to deliver care to patients, and therefore adversely affect our reputation and our business. If we are required to cover expenses related to new clinician credentialing in amounts greater than we anticipate, our forecasts for our financial condition and results of operations may not align with management's expectations.
 Our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems.
 Our business is dependent on maintaining effective information systems as well as the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our patients, support our clinicians and payor partners and operate our business. Because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage, it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our partners regard as significant. If our data were found to be inaccurate or unreliable due to fraud or other error, or if we, or any of the third-party vendors we engage, were to fail to maintain information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience operational disruptions that may impact our patients and

clinicians and hinder our ability to provide care to patients, retain and attract patients, establish reserves, report financial results timely and accurately and maintain regulatory compliance, among other things. Furthermore, when we implement new systems and/or upgrade existing systems, we could be faced with temporary or prolonged disruptions that could adversely affect our business or expose us to increased risk of cybersecurity breaches and failures.
 Our information technology strategy and execution are critical to our continued success. We must continue to invest in long-term solutions that will enable us to anticipate patient needs and expectations, enhance the patient experience, act as a differentiator in the market, protect against rapidly changing cybersecurity risks and threats, and keep pace with evolving privacy and security laws, requirements and regulations, including changes in payment regimes such as the PCI DSS. Our success is dependent, in large part, on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and continuing to deliver and enhance technology systems that support our business processes in a cost-efficient and resource-efficient manner. We have identified certain weaknesses with respect to our IT function. See “—Risks Related to Our Common Stock—We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation of the material weaknesses is not effective, or we fail to develop and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired, which could harm our business and negatively impact the value of our common stock.”
 Increasing regulatory and legislative changes place additional demands on our information technology infrastructure that could have a direct impact on resources available for other projects tied to our strategic initiatives for our technology platform. In addition, recent trends toward greater patient engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important. We and our third-party vendors must also develop new systems to meet current market standards and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and patient needs. Failure to do so may present compliance challenges and impede our ability to deliver care to patients in a competitive manner. Further, because system development projects are long-term in nature, they may be more costly than expected to complete and may not deliver the expected benefits upon completion. Additional development projects may be needed or arise in the future and we may not have the necessary resources to complete such development projects. Further, the technological advances of our competitors or future competitors may result in our technologies or future technologies become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our failure to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Similarly, if our third party vendors fail to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of their own information technology systems, interruptions in their systems or network may result in disruptions of our own systems and business operations.
 If we cannot license rights to use technologies on reasonable terms, our ability to provide digital services, including virtual visits, and develop our technology platform would be inhibited.
 We license certain rights to use technologies related to our digital services, including virtual visits, patient visit scheduling, patient-clinician matching, and other services, and, in the future, we may identify additional third-party intellectual property that we may need to license in order to engage in our business. However, such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. The licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and several more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater development or commercialization capabilities. In addition, such licenses may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same intellectual property licensed to us. If we are unable to enter into the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all, if any necessary licenses are subsequently terminated, if our licensors fail to abide by the terms of the licenses, if our licensors fail to prevent infringement by third parties, or if the licensed intellectual property rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable, our business could be adversely affected. Moreover, we could encounter delays and other obstacles in our attempt to develop alternatives.
 We lease all of our centers and may experience risks relating to lease termination, lease expense escalators, lease extensions and special charges.
 We currently lease all of our centers. Our leases are typically on terms ranging from one to seven years. Each of our leases provides that the lessor may terminate the lease, subject to applicable cure provisions, for a number of reasons, including failure to pay rent as specified or default of terms of the lease that are not cured within a specified notice period including, but not limited to, abandonment of the space, use of the space of a purpose not permitted under the lease, failure to maintain the premises in good condition, or creation and maintenance of a nuisance. If a lease agreement is terminated, we may not be able to enter into a new lease agreement on similar or better terms or at all.
 Our lease obligations often include annual fixed rent escalators ranging between 2% and 3% or variable rent escalators based on a consumer price index. These escalators could impact our ability to satisfy certain obligations and financial covenants and place an additional burden on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, particularly if such escalator rates outpace growth in our operating results.


As we continue to expand and have leases with different start dates, it is likely that some number of our leases will expire each year. Our lease or license agreements often provide for renewal or extension options. These rights may not be exercised in the future or we may not be able to satisfy the conditions precedent to exercising any such renewal or extension. If we are not able to renew or extend our leases at or prior to the end of the existing lease terms, or if the terms of such options are unfavorable or unacceptable to us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
 Leasing centers pursuant to binding lease agreements may limit our ability to exit markets. For instance, if a center subject to a lease becomes unprofitable, we may be required to continue operating such center or, if allowed by the landlord, to close such center, we may remain obligated for the lease payments on such center. We could incur special charges relating to the closing of such center, including lease termination costs or impairment charges, which would reduce our profits and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Upon an event of default, remedies available to our landlords generally include, without limitation, terminating such lease agreement, repossessing and reletting the leased properties and requiring us to remain liable for all obligations under such lease agreement, including the difference between the rent under such lease agreement and the rent payable as a result of reletting the leased properties, or requiring us to pay the net present value of the rent due for the balance of the term of such lease agreement. The exercise of such remedies could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
 We depend on our executive team, and the loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could harm our business.
 Our success depends largely upon the continued service of our key executive officers. These executive officers are at-will employees and therefore they may terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice. We also do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. In September 2022, we announced the transition of our Chief Executive Officer and in November 2022, we announced the transition of our Chief Financial Officer. Any transition or loss of the services of any of our executives or highly skilled technical and managerial personnel could have a disruptive impact on our ability to implement our business strategy. In addition, these transitions or departures could cause us to incur increased operating expenses, divert management resources and attention, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, internal controls, financial condition or results of operations. Management transition inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and operation execution during this phase. If we have additional changes to our executives, we may be unable to successfully manage and grow our business, and our results of operations, execution of corporate goals, internal controls and financial condition could suffer as a result. Our business would be harmed if we fail to adequately plan for succession of our executives or if we fail to effectively recruit, integrate, retain and develop key talent and/or align our talent with our business needs.
 Litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including in connection with commercial disputes or employment claims, against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.
 We are subject, and in the future may become subject from time to time, to legal proceedings, claims and inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business such as claims brought by our partners in connection with commercial disputes, consumer class action claims, employment claims made by our current or former employees or other claims or proceedings. For example, in August 2022, a shareholder class action lawsuit captioned Nayani v. LifeStance Health Group, Inc., et al. was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against us and certain executives and board members, as well as the underwriters of our initial public offering. The lawsuit alleges, in part, that the defendants violated Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and purports to represent all shareholders who purchased the Company's common stock pursuant to the IPO registration statement.
 Litigation may result in substantial costs, settlement and judgments and may divert management’s attention and resources, which may substantially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance may not cover such claims, may not provide sufficient payments to cover all of the costs to resolve one or more such claims and may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, which could reduce the market price of our common stock.
 Natural or man-made disasters and other similar events, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may significantly disrupt our business and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Our centers may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, power outages, fires, floods, nuclear disasters and acts of terrorism or other criminal activities, which make it difficult or impossible for us to operate our business for some period of time. Although we deliver care in both in-person and digital settings, such disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business and results of operations and harm our reputation. Although we maintain an insurance policy covering damage to property we lease, such insurance may not be sufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Any such losses or damages could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our physician partners’ facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable by such natural or man-made disasters, which may cause disruptions, difficulties or other negative effects on our business and operations, with respect to our integrated care model.


The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus and the introduction of new variants, has impacted, and may continue to impact, our business.
 This pandemic, as well as intensified measures undertaken to contain the spread of COVID-19, could cause disruptions and severely impact our business, including, but not limited to:
 •financial pressures on our patients;
 •negatively impacting collections of accounts receivable;
 •negatively impacting our ability to provide services to patients due to unpredictable demand;
 •negatively impacting our ability to forecast our business’s financial outlook;
 •potential adverse impacts to capital markets, which could impede our liquidity;
 •creating regulatory uncertainty if certain regulations are adopted that are adverse to the business;
 •harming our business, results of operations and financial condition; and
 •loss of insurance coverage.
 We cannot predict with any certainty whether and to what degree the disruption caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and reactions thereto will continue, and we expect to face difficulty accurately predicting our internal financial forecasts. The pandemic also presents challenges to our workforce, including both clinicians and support personnel. As a result of these challenges, we have experienced labor force dynamics which impact our ability to retain clinicians.
 It is not possible for us to accurately determine the extent to which COVID-19 impacted our patient visits and related revenues in 2022, and if these impacts, if any, will continue. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks identified elsewhere in this Annual Report.
 In addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our business and operations are exposed to risks from severe cold and flu season or the occurrence of epidemic or any other widespread illnesses. Our revenues are dependent on patients being physically fit to receive care, in-person or virtually, with our health care providers. As such, patient volume could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season, an epidemic or any other widespread illness. Such a decrease could materially impact our business, operating results, and liquidity.
 We, our clinicians and affiliated practices may become subject to medical liability claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses and may require us to pay significant damages if not covered by insurance.
 Our business entails the risk of medical liability claims against us, our clinicians and our affiliated practices. Although we, our clinicians and our affiliated practices carry insurance covering medical malpractice claims in amounts that we believe are appropriate in light of the risks attendant to our business, successful medical liability claims could result in substantial damage awards that exceed the limits of our and our clinicians’ insurance coverage. Our affiliated practices and clinicians carry professional liability insurance, and we separately carry a professional liability insurance policy, which covers medical malpractice claims. In addition, professional liability insurance is expensive and insurance premiums may increase significantly in the future, particularly as we expand our services. As a result, adequate professional liability insurance may not be available to our clinicians, our affiliated practices or to us in the future at acceptable costs or at all.
 Any claims made against us that are not fully covered by insurance could be costly to defend against, result in substantial damage awards against us and divert the attention of our management and our affiliated medical group from our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any claims may adversely affect our business or reputation.
 If we fail to cost-effectively develop widespread brand awareness and maintain our reputation, or if we fail to achieve and maintain market acceptance for our mental health services, our business could suffer.
 We believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand and maintaining our reputation for delivering high-quality care to patients is important to attract new patients and clinicians and maintain existing patients and clinicians. In addition, we have a growing number of strategic relationships with primary care and other specialist physician partners to develop our integrated care model and referral networks. Market acceptance of our services and patient acquisition depends on educating people, as well as payors and partners, as to the distinct features, ease-of-use, positive lifestyle impact, efficacy, quality and other perceived benefits of our platform as compared to alternatives. In particular, market acceptance is dependent on our ability to sufficiently saturate a particular geographic area to deliver care to local patients. The level of saturation required depends on the needs of the local market and the preferences of the patients in that market. Further, we rely on referrals and placed advertisements to spread brand awareness. Referrals are dependent on patients relaying positive experiences with our services and clinicians. If we are not successful in demonstrating to existing and potential patients, clinicians and payors the benefits of our platform, if we are not able to sufficiently saturate a market in convenient locations for patients, or if we are not able to achieve the support of payors and physician partners for

our model and services, we could experience lower than expected patient retention. Further, the loss or dissatisfaction of patients or clinicians may substantially harm our brand and reputation, inhibit widespread adoption of our services, reduce our revenue, and impair our ability to attract or retain patients and clinicians.
 Our brand promotion activities may not generate awareness or increase revenue and, even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract or retain patients, clinicians, payors and physician partners necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts or to achieve the widespread brand awareness we seek.
 If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our competitive position may be harmed.
 The registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names that we own may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic, lapsed or determined to be infringing on or dilutive of other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights in these trademarks and trade names, which we need in order to build name recognition with potential patients and clinicians. In addition, third parties have filed, and may in the future file, for registration of trademarks similar or identical to our trademarks, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. If they succeed in registering or developing common law rights in such trademarks, and if we are not successful in challenging such third-party rights, we may not be able to use these trademarks to develop brand recognition of our technology platform or other services. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. If we are unable to establish or protect our trademarks and trade names, or if we are unable to build name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively, which could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock.
 Our quarterly results of operations have varied and may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, our quarterly results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, without limitation, the following:
 •the addition or loss of contracts with, or modification of contract terms with, payors, including the reduction of reimbursement rates for our services or the termination of our network contracts with payors;
 •fluctuations in unemployment rates and economic conditions, which could result in reductions in patient visits;
 •the timing of recognition of revenue;
 •the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure, including upfront capital expenditures and other costs related to expanding in existing markets or entering new markets, as well as providing administrative and operations support services to our affiliated practices under our management contracts;
 •our ability to effectively manage the size and composition of our clinician base relative to the level of demand for services from our patients;
 •the timing and success of introductions of new applications and services by us or our competitors;
 •changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors;
 •the timing of expenses related to acquisition or other expansion opportunities and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired practices; and
 •the number of business days in the quarter.
 Our failure to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to execute our growth strategy in the future could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations.
 We may need to raise additional funds, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all. If we raise additional equity financing, our security holders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests. If we engage in additional debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. In addition, the covenants in the Credit Agreement among LifeStance Health Holdings, Inc., Lynnwood Intermediate Holdings, Inc., Capital One, National Association, and each lender party thereto, dated May 4, 2022 (the “2022 Credit Agreement”), may limit our ability to obtain additional debt, and any failure to adhere to these covenants could result in penalties or defaults that could further restrict our liquidity

or limit our ability to obtain financing. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to, among other things:
 •continue to expand our organization;
 •hire, train and retain clinicians and other employees;
 •respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements; or
 •pursue acquisition opportunities.
 As a result, failure to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to execute our growth strategy in the future could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations.
 Risks Related to Healthcare and Data Privacy Regulation
 We conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations, we could incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations or experience adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 The U.S. healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal and state governments. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the manner in which we provide and bill for services and collect reimbursement from governmental programs and private payors, our contractual relationships with affiliated clinicians, vendors and patients, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Of particular importance are:
 •the federal Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, that, unless one of the statutory or regulatory exceptions apply, prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for the provision of certain “designated health services” if the physician or a member of such physician’s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship (including an ownership interest or a compensation arrangement) with the entity, and prohibit the entity from billing Medicare or Medicaid for such designated health services. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $27,750 per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal health care programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the False Claims Act. The statute also provides for a penalty of up to $185,009 for a circumvention scheme;
 •the federal Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate or other remuneration for referring an individual, in return for ordering, leasing, purchasing or recommending or arranging for or to induce the referral of an individual or the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items or services covered, in whole or in part, by any federal health care program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Remuneration has been interpreted broadly to be anything of value, and could include compensation, discounts or free marketing services. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $112,131 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;
 •the criminal health care fraud provisions of HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, and related rules that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any material false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;
 •HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, which also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of PHI;
 •the federal False Claims Act that imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals or entities that knowingly submit false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement in order to have a false claim paid, including qui tam or whistleblower suits;
 •the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the 


beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies;
 •reassignment of payment rules that prohibit certain types of billing and collection practices in connection with claims payable by the Medicare or Medicaid programs;
 •similar state law provisions pertaining to Anti-Kickback, self-referral and false claims issues, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers or services paid out-of-pocket by patients;
 •state laws that prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians’ medical decisions or engaging in some practices such as splitting fees with physicians and psychologists;
 •the Federal Trade Commission Act and federal and state antitrust, consumer protection, advertisement and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that could potentially harm consumers;
 •laws that regulate debt collection practices as applied to our debt collection practices;
 •a provision of the Social Security Act that imposes criminal penalties on health care providers who fail to disclose or refund known overpayments;
 •federal and state laws that prohibit providers from billing and receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid for services unless the services are medically necessary, adequately and accurately documented, and billed using codes that accurately reflect the type and level of services rendered;
 •risks related to employing or contracting with individuals or entities that are sanctioned or excluded from participation in government health care programs;
 •federal and state laws and policies related to the prescribing and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances;
 •the Federal Substance Abuse Confidentiality Regulations known as 42 C.F.R. Part 2;
 •the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, the No Surprises Act;
 •federal and state laws and policies that require health care providers to maintain licensure, certification or accreditation to provide physician and other professional services, to enroll and participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, to report certain changes in their operations to the agencies that administer these programs, as well as state insurance laws; and
 •state and federal statutes and regulations that govern workplace health and safety.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the need to fit certain activities within one of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. Failure to comply with these laws and other laws can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, overpayment recoupment, loss of enrollment status and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are sometimes open to a variety of interpretations. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our business or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us and negatively affect our business. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business and result in adverse publicity.
 To enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice and the OIG have continued their scrutiny of health care providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert management’s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, because of the potential for large monetary exposure under the federal False Claims Act, which provides for treble damages and mandatory minimum penalties of $12,537 to $25,076 per false claim or statement, health care providers often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages that may be awarded in litigation proceedings. Such settlements often contain additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree, settlement agreement or corporate integrity agreement. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating health care providers’ compliance with the health care reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws.
 We are, and may in the future be, a party to various lawsuits, demands, claims, qui tam suits, governmental investigations and audits (including investigations or other actions resulting from our obligation to self-report suspected violations of law) and other legal

matters, any of which could result in, among other things, substantial financial penalties or awards against us, mandated refunds, substantial payments made by us, required changes to our business practices, exclusion from future participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other health care programs and possible criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and materially harm our reputation.
 The laws, regulations and standards governing the provision of health care services may change significantly in the future. We cannot assure you that any new or changed health care laws, regulations or standards will not materially adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that a review of our business by judicial, law enforcement, regulatory or accreditation authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations.
 Regulations related to health care are evolving. To the extent regulations revert to their pre-COVID-19 state, particularly with respect to state licensure laws, our ability to provide virtual service across regions will be hampered.
 In a regulatory climate that is uncertain, our operations may be subject to direct and indirect adoption, expansion or reinterpretation of various laws and regulations. Compliance with these future laws and regulations may require us to change our practices at an undeterminable and possibly significant initial monetary and recurring expense. These additional monetary expenditures may increase future overhead, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to provide virtual services in certain jurisdictions. Areas of government regulation that, if changed, could be costly to us include: rules governing the practice of medicine by physicians; laws relating to licensure requirements for psychiatrists and other licensed mental health professionals; laws limiting the corporate practice of medicine and professional fee-splitting; laws governing the issuance of prescriptions in an online setting; federal and state antitrust laws that affect health care providers; cybersecurity and privacy laws; and laws and rules relating to the distinction between independent contractors and employees. Additionally, the federal public health emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic may expire in May 2023, and as a result, regulatory changes and flexibilities granted on the basis of the public health emergency may be eliminated.
 In addition, a few states have imposed different, and, in some cases, additional, standards regarding the provision of services virtually. The unpredictability of this regulatory landscape means that sudden changes in policy regarding standards of care and reimbursement are possible. If a successful legal challenge or an adverse change in the relevant laws were to occur, and we were unable to adapt our business model accordingly, our operations in the affected jurisdictions would be disrupted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are required to adapt our business model, we may be limited to only in-person services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Several states in which we operate have adopted competition and health care planning laws that affect transactions in the health care industry. Some states require notification, filings, and/or approvals by state agencies with respect to proposed transactions involving health care providers. Such processes can take significant time, require filing fees, result in conditions that require certain operational changes and include regular annual reviews regarding the cost and quality of services, among other topics. These laws and the level of enforcement by the respective state agencies are subject to continuous change and interpretation, and compliance with these laws could adversely affect our business.
 We are dependent on our relationships with affiliated practices, which we do not own, to provide health care services, and our business would be harmed if those relationships were disrupted or if our arrangements with these entities became subject to legal challenges.
 The corporate practice of medicine prohibition exists in some form, by statute, regulation, board of medicine or attorney general guidance, or case law, in certain of the states in which we operate. These laws generally prohibit the practice of medicine or practice of psychology by lay-persons or entities and are intended to prevent unlicensed persons or entities from interfering with or inappropriately influencing providers’ professional judgment. Due to the prevalence of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine, including in certain of the states where we conduct our business, we enter into management services contracts with our affiliated practices to provide a wide range of administrative and operations support services to these practices. Under the management contracts between LifeStance and each affiliated practice, we provide various administrative and management services in exchange for management fees set forth in our management services contracts. To the extent our ability to receive cash fees from the affiliated practices is limited, our ability to use that cash for growth, debt service or other uses may be impaired and, as a result, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, the affiliated practices are owned by our Chief Medical Officer and other licensed clinical leadership employees. In the event of any such employee’s death or disability or upon certain other triggering events, we maintain the right to direct the transfer of the ownership of the affiliated practices to another licensed physician.
 Our ability to perform medical and virtual services in a particular U.S. state is directly dependent upon the applicable laws governing the practice of medicine or other professions, health care delivery and fee splitting in such locations, which are subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. The extent to which a U.S. state considers particular actions or relationships to constitute the practice of medicine or other professions is subject to change and to evolving interpretations by professional boards and state attorneys general, among others, each of which has broad discretion. There is a risk that U.S. state authorities in some jurisdictions may find that our contractual relationships with outpatient mental health practices, which govern the provision of medical and virtual services and the payment of administrative and operations support fees, violate laws prohibiting the corporate practice of

medicine or other professions and fee-splitting. The extent to which each state may consider particular actions or contractual relationships to constitute improper influence of professional judgment varies across the states and is subject to change and to evolving interpretations by state licensing boards and state attorneys general, among others. Accordingly, we must monitor our compliance with laws in every jurisdiction in which we operate on an ongoing basis. Our activities and arrangements, if challenged, could be found to be in violation with the law. Additionally, it is possible that the laws and rules governing the practice of medicine or other professions, including the provision of virtual services, and fee splitting in one or more jurisdictions may change in a manner adverse to our business. While the management contracts prohibit us from controlling, influencing or otherwise interfering with the practice of medicine and other professions by the affiliated clinicians, and provide that clinicians retain exclusive control and responsibility for all aspects of the practice of medicine or other professions and the delivery of clinical services, there can be no assurance that our contractual arrangements and activities with affiliated practices will be free from scrutiny from U.S. state authorities, and we cannot guarantee that subsequent interpretation of the corporate practice and fee-splitting laws will not circumscribe our business operations. State corporate practice doctrines also often impose penalties on health care clinicians themselves for aiding the corporate practice of medicine or other professions, which could discourage clinicians from participating in our network. If a successful legal challenge or an adverse change in relevant laws were to occur, and we were unable to adapt our business model accordingly, our operations in affected jurisdictions would be disrupted, which could harm our business.
 While we expect that our relationships with our affiliated practices will continue, a material change in our relationship with these entities, or among the affiliated practices, whether resulting from a dispute among the entities, a challenge from a governmental regulator, a change in government regulation, or the loss of these relationships or contracts with outpatient mental health practices, could impair our ability to provide services to our patients and could harm our business.
 The impact of healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in health care spending on us is currently unknown, but may harm our business.
 Our revenue is dependent on the healthcare industry and could be affected by changes in health care spending, reimbursement and policy. The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “Affordable Care Act” or the “ACA”) in 2010 made major changes in how health care is delivered and reimbursed, and increased access to health insurance benefits to the uninsured and underinsured population of the United States.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA as well as efforts to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. While efforts to repeal all or part of the ACA have subsided, in part due to the results of the 2020 election, we cannot be certain that there will not be further legislative efforts or judicial challenges in the future. In addition to judicial challenges, the Biden administration or U.S. Congress may advance new health care policy goals and objectives through statute, regulation and executive order. For example, the Biden administration has indicated an intent to propose a public health insurance option, which, if enacted, could significantly change the competitive landscape among commercial insurance carriers.
 Other legislative changes to provider reimbursement have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 (known as Medicare sequestration) and subsequent extensions, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension between May 1, 2020 and March 31, 2022. The sequestration reductions will be phased in gradually with a 1% sequestration reduction between April 1 and June 30, 2022; beginning on July 1, 2022, the full 2% sequestration went into effect. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. New laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which may materially adversely affect customer demand and affordability for our business and, accordingly, the results of our financial operations. Additional changes that may affect our business include the expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for physicians under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”). At this time, it is still unclear how the introduction of the MACRA program will impact overall physician reimbursement.
 Such changes in the regulatory environment may also result in changes to our payor mix that may affect our operations and revenue. In addition, certain provisions of the ACA authorize voluntary demonstration projects, which include the development of bundling payments for acute, inpatient hospital services, physician services and post-acute services for episodes of hospital care. Further, the ACA may adversely affect payors by increasing medical costs generally, which could have an effect on the industry and potentially impact our business and revenue as payors seek to offset these increases by reducing costs in other areas. Certain of these provisions are still being implemented and the full impact of these changes on us cannot be determined at this time.
 Uncertainty regarding future amendments to the ACA as well as new legislative proposals to reform health care and government insurance programs, along with the trend toward managed health care in the United States, could result in reduced demand and prices for our services. We expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which

could limit the amounts that federal and state governments and other third-party payors will pay for health care products and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 If our or our vendors’ security measures fail or are breached and unauthorized access to our employees’, patients’ or partners’ data is obtained, our systems may be perceived as insecure, we may incur significant liabilities, including through private litigation or regulatory action, our reputation may be harmed, and we could lose patients and partners.
 Our business involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees and others, as well as the PHI of our patients. Several laws and regulations require us to keep this information secure. Because of the extreme sensitivity of the information we store and transmit, the security features of our and our third-party vendors’ computer, network and communications systems infrastructure are critical to the success of our business. Our security features and processes or our vetting and oversight of third parties may not be sufficient for all circumstances. We also exercise limited control over third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the technology and information services they provide. Determined threat actors would likely be able to penetrate our security or the security of our vendors with enough skills, resources, and time. A breach or failure of our or our third-party vendors’ network, hosted service providers or vendor systems could result from a variety of circumstances and events, including third-party action, employee negligence or error, malfeasance, computer viruses, cyber-attacks by computer hackers such as denial-of-service and phishing attacks, nation-state attacks, political protests, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software and databases, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. We are also dependent on a technology supply chain that involves many third parties, some of whom may not be known to us, and each of these companies may also be a source of potential risk to our patients, operations and reputation. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operating large-scale and complex automated attacks, including on companies within the healthcare industry. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we and our third-party vendors may be unable to anticipate all potential threats. We may be required to expend additional resources to further enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. For example, in December 2021, LifeStance Health became aware of, and investigated a vulnerability, known as Log4j, that impacted systems and services worldwide, including those used by us and our third-party vendors. If our or our third-party vendors’ security measures fail or are breached, it could result in unauthorized persons accessing sensitive patient data (including PHI), a loss of or damage to our data, or an inability to access data sources, process data or provide our services to our patients. A security incident may even remain undetected for an extended period, and we or our third-party vendors may be unable to anticipate such threats and attacks or implement adequate preventive measures. Such failures or breaches of our or our third-party vendors’ security measures, or our or our third-party vendors’ inability to effectively resolve such failures or breaches in a timely manner, could severely damage our reputation, adversely affect patient, provider or investor confidence in us, and reduce the demand for our services from existing and potential patients. In addition, we could face litigation, damages for contract breach, monetary penalties or regulatory actions for violation of applicable laws or regulations, and incur significant costs to comply with applicable data breach notification laws and to implement remedial measures to prevent future occurrences and mitigate past violations. Although we maintain insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and related expenses, we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all liability and in any event, insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident.
 Our Board of Directors is briefed periodically on cybersecurity and risk management issues and we have implemented a number of processes to avoid cyber threats and to protect privacy. However, the processes we have implemented in connection with such initiatives may be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential, proprietary or sensitive data, including personal data. In addition, the competition for talent in the data privacy and cybersecurity space is intense, and we may be unable to hire, develop or retain suitable talent capable of adequately detecting, mitigating or remediating these risks. Our failure to adhere to, or successfully implement processes in response to, evolving cybersecurity threats and changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or damage to our reputation in the marketplace.
 Should an attacker gain access to our network or the network of our third-party vendor, including by way of example, using compromised credentials of an authorized user, we are at risk that the attacker might successfully leverage that access to compromise additional systems and data. Certain measures that could increase the security of our systems, such as data encryption (including data at rest encryption), heightened monitoring and logging, scanning for source code errors or deployment of multi-factor authentication, take significant time and resources to deploy broadly, and such measures may not be deployed in a timely manner or be effective against an attack. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. The inability to implement, maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Our information systems must be continually updated, patched and upgraded to protect against known vulnerabilities. The volume of new vulnerabilities has increased markedly, as has the criticality of patches and other remedial measures. In addition to remediating newly identified vulnerabilities, previously identified vulnerabilities must also be continuously addressed. Accordingly, we are at risk that cyber-attackers exploit these known vulnerabilities before they have been addressed. Due to the systems and platforms that we operate, the increased frequency at which vendors are issuing security patches to their products, the need to test patches and, in some cases, coordinate with clients and vendors, before they can be deployed, we continuously face the substantial risk

that we cannot deploy patches in a timely manner. These risks can be heightened as we acquire and work to integrate additional centers. We are also dependent on third-party vendors to keep their systems patched and secure in order to protect our information systems and data. Any failure related to these activities and any breach of our information systems could result in significant liability and have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and financial condition.
 Our use and disclosure of PII, including PHI, is subject to federal and state privacy and security regulations, and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure such information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm and, in turn, substantial harm to our affiliated practices, affiliated clinicians, patient base and revenue.
 The privacy and security of PII stored, maintained, received or transmitted electronically is a major issue in the United States. While we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, legal standards for privacy, including but not limited to “unfairness” and “deception,” as enforced by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, continue to evolve and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Recently, there has been an increase in public awareness of privacy issues in the wake of revelations about the activities of various government agencies and in the number of private privacy-related lawsuits filed against companies. Any allegations about us, our affiliated practices or our affiliated clinicians with regard to the collection, processing, use, disclosure, or security of PII or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, could damage our reputation and harm our business.
 We also publish statements to our patients and stakeholders that describe how we handle and protect personal information. If federal or state regulatory authorities or private litigants consider any portion of these statements to be untrue or misleading, we may be subject to claims of deceptive practices, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences, including, without limitation, costs of responding to investigations, defending against litigation, settling claims and complying with regulatory or court orders.
 Numerous foreign, federal and state laws and regulations govern collection, dissemination, use and confidentiality of personally identifiable health information, including state privacy and confidentiality laws (including state laws requiring disclosure of breaches) and HIPAA.
 HIPAA establishes a set of basic national privacy and security standards for the protection of PHI, by health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers, referred to as covered entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services, which includes us. Certain of our entities and affiliated practices are covered entities, while our management service entities are business associates.
 HIPAA requires covered entities and business associates to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to PHI that is used or disclosed, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. HIPAA also implemented the use of standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic health care transactions, including activities associated with the billing and collection of health care claims.
 HIPAA imposes mandatory penalties for certain violations. Penalties for violations of HIPAA and its implementing regulations include civil monetary penalties of up to $63,973 per violation, not to exceed $1,919,173 for violations of the same standard in a single calendar year (as of 2022, and subject to periodic adjustments for inflation). However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards, which could result in significant fines. A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 and up to one-year of imprisonment. The criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell, transfer, or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI. Any such penalties or lawsuits could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 In addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities or business associates for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Standards. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator.
 HIPAA further requires that patients be notified of any unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure of their unsecured PHI that compromises the privacy or security of such information, with certain exceptions related to unintentional or inadvertent use or disclosure by employees or authorized individuals. HIPAA specifies that such notifications must be made “without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach.” If a breach affects 500 patients or more, it must be reported to HHS without unreasonable delay, and HHS will post the name of the breaching entity on its public website. Breaches affecting 500 patients or more in the same state or jurisdiction must also be reported to the local media. If a breach involves fewer than 500 people, the covered entity must record it in a log and notify HHS at least annually. We have experienced minor breaches of PHI in

the ordinary course of business, but none have involved more than 500 individuals. Further, the HHS OCR published a proposed rule in January of 2021, which, among other things calls for greater care coordination and an individual’s rights to access patient records. The proposed rule specifically encourages the disclosure of PHI when needed to help individuals experiencing substance use disorder, serious mental illness and in emergency circumstances. The proposed rule is subject to a regulatory suspension announced by the Biden administration and we do not know when (or if) the final rule will be published or whether there may be additional changes to the regulations, but when it is, we will need to evaluate and potentially update our HIPAA regulatory programs and documentation to ensure compliance with such requirements.
 Additionally, we may be required to comply with the Federal Substance Abuse Confidentiality Regulations known as 42 C.F.R. Part 2 ("Part 2"). In July 2020, new regulations overhauled these laws to better align with HIPAA and make other updates to facilitate better coordination of care in response to the opioid epidemic and on December 2, 2022, HHS OCR published a proposed rule containing proposals to implement the CARES Act provisions, which bring Part 2 in alignment with HIPAA including, among other things, expanding the scope of permitted disclosures of substance use disorder treatment records and apply HIPAA's breach notification standards to breaches of records protected by Part 2. The federal government could initiate criminal charges for violations of Part 2, which include $500 for the first offense; and $5,000 for all subsequent offenses and seek fines up to $5,000 per violation for individuals and $10,000 per violation for organizations. Under the CARES Act, Congress also gave HHS the authority to issue civil money penalties for violations of Part 2, ranging from $100 to $50,000 per violation depending on the level of culpability.
 Further, the U.S. federal government and various states and governmental agencies have adopted or are considering adopting various laws, regulations and standards regarding the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of sensitive and personal information. For example, California implemented the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, which imposes restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, particularly if a state affords greater protection to individuals than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective, we have to comply with the stricter provisions. In addition to fines and penalties imposed upon violators, some of these state laws also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. California has also implemented the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), which came into effect on January 1, 2020, which increases privacy rights for California residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information. Among other things, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and provide such consumers new data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. The CCPA has been amended from time to time, and it is possible that further amendments will be enacted, but even in its current format remains unclear how various provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. Additionally, the recently passed California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which will significantly modifies the CCPA, including expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information, and creating a new state agency that will is vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and CPRA. The majority of the CPRA provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, with some requirements applying to data collected beginning January 1, 2022. The CPRA will significantly expand the CCPA's data protection obligations. Failure to comply with CCPA or CPRA could result in penalties for noncompliance of up to $7,500 per violation. We will need to continue to evaluate our privacy program as the implementation of the law evolves and may need to make further modifications to our programs, which, if we fail to do so as required, may expose us to liability under the regulation. When we implement new systems and/or upgrade existing systems used to store PII, we could be exposed to increased risk of data security breaches and failures.
 There are many other state-based data privacy and security laws and regulations that may impact our business. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could restrict the way services involving data are offered, all of which may adversely affect our results of operations. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to sensitive and personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. State laws are changing rapidly and there is discussion in Congress of a new federal data protection and privacy law to which we may be subject.
 The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our clients and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. Further, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as PHI or PII, along with increased customer demands for enhanced data security infrastructure, could greatly increase our cost of providing our services, decrease demand for our services, reduce our revenue and/or subject us to additional liabilities.
 In addition to the applicable federal and state laws, we are also subject to PCI DSS, a self-regulatory standard that requires companies that process payment card data to implement certain data security measures. If we or our payment processor fail to comply with the PCI DSS, we may incur significant fines or liability and lose access to major payment card systems. Our systems are subject to annual review under the PCI DSS requirements, and we have historically had, may now have, and may have in the future have

items that require improvement. Industry groups may in the future adopt additional self-regulatory standards by which we are legally or contractually bound.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of their exceptions and safe harbors, it is possible that our business activities can be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of health care reform. Federal, state and foreign enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between health care companies and health care providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Any such investigations, prosecutions, convictions or settlements could result in significant financial penalties, damage to our brand and reputation, and a loss of customers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.
 Laws regulating scope of clinician practices and supervision requirements may constrain our ability to grow and meet patient needs.
 Each state regulates the scope of practice under our clinicians’ licenses. There is substantial variation across states in scope of practice for many clinician types, including nurse practitioners. In a number of states in which we operate, nurse practitioners are required to have physician supervisors, in particular in connection with the prescription of Schedule II drugs. The need to provide supervisors may constrain our ability to add new clinicians to the practice, meet patient need or serve specific geographic regions. Further, supervision and scope of license laws are subject to frequent change by state legislative bodies. Changes decreasing the scope of license or increasing the onerousness of supervision requirements could adversely affect our ability to meet patient need and ultimately negatively impact our business and results of operations.
 Regulations related to telehealth are still evolving. To the extent regulations revert to their pre-COVID state, our ability to provide or be reimbursed for certain telehealth services could be impaired.
 Given the uncertain regulatory climate, government regulations regarding the provision of telehealth services have been unpredictable, and sudden changes could be costly to us or have a material effect on our business. Further, some states impose strict standards on using telehealth to prescribe certain classes of controlled substances that can be commonly used to treat mental health disorders. The unpredictability of this regulatory landscape means that sudden changes in policy regarding standards of care and reimbursement are possible. If a successful legal challenge or an adverse change in the relevant laws were to occur, and we were unable to adapt our business model accordingly, our operations in the affected jurisdictions would be disrupted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are required to adapt our business model, we may be limited to only in person services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Recent growth in our telehealth services has been facilitated by significant reduction of regulatory and reimbursement barriers for telehealth services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including expansion of reimbursement for telehealth services, and easing of state licensure policies for clinicians, enabling more clinicians to serve patients in more states. During the public health emergency, the Drug Enforcement Agency is permitting providers to prescribe certain control substances through telehealth without requiring those providers to have conducted an in-person medical evaluation. To the extent these regulations revert to their pre-COVID state, our ability to provide certain telehealth services may be impaired, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Risks Related to Indebtedness
 Our existing indebtedness could adversely affect our business and growth prospects.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had $234.0 million in principal amount outstanding under our 2022 Credit Agreement. Our indebtedness, or any additional indebtedness we may incur, could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes for debt service and impair our liquidity position. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we will be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us or at all.
 Our indebtedness and the cash flow needed to satisfy our debt have important consequences, including:
 •limiting funds otherwise available for financing our capital expenditures by requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt;
 •making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates; and
 •making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business.
 Our level of indebtedness may place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged. Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs. Increases in interest rates may directly impact the amount of interest we are required to pay and reduce earnings accordingly. In addition, developments in tax policy, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for interest paid on outstanding indebtedness, could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and our business, financial conditions and results of operations.


In addition, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
 We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such indebtedness, which may not be successful.
 Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance outstanding debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions and by financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in penalties or defaults, which would also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.
 If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service obligations. If we cannot meet our debt service obligations, the holders of our indebtedness may accelerate such indebtedness and, to the extent such indebtedness is secured, foreclose on our assets. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our indebtedness.
 The terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.
 The 2022 Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, including restrictions on our ability to:
 •incur additional indebtedness or other contingent obligations;
 •create liens;
 •make investments, acquisitions, loans and advances;
 •consolidate, merge, liquidate or dissolve;
 •sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of our assets;
 •pay dividends on our equity interests or make other payments in respect of capital stock; and
 •materially alter the business we conduct.
 You should read the discussion under the heading “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information about these covenants.
 The restrictive covenants in the 2022 Credit Agreement require us to satisfy certain financial condition tests. Our ability to satisfy those tests can be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the 2022 Credit Agreement contains a financial maintenance covenant requiring compliance with a maximum leverage ratio as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.
 A breach of the covenants or restrictions under the 2022 Credit Agreement could result in an event of default. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt, which may result in the acceleration of any other debt we may incur to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In the event the holders of our indebtedness accelerate the repayment, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms acceptable to us. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:
 •limited in how we conduct our business;
 •unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or 
 •unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.
 These restrictions, along with restrictions that may be contained in agreements evidencing or governing other future indebtedness, may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our growth strategy.


Risks Related to Our Common Stock
 Our Principal Stockholders control us, and their interests may conflict with ours or yours.
 As of December 31, 2022, investment entities affiliated with TPG Inc. ("TPG"), affiliates of Silversmith Capital Partners ("Silversmith"), and affiliates of Summit Partners ("Summit" and together with TPG and Silversmith, our "Principal Stockholders"), collectively, beneficially owned approximately 64.0% of our common stock. The Principal Stockholders together will control the vote of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, which enables them to control the election of the members of the Board of Directors and other corporate decisions. Even when the Principal Stockholders cease to own shares of our stock representing a majority of the total voting power, for so long as the Principal Stockholders continue to own a significant percentage of our stock, the Principal Stockholders will still be able to significantly influence the composition of our Board of Directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval. Accordingly, for such period of time, the Principal Stockholders will have significant influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies, including the appointment and removal of our officers, decisions on whether to raise future capital and amending our charter and bylaws, which govern the rights attached to our common stock. In particular, for so long as the Principal Stockholders continue to own a significant percentage of our stock, the Principal Stockholders will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of us or a change in the composition of our Board of Directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of us. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of us and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock.
 The Principal Stockholders and their affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities, including investments in the healthcare industry generally. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Principal Stockholders and their affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our other stockholders, such as investing in or advising businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of the Principal Stockholders, any of their affiliates or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and officer capacities) or its affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. The Principal Stockholders also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, each of the Principal Stockholders may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you.
 We are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of Nasdaq and, as a result, we qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You will not have the same protections as those afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such governance requirements.
 The Principal Stockholders together control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:
 •the requirement that a majority of our Board of Directors consist of independent directors;
 •the requirement that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities;
 •the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and
 •the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.
 We may elect to utilize one or more of these exemptions. Accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq.
 We are an emerging growth company and our compliance with the reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Acts of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and may also take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and obtaining stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, the information we provide stockholders is different than the information that is available with respect to other public companies. If some investors find

our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.
 In addition, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period.
 We have in the past and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.
 As a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq, and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. We expect that we will need to hire additional accounting, finance, and other personnel in connection with our efforts to comply with the requirements of being, a public company, and our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time towards maintaining compliance with these requirements. Our management and other personnel has and will also need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time towards compliance with the additional reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These requirements have and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.
 We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation of the material weaknesses is not effective, or we fail to develop and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired, which could harm our business and negatively impact the value of our common stock.
 In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
We did not design and maintain an effective control environment commensurate with our financial reporting requirements due to an insufficient complement of resources in the accounting/finance and IT functions, with an appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training. This material weakness contributed to the following additional material weaknesses:
 •We did not maintain formal accounting policies and procedures, and did not design and maintain controls related to significant accounts and disclosures to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including controls over account reconciliations, segregation of duties and the preparation and review of journal entries. 
 These material weaknesses resulted in material misstatements related to the identification and valuation of intangible assets acquired in business combinations that impacted the classification of intangible assets and goodwill, related impacts to amortization and income tax expense, and the restatement of our previously issued annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 with respect to such intangibles assets acquired in business combinations. Additionally, these material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of substantially all of the financial statement accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
 •We did not design and maintain effective controls over IT general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Specifically, we did not design and maintain: (i) program change management controls for financial systems to ensure that information technology program and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately; (ii) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and that adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs, and data to appropriate Company personnel; (iii) computer operations controls to ensure that critical batch jobs are monitored and data backups are authorized and monitored; and (iv) testing and approval controls for program development to ensure that new software development is aligned with business and IT requirements.


These IT deficiencies did not result in a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements; however, the deficiencies, when aggregated, could impact maintaining effective segregation of duties, as well as the effectiveness of IT-dependent controls (such as automated controls that address the risk of material misstatement to one or more assertions, along with the IT controls and underlying data that support the effectiveness of system-generated data and reports) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting all financial statement accounts and disclosures that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, we have determined these deficiencies in the aggregate constitute a material weakness.
 We have made progress towards designing and implementing the plan to remediate the material weaknesses and will continue to review, revise, and improve the design and implementation of our internal controls as appropriate. Although we have made enhancements to our control procedures, these material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until our controls are operational for a sufficient period of time, tested, and management concludes that these controls are operating effectively. Failing to develop or maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may result in a misstatement of our financial statements or cause investors to lose confidence in us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner or prevent fraud, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company.
 Although we are required to annually assess our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and disclose changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis, as an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our Annual Report on Form 10-K until the first year we are no longer an “emerging growth company”. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may identify additional material weakness and may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operated.
To comply with the requirements of being a public company, we have undertaken certain actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting staff. We may also need to undertake certain other actions in the future, including the hiring of internal audit staff or additional accounting staff. Testing and maintaining internal controls can divert our management's attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.
 Provisions of our corporate governance documents could make an acquisition of our Company more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our stockholders.
 In addition to beneficial ownership by our Principal Stockholders of a controlling percentage of our common stock, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the Delaware General Corporate Law (the “DGCL”), contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include a classified Board of Directors and the ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval that could be used to dilute a potential acquirer. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors. Because our Board of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace current members of our management team. As a result, you may lose your ability to sell your stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures, and efforts by stockholders to change the direction or management of the Company may be unsuccessful.
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates courts in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, and also provide that the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), each of which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, stockholders, or employees.
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for:
 •any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;
 •any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders;
 •any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws;
 •any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; and


•any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine (each, a “Covered Proceeding”).
 Our certificate of incorporation also provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action against us or any of our directors, officers, employees or agents and arising under the Securities Act. However, Section 22 of the Securities Act provides that federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over lawsuits brought the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. To the extent the exclusive forum provision restricts the courts in which claims arising under the Securities Act may be brought, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision. We note that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. This provision does not apply to claims brought under the Exchange Act.
 Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions. These provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities, which could adversely impact our business.
 Each of our Principal Stockholders and the members of our Board of Directors who are affiliated with them, by the terms of our certificate of incorporation, will not be required to offer us any corporate opportunity of which they become aware and can take any such corporate opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment. We, by the terms of our certificate of incorporation, expressly renounce any interest or expectancy in any such corporate opportunity to the extent permitted under applicable law, even if the opportunity is one that we or our subsidiaries might reasonably have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so. Our certificate of incorporation will not be able to be amended to eliminate our renunciation of any such corporate opportunity arising prior to the date of any such amendment.
 Our Principal Stockholders are in the business of making investments in companies and any of our Principal Stockholders may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects if our Principal Stockholders allocate attractive corporate opportunities to themselves or their affiliates instead of to us.
 Our stock price is volatile, and the value of our common stock may decline.
 The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and may fluctuate or decline substantially as a result of a variety of factors. In addition, securities markets worldwide have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could subject the market price of our shares to wide price fluctuations regardless of our operating performance. Our results of operations and the trading price of our shares may fluctuate in response to various factors, including:
 •actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations and whether our results of operations meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;
 •actual or anticipated changes in securities analysts’ estimates and expectations of our financial performance;
 •announcements of new technology platform capabilities, commercial or payor relationships, acquisitions, or other events by us or our competitors;
 •general market conditions, including volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general and of companies in the mental healthcare industry and the general healthcare in particular;
 •investors’ perceptions of our prospects and the prospects of the businesses in which we participate;
 •sales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors, and significant stockholders;
 •announced departures of any of our key personnel;
 •lawsuits threatened or filed against us or involving our industry, or both;
 •changing legal or regulatory developments in the United States and other countries;
 •any default or anticipated default under agreements governing our indebtedness;
 •effects of public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and


•general economic conditions and trends.
 These and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause our results of operations and the market price and demand for our shares to fluctuate substantially. While we believe that results of operations for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results, fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.
 We do not expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future.
 We do not currently pay dividends and do not currently anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the future. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, which may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, the implications of the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and any other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is, and may be, limited by covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. Therefore, any return on investment in our common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our common stock on the open market, which may not occur.
 If securities or industry analysts publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about our business, our common stock price and trading volume could decline.
 The trading market for our shares is influenced, in part, by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our Company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our share price could decline.
