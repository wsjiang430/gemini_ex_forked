Background
 
The Company was incorporated under the laws of Oklahoma in September 1989 as “ADDvantage Media Group, Inc.”  In December 1999, its name was changed to ADDvantage Technologies Group, Inc.  In 2019, the Company moved its headquarters from Broken Arrow, Oklahoma to the Dallas, Texas area.
 
The Company (through its subsidiaries) i) provides turn-key wireless infrastructure services for wireless carriers, tower companies and equipment manufacturers, and ii) distributes and services a comprehensive line of electronics and hardware for the telecommunications industry.  In addition, we offer our customers decommissioning services for surplus and obsolete equipment, which we in turn process through our recycling program.
 
Fulton Technologies, Inc. (“Fulton”) was purchased on January 4, 2019, which established the Company’s Wireless Infrastructure Services segment.
 
The Company’s Telecommunications segment operates through our subsidiaries, Nave Communications Company (“Nave”) and ADDvantage Triton, LLC (“Triton”).
 
For our telecommunications subsidiaries, we sell new, surplus-new and refurbished equipment that we purchase in the market as a result of telecommunications system upgrades or overstock supplies.  We maintain one of the industry's largest inventories of new and used equipment, which allows us to expedite delivery of mission-critical products to our customers.  We continually evaluate new product offerings in the broader telecommunications industry as technology evolves and upgrade our product offerings to stay current with our customer’s technology platforms.

Operating Segments
 
In the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2019, the Company changed its organizational structure with the acquisition of Fulton and the sale of the Cable TV segment.  As a result of these changes, information that the Company’s management team regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed.  The Company’s current reportable segments are Wireless Infrastructure Services (“Wireless”) and Telecommunications (“Telco”).  The Cable Television (“Cable TV”) segment was sold on June 30, 2019.  Therefore, the Company has classified the Cable TV segment as discontinued operations (see Note 4 – Discontinued Operations).
Products and Services
 
Wireless Segment
 
We provide turn-key wireless infrastructure services for the four major U.S. wireless carriers, communication tower companies, national integrators, and original equipment manufacturers that support these wireless carriers.  These services primarily consist of the installation and upgrade of technology on cell sites and the construction of new small cells for 5G.
 
As part of the Fulton acquisition, we were able to hire and retain the majority of Fulton’s existing employee base.  Fulton now has approximately 100 employees.  Fulton performs equipment installations, upgrades and maintenance services for its customers primarily on communication towers.  Having the proper safety record, training capability and quality oversight is paramount in the industry.  Fulton has prided itself in performing safe, timely and high-quality services.  Demand for tower equipment installation and upgrading services is at an all-time high, and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future as wireless carriers continue to add capacity, expand their networks and upgrade their current technology for high speed connectivity, including 5G.
 
Fulton also supports the installation and support of temporary tower locations.  This niche and growing business includes the erection of temporary towers to allow for the maintenance of permanent locations without causing a degradation of wireless in the area.  In addition, Fulton provides temporary tower solutions for special events that require an increase of coverage and capacity for festivals, concerts and sporting events.  Fulton has an inventory of temporary poles of different sizes and uses a unique installation process for the quick deployment of a tower location with little to no environmental impact.
 
Telco Segment
 
The Telco segment provides quality new and used telecommunication networking equipment, including both central office and customer premise equipment, to its customer base of telecommunications providers, enterprise customers and resellers by utilizing its inventory from a broad range of manufacturers as well as other supply channels.  This segment also offers its customers repair and testing services for telecommunications networking equipment.  In addition, this segment offers its customers decommissioning services for surplus and obsolete equipment, which it in turn processes through its recycling program.
Central Office Equipment – Central office equipment includes optical transport, switching, and data center equipment on a customer’s communication network.  Optical equipment products aggregate and transport internet traffic; switching equipment products originate, terminate and route voice traffic; and data equipment products transport internet and voice over internet protocol (“VOIP”) traffic via routers.
Customer Premise Equipment (“CPE”) – CPE includes integrated access devices, channel banks, internet protocol private branch exchange (“IP PBX”) phones, and routers that are placed inside the customer site that will receive the communication signal from the communication services provider.

Revenues attributed to geographic areas are based on the location of the customer.  All of our long-lived assets are located within the United States.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Wireless Segment
 
In 2019, wireless tower and small cell services, including the procurement of the requisite materials, represented substantially all of the Wireless segment’s revenues.  In this segment, we market and sell our products to wireless carriers, wireless equipment providers and tower companies.
Telco Segment
 
Sales of new products represented 30% of revenues and refurbished products represented 61%.  Repair services represented less than 1% of Telco sales.  Recycle sales and other services contributed the remaining 9% of Telco segment revenues.  In this segment, we market and sell our products to franchise and private MSOs, telecommunication companies, system contractors, other industry resellers, enterprise customers and directly to consumers via on-line sales.  Our sales and marketing are predominantly performed by our experienced internal sales and customer service staff, outside sales representatives located in various geographic and strategic areas of the country, and many on-line sales channel platforms such as our own website, Amazon and Newegg.  The majority of our sales activity is generated through customer relationships developed by our sales personnel and executives, referrals from manufacturers we represent, and on-line advertising.
 
We maintain a wide breadth of new and used products and many times can offer our customers same day shipments.  We carry one of the most diverse inventories of any telecommunication product reseller in the country, and we have access to additional inventory via our various supply channels.  We believe our investment in on-hand inventory, our product supply channels, and our experienced sales and customer service team create a competitive advantage for us.
 
Suppliers
 
In fiscal year 2019, the Telco segment did not purchase over 10% of its total inventory purchases from any one supplier.  This segment of our business primarily purchases its used inventory from telecommunication companies and wholesale suppliers that have excess equipment on hand or have upgraded their systems or from other resellers in this industry.
Seasonality
 
In the Wireless segment, the services that we provide on our customers’ wireless towers are outdoors and can be damaged by storms and power surges.  Consequently, we can experience increased demand on certain product offerings during the months between late spring and early fall when severe weather or consistent rain tends to be more 
  5
 
prominent than at other times during the year.  Winter months are generally slower due to the cold weather conditions, and the inability to access wireless towers during periods of heavy snow and ice.
 
In the Telco segment, we do not anticipate that quarterly operating results will generally be impacted by seasonal fluctuations, other than normal business fluctuations during the winter holiday season.
 
Competition
 
Wireless Segment
 
The wireless infrastructure services business competes with other wireless service companies that compete on a local, regional or national basis.  Sometimes, Fulton finds itself providing services in the same markets that its customers can also provide similar services utilizing their in-house personnel.  Most of the direct competition in the Wireless segment comes from regionally based competition of similarly sized companies.  In niche areas of service and in certain markets, the Wireless segment has few competitors due to their expertise and the required investment in equipment and assets.  The level of competition can vary drastically based on demand characteristics in certain markets.
 
For the Wireless segment, we believe our differentiation from other service providers in the marketplace is primarily the following:
 
 
• | Past performance and experience;
--+---------------------------------


• | Robust safety organization;
--+----------------------------


• | Ability to recruit and retain personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | Properly capitalized for equipment and working capital;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad range of master service agreements in place;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | Industry relationships; and
--+----------------------------


• | Having a diversified offering of services based on know-how and equipment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Telco Segment
 
The overall telecommunications equipment industry is highly competitive.  We compete with numerous resellers in the marketplace that sell both direct and on-line.
 
For the Telco segment, we believe our differentiation from other resellers in the marketplace is primarily the following:
 
 
• | Broad range of new, refurbished and used inventory, which allows us to meet our customers’ timing needs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to source unique and sometimes rare, high demand inventory;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Offer a range of repair and testing capabilities to help improve the quality of our inventory as well as offering repair and testing of equipment as a service to our customers and vendors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Experienced sales support staff that maintain strong and longstanding relationships with our customers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sales force that has a strong technical knowledge of the products we offer;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Quality certifications: TL9000 (telecommunications quality certification), ISO 14001 (environmental management certification), OHSAS18000 (occupational safety and health management certification), and R2 (EPA responsible recycling practices for electronics); and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide multiple services for our customers including deinstallation and decommission of products, storage and management of spares inventory and recycling.

Working Capital Practices
 
Working capital practices in our business differ by segment.  In the Wireless segment, we utilize quick payment accounts receivable programs with our major customers and our bank to decrease the amount of time between project completion and payment.  The majority of working capital needs result from the payment of project related costs before invoicing the customer.  This includes personnel, subcontractors, equipment rentals and materials.  Although the quick payment programs are in place to accelerate receivable payments, working capital is necessary to complete the jobs and provide the necessary closeout packages required for customer approval.  In addition, we also have access to our revolving bank line of credit to meet our working capital needs.
  6
 

In the Telco segment, working capital centers on inventory and accounts receivable.  We choose to carry a relatively large volume of inventory due to our on-hand, on-demand business model.  We typically utilize excess cash flows to reinvest in inventory to maintain or expand our product offerings.  The greatest need for working capital occurs when we make bulk purchases of surplus-new and used inventory, or when our OEM suppliers offer additional discounts on large purchases.  Our working capital requirements are generally met by cash flows from operations and our revolving bank line of credit.
 
In the first fiscal quarter of 2019, the Company entered into a new credit agreement with a new financial lender.  This credit agreement contains a $2.5 million revolving line of credit and matures on December 17, 2019.  Future borrowings under the line of credit are limited to the lesser of $2.5 million or the sum of 80% of eligible accounts receivable and 25% of eligible inventory.  Subsequent to September 30, 2019, the Company renewed its revolving bank line of credit for one more year to a maturity date of December 17, 2020.  As part of this renewal, the revolving bank line of credit increased from $2.5 million to $4.0 million.  The other terms of the renewal were essentially the same.  We expect to have sufficient funds available from our cash on hand, future cash flows, quick payment accounts receivable programs and the bank revolving line of credit to meet our working capital needs for the foreseeable future.
 
Significant Customers
 
We are not dependent on a single or few customers to support our business on an on-going basis company-wide.  Sales to our largest customer accounted for approximately 12% of our consolidated sales in fiscal year 2019, while our sales to our largest five customers were 37% of our consolidated sales in fiscal year 2019, four of which were in the Wireless segment and one was in the Telco segment.
Personnel
 
At September 30, 2019, we had 188 employees, including 185 full-time employees.  Management considers its relationships with its employees to be excellent.  Our employees are not unionized, and we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements.
