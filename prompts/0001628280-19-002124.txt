ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

When we use the terms “Ocwen,” “OCN,” “we,” “us” and “our,” we are referring to Ocwen Financial Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
OVERVIEW 
We are a financial services company that services and originates loans. We have a strong track record of success as a leader in the servicing industry in foreclosure prevention and loss mitigation that helps homeowners stay in their homes and improves financial outcomes for mortgage loan investors. This long-standing core competency will continue to be a guiding principle as we move forward. Our near-term priority is to return to profitability in the shortest timeframe possible within an appropriate risk and compliance environment. We believe our acquisition of PHH provides us with the opportunity to transform into a stronger, more efficient company better able to serve our customers and clients, and positions us for a return to growth.
On October 4, 2018, we completed our acquisition of PHH. The aggregate consideration paid to the former holders of PHH common stock was $358.4 million in cash, with $325.0 million funded from PHH’s cash on hand and $33.4 million funded from Ocwen’s cash on hand. The transaction was initially cash and book value accretive, with PHH having an opening cash balance of $423.1 million, $64.7 million more than the purchase price. The purchase price we negotiated contemplated that PHH would incur losses after the acquisition date. PHH’s net loss from continuing operations of $24.8 million is included in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2018.
We have established a set of initiatives to achieve our objective of returning to growth and profitability. Our phase one initiatives address our critical near-term challenges. These include:

• | Execute on the PHH integration to create value;


• | Reengineer our cost structure;


• | Establish funding for growth;


• | Replenish portfolio runoff and restore growth focus; and,


• | Fulfill our regulatory commitments and resolve remaining legacy matters.

We believe the acquisition of PHH will provide the following benefits to enable the execution of the phase one initiatives:

• | Accelerate our transition to Black Knight MSP versus a de novo implementation;


• | Reduce fixed costs, on a combined basis, through reductions in duplicative corporate overhead and other costs;


• | Improve economies of scale through growth in our servicing portfolio; and,


• | Provide a foundation to enable the combined business to resume new business and growth activities that will, at a minimum, offset portfolio runoff.

Key to achieving our cost synergies are the elimination of redundant corporate overhead and completion of the loan transfers to Black Knight MSP. We have successfully completed two transfers, totaling approximately 240,000 loans as of February 27, 2019. The remaining portfolio will be transferred in multiple waves with the final transfer targeted to be completed in the second quarter of 2019. Our integration plans call for extensive pre- and post-transfer testing, quality checks and customer communications and support. To the extent any unexpected challenges are encountered, our transfer timeline may be extended. In addition to eliminating the dual servicing system environment, once we have completed the loan transfers to Black Knight MSP, we plan to drive further expense reductions through greater utilization of the cost advantages of our off-shore infrastructure and reductions in on-shore costs.
While certain restrictions remain, and while we continue to work to satisfy the remaining conditions, we are able to resume some growth activities following our acquisition of PHH. With the easing of restrictions, we intend to pursue origination and acquisition activities that will, at a minimum, replenish our expected annual portfolio runoff. We intend to pursue growth in a responsible and disciplined manner, with return targets that are prudent and aligned with our core competencies. We believe our core competency serving underserved and at-risk borrowers will provide a competitive advantage for certain acquisitions of MSRs. We are also working prudently to expand products and programs to serve underserved customers, including self-employed borrowers and borrowers who ‘just miss’ qualifying for GSE programs, and we are evaluating opportunities to re-enter forward correspondent and other lending channels. 
Our phase two initiatives will focus on ensuring sustainability. These include:

• | Digitizing our business model;


• | Diversifying our business model by leveraging our core competencies; and,


• | Rebuilding our reputation.

We believe leveraging technology to deliver superior accuracy, cost, speed and customer satisfaction is critical to our long- term success. Once we have completed our transition to Black Knight MSP, we will focus our technology efforts on improving 
4

our operating performance by, among others, implementing cognitive technologies to automate repetitive low complexity tasks, and improve our customer experience through implementing digital interfaces. These technologies exist today and are being used throughout the consumer finance industry.
As part of our cost re-engineering plans, we expect to reduce total staffing levels significantly and to close a number of our U.S. facilities. We believe these steps are necessary in order to drive stronger financial performance and, in the longer term, simplify our operations. By the end of 2019, we intend to be primarily operating out of four U.S. and USVI locations: West Palm Beach, FL, Mount Laurel, NJ, Rancho Cordova, CA, and St. Croix, USVI.
We are headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida with offices located throughout the United States (U.S.) and in the USVI and operations in India and the Philippines. Ocwen Financial Corporation is a Florida corporation organized in February 1988. With our predecessors, we have been servicing residential mortgage loans since 1988. We have been originating forward mortgage loans since 2012 and reverse mortgage loans since 2013. 
BUSINESS LINES
Servicing and Lending are our primary lines of business. Our other business activities that are currently individually insignificant are included in the Corporate Items and Other segment. 
Servicing
Our Servicing business is primarily comprised of our core residential mortgage servicing business and currently accounts for most of our total revenues. Our servicing clients include some of the largest financial institutions in the U.S., including the GSEs, Ginnie Mae, NRZ and non-Agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. As of December 31, 2018, our residential servicing portfolio consisted of 1,562,238 loans with an unpaid principal balance (UPB) of $256.0 billion. 
Servicing involves the collection of principal and interest payments from borrowers, the administration of tax and insurance escrow accounts, the collection of insurance claims, the management of loans that are delinquent or in foreclosure or bankruptcy, including making servicing advances, evaluating loans for modification and other loss mitigation activities and, if necessary, foreclosure referrals and the sale of the underlying mortgaged property following foreclosure (REO) on behalf of mortgage loan investors or other servicers. Master servicing involves the collection of payments from servicers and the distribution of funds to investors in mortgage and asset-backed securities and whole loan packages. We earn contractual monthly servicing fees (which are typically payable as a percentage of UPB) pursuant to servicing agreements as well as other ancillary fees relating to our servicing activities such as late fees and, in certain circumstances, REO referral commissions. 
We own MSRs outright, where we receive all the servicing economics, and we subservice on behalf of other institutions that own the MSRs or Rights to MSRs, in which case we earn a fee for performing the subservicing activities. Special servicing is a form of subservicing where we generally manage only delinquent loans on behalf of a loan owner. We typically earn subservicing and special servicing fees either as a percentage of UPB or on a per loan basis.
Servicing advances are an important component of our business and are amounts that we, as servicer, are required to advance to, or on behalf of, our servicing clients if we do not receive such amounts from borrowers. These amounts include principal and interest payments, property taxes and insurance premiums and amounts to maintain, repair and market real estate properties on behalf of our servicing clients. Most of our advances have the highest reimbursement priority such that we are entitled to repayment of the advances from the loan or property liquidation proceeds before most other claims on these proceeds. The costs incurred in meeting advancing obligations consist principally of the interest expense incurred in financing the advance receivables and the costs of arranging such financing.
Reducing delinquencies is important to our business because it enables us to recover advances and recognize additional ancillary income, such as late fees, which we do not recognize on delinquent loans until they are brought current. Performing loans also require less work and thus are generally less costly to service. While increasing borrower participation in loan modification programs is a critical component of our ability to reduce delinquencies, borrower compliance with those modifications is also an important factor.
While we have been successful in reducing the size and costs of our servicing operations in line with declines in our residential servicing portfolio, in order to return to sustainable profitability, we believe we will need to increase the size of our servicing portfolio. While certain restrictions remain, and while we continue to work to satisfy the remaining conditions, we are able to resume some growth activities. With the easing of restrictions, we intend to pursue origination and acquisition activities that will, at a minimum, replenish our expected annual portfolio runoff.
Lending 
In 2018, our Lending business originated or purchased forward and reverse mortgage loans with a UPB of $870.3 million and $593.7 million, respectively. These loans were acquired through three primary channels: directly with mortgage customers (retail), through correspondent lender relationships (correspondent) and through broker relationships (wholesale). Per-loan 
5

margins vary by channel, with correspondent typically being the lowest margin and retail the highest. We exited the forward lending correspondent and wholesale channels in the second and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. Our forward lending business is primarily focused on portfolio recapture (i.e., refinancing loans in our servicing portfolio).
Our forward mortgage loans are conventional (conforming to the underwriting standards of the GSEs, collectively Agency loans) and government-insured (insured by the FHA or VA). After origination, we generally package and sell the loans in the secondary mortgage market, through GSE and Ginnie Mae guaranteed securitizations and whole loan transactions. We typically retain the associated MSRs on securitizations, providing the Servicing business with a source of new MSRs to replenish our servicing portfolio and partially offset the impact of amortization and prepayments, i.e., portfolio runoff. Whole loan transactions are generally completed on a servicing released basis. 
We also originate and purchase Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM or reverse mortgage loans), which are generally insured by the FHA, through our Liberty Home Equity Solutions, Inc. (Liberty) operations. Loans originated under this program are generally guaranteed by the FHA, which provides investors with protection against risk of borrower default. The reverse mortgage channel provides both current period and future period gain on sale revenue from new originations because of subsequent tail draws taken by the borrower. While we focus on current period reported earnings, we also utilize our market experience to invest in future asset value when returns are at attractive levels. These future cash flows are not guaranteed but viewed as probable given our historic asset quality and slow prepayment speeds.
Retail Lending. We originate forward and reverse mortgage loans directly with borrowers through our retail lending business. Our forward lending business benefits from our significant servicing portfolio by offering refinance options to qualified borrowers seeking to lower their mortgage payments. Depending on borrower eligibility, we refinance eligible customers into conforming or government-insured products. We also are increasing our ability to originate retail loans to non-Ocwen servicing customers through various marketing channels and a centralized call center. Through lead campaigns and direct marketing, the retail channel seeks to convert leads into loans in a cost-efficient manner. We are focused on increasing recapture rates on our existing servicing portfolio to grow this business.
Correspondent Lending. Our reverse correspondent lending operation purchases mortgage loans that have been originated by a network of approved third-party lenders. We are currently evaluating re-entering the forward correspondent lending channel.
Wholesale Lending. We originate reverse mortgage loans through a network of approved brokers. Brokers are subject to a formal approval and monitoring process. We underwrite all loans originated through this channel consistent with the underwriting standards required by the ultimate investor prior to funding.
All the lenders participating in our correspondent lending program are approved by senior management members of our lending and compliance teams. We also employ an ongoing monitoring and renewal process for participating lenders that includes an evaluation of the performance of the loans they have sold to us. We perform a variety of pre- and post-funding review procedures to ensure that the loans we purchase conform to our requirements and to the requirements of the investors to whom we sell loans.
We provide customary origination representations and warranties to investors in connection with our loan sales and securitization activities. We receive customary origination representations and warranties from our network of approved originators relating to loans we purchase through our correspondent lending channel. In the event we cannot remedy a breach of a representation or warranty, we may be required to repurchase the loan or provide an indemnification payment to the investor. To the extent that we have recourse against a third-party originator, we may recover part or all of any loss we incur.
The results of operations for each of our reportable operating segments (Servicing, Lending and Corporate Items and Other) are included in the individual business operations sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Financial information related to reportable operating segments is provided in Note 22 — Business Segment Reporting.
REGULATION
Our business is subject to extensive oversight and regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities, including the CFPB, HUD and various state agencies that license and conduct examinations of our loan servicing, origination and collection activities. In addition, we operate under a number of regulatory settlements that subject us to ongoing reporting and other obligations. From time to time, we also receive requests (including requests in the form of subpoenas and civil investigative demands) from federal, state and local agencies for records, documents and information relating to the policies, procedures and practices of our loan servicing, origination and collection activities. The GSEs and their conservator, the Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA), Ginnie Mae, the United States Treasury Department, various investors, non-Agency securitization trustees and others also subject us to periodic reviews and audits.

In the current regulatory environment, we have faced and expect to continue to face heightened regulatory and public scrutiny as an organization as well as stricter and more comprehensive regulation of the entire mortgage sector. We continue to work diligently to assess and understand the implications of the regulatory environment in which we operate and to meet the requirements of this constantly changing environment. We devote substantial resources to regulatory compliance, while, at the same time, striving to meet the needs and expectations of our customers, clients and other stakeholders. Our actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and licensing requirements could lead to any of the following:

• | loss of our licenses and approvals to engage in our servicing and lending businesses;


• | governmental investigations and enforcement actions;


• | administrative fines and penalties and litigation;


• | civil and criminal liability, including class action lawsuits and actions to recover incentive and other payments made by governmental entities;


• | breaches of covenants and representations under our servicing, debt or other agreements;


• | damage to our reputation;


• | inability to raise capital; or


• | inability to execute on our business strategy.

In addition to amounts paid to resolve regulatory matters, we incur costs to comply with the terms of such resolutions, including the costs of third-party firms to monitor our compliance with such resolutions. We recognized $177.5 million in such third-party monitoring costs relating to the 2013 Ocwen National Mortgage Settlement, our 2014 settlement with the New York Department of Financial Services (NY DFS) and our 2015 settlement with the California Department of Business Oversight (CA DBO). Further, as described below, the costs of complying with our regulatory settlements include the costs of conducting an escrow analysis, Maryland organizational assessments, Massachusetts data integrity audits, and transition to Black Knight MSP. The remediation of errors identified during the escrow analysis could result in payments, credits or other actions to remediate such errors and other actions could be taken against us by regulators or others with respect to such errors. 
We must comply with a large number of federal, state and local consumer protection laws including, among others, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, as well as individual state laws pertaining to licensing, general mortgage origination and servicing practices and foreclosure, and federal and local bankruptcy rules. These statutes apply to many facets of our business, including loan origination, default servicing and collections, use of credit reports, safeguarding of non-public personally identifiable information about our customers, foreclosure and claims handling, investment of and interest payments on escrow balances and escrow payment features, and mandate certain disclosures and notices to borrowers. These requirements can and do change as statutes and regulations are enacted, promulgated, amended, interpreted and enforced.
In recent years, the general trend among federal, state and local lawmakers and regulators has been toward increasing laws, regulations and investigative proceedings with regard to residential mortgage lenders and servicers. The CFPB continues to take a very active role in the mortgage industry, and its rule-making and regulatory agenda relating to loan servicing and origination continues to evolve. Individual states have also been active, as have other regulatory organizations such as the Multistate Mortgage Committee (MMC), a multistate coalition of various mortgage banking regulators. We also believe there has been a shift among certain regulators towards a broader view of the scope of regulatory oversight responsibilities with respect to mortgage lenders and servicers. In addition to their traditional focus on licensing and examination matters, certain regulators have begun to make observations, recommendations or demands with respect to areas such as corporate governance, safety and soundness and risk and compliance management. 
The CFPB and state regulators have also focused on the use and adequacy of technology in the mortgage servicing industry. In 2016, the CFPB issued a special edition supervision report that stressed the need for mortgage servicers to assess and make necessary improvements to their information technology systems to ensure compliance with the CFPB’s mortgage servicing requirements. The NY DFS also issued Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies, which took effect in 2017, and which required banks, insurance companies, and other financial services institutions regulated by the NY DFS to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers and ensure the safety and soundness of New York State’s financial services industry.
New regulatory and legislative measures, or changes in enforcement practices, including those related to the technology we use, could, either individually or in the aggregate, require significant changes to our business practices, impose additional costs on us, limit our product offerings, limit our ability to efficiently pursue business opportunities, negatively impact asset values or reduce our revenues.
7

We are subject to a number of ongoing federal and state regulatory examinations, consent orders, inquiries, subpoenas, civil investigative demands, requests for information and other actions, which could result in further adverse regulatory action against us. 
To the extent that an examination, audit or other regulatory engagement identifies an alleged failure by us to comply with applicable laws, regulations or licensing requirements, or if allegations are made that we have failed to comply with applicable laws, regulations or licensing requirements or the commitments we have made in connection with our regulatory settlements (whether such allegations are made through administrative actions such as cease and desist orders, through legal proceedings or otherwise) or if other regulatory actions of a similar or different nature are taken in the future against us, this could lead to (i) administrative fines and penalties and litigation, (ii) loss of our licenses and approvals to engage in our servicing and lending businesses, (iii) governmental investigations and enforcement actions, (iv) civil and criminal liability, including class action lawsuits and actions to recover incentive and other payments made by governmental entities, (v) breaches of covenants and representations under our servicing, debt or other agreements, (vi) damage to our reputation, (vii) inability to raise capital or otherwise fund our operations and (viii) inability to execute on our business strategy. Any of these occurrences could increase our operating expenses and reduce our revenues, hamper our ability to grow or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.
Finally, there are a number of foreign laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations outside of the U.S., including laws and regulations that govern licensing, employment, safety, taxes and insurance and laws and regulations that govern the creation, continuation and the winding up of companies as well as the relationships between shareholders, our corporate entities, the public and the government in these countries. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations could result in adverse actions against us, including (i) restrictions on our operations in these counties, (ii) fines, penalties or sanctions or (iii) reputational damage.
CFPB
In April 2017, the CFPB filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the Southern District of Florida against Ocwen, Ocwen Mortgage Servicing, Inc. (OMS) and Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (OLS) alleging violations of federal consumer financial laws relating to our servicing business dating back to 2014. The CFPB’s claims include allegations regarding (1) the adequacy of Ocwen’s servicing system and integrity of Ocwen’s mortgage servicing data, (2) Ocwen’s foreclosure practices and (3) various purported servicer errors with respect to borrower escrow accounts, hazard insurance policies, timely cancellation of private mortgage insurance, handling of customer complaints, and marketing of optional products. The CFPB alleges violations of unfair, deceptive acts or abusive practices, as well as violations of specific laws or regulations. The CFPB does not claim specific monetary damages, although it does seek consumer relief, disgorgement of allegedly improper gains, and civil money penalties. We believe we have factual and legal defenses to the CFPB’s allegations and are vigorously defending ourselves. 
Prior to the CFPB instituting legal proceedings, we had been engaged with the CFPB in efforts to resolve the matter. We have recorded $12.5 million as of December 31, 2018 as a result of these discussions. If we are successful in defending ourselves against the CFPB, it is possible that our losses could be less than $12.5 million. It is also possible that we could incur losses that materially exceed the amount accrued, and the resolution of the matters raised by the CFPB could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. We cannot currently estimate the amount, if any, of reasonably possible loss above amounts previously accrued.
State Licensing, State Attorneys General and Other Matters
Our licensed entities are required to renew their licenses, typically on an annual basis, and to do so they must satisfy the license renewal requirements of each jurisdiction, which generally include financial requirements such as providing audited financial statements or satisfying minimum net worth requirements and non-financial requirements such as satisfactorily completing examinations as to the licensee’s compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The minimum net worth requirements to which our licensed entities are subject are unique to each state and type of license. We believe our licensed entities were in compliance with all of their minimum net worth requirements at December 31, 2018. However, it is possible that regulators could disagree with our calculations, and one state regulator has disagreed with our calculation for a prior year period; we are currently discussing the matter with the regulator. Failure to satisfy any of the requirements to which our licensed entities are subject could result in a variety of regulatory actions ranging from a fine, a directive requiring a certain step to be taken, a suspension or ultimately a revocation of a license, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we receive information requests and other inquiries, both formal and informal in nature, from our state regulators as part of their general regulatory oversight of our servicing and lending businesses. We also regularly engage with state attorneys general and the CFPB and, on occasion, we engage with other federal agencies, including the Department of Justice and various inspectors general on various matters, including responding to information requests and other inquiries. Many of our regulatory engagements arise from a complaint that the entity is investigating, although some are formal investigations or proceedings. The GSEs and their conservator, FHFA, HUD, FHA, 
8

VA, Ginnie Mae, the United States Treasury Department, and others also subject us to periodic reviews and audits. We have in the past resolved, and may in the future resolve, matters via consent orders or payment of monetary amounts to settle issues identified in connection with examinations or regulatory or other oversight activities, and such resolutions could have material and adverse effects on our business, reputation, operations, results of operations and financial condition.
In April 2017 and shortly thereafter, mortgage and banking regulatory agencies from 29 states and the District of Columbia took regulatory actions against OLS and certain other Ocwen companies that alleged deficiencies in our compliance with laws and regulations relating to our servicing and lending activities. In general, the regulatory actions took the form of “cease and desist orders,” and we use that term to refer to all the orders for ease of reference; for ease of reference, we also include the District of Columbia as a state when we reference states below. All the cease and desist orders were applicable to OLS, but additional Ocwen entities were named in some orders, including Ocwen Financial Corporation, OMS, Homeward Residential, Inc. (Homeward) and Liberty. Following the issuance of the orders, we reached agreements with certain regulatory agencies to obtain delays in the enforcement of certain terms or exceptions to certain terms contained in the cease and desist orders. Additionally, we revised our operations based on the terms of the orders while we sought to negotiate resolutions.
We entered into agreements with all 29 states plus the District of Columbia to resolve these regulatory actions. These agreements generally contained the following key terms (the Multi-State Common Settlement Terms):

• | Ocwen would not acquire any new residential MSRs until April 30, 2018.


• | Ocwen would develop a plan of action and milestones regarding its transition from the REALServicing® servicing system to an alternate servicing system and, with certain exceptions, would not board any new loans onto the REALServicing system.


• | In the event that Ocwen chose to merge with or acquire an unaffiliated company or its assets in order to effectuate a transfer of loans from the REALServicing system, Ocwen was required to comply with regulatory notice and waiting period requirements.


• | Ocwen would engage a third-party auditor to perform an analysis with respect to our compliance with certain federal and state laws relating to escrow by testing approximately 9,000 loan files relating to residential real property in various states, and Ocwen would develop corrective action plans for any errors identified by the third-party auditor.


• | Ocwen would develop and submit for review a plan to enhance our consumer complaint handling processes.


• | Ocwen would provide financial condition reporting on a confidential basis as part of each state’s supervisory framework through September 2020.

In addition to the terms described above, Ocwen entered into settlements with certain states on different or additional terms, which include making additional communications with and for borrowers, certain restrictions, certain review, reporting and remediation obligations, and the following additional terms:

• | Ocwen agreed with the Connecticut Department of Banking to pay certain amounts only in the event we fail to comply with certain requirements under our agreement with Connecticut.


• | In its agreement with the Maryland Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation, Ocwen agreed to complete an independent management assessment and enterprise risk assessment and to a prohibition, with certain de minimis exceptions, on repurchases of our stock until December 7, 2018. Ocwen also agreed to make certain payments to Maryland, to provide remediation to certain borrowers in the form of cash payments or credits and to pay certain amounts only in the event we fail to comply with certain requirements under our agreement with Maryland.


• | Ocwen agreed with the Massachusetts Division of Banks to pay $1.0 million to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Mortgage Education Trust. Ocwen and the Massachusetts regulatory agency also agreed on a schedule pursuant to which we will regain eligibility to acquire residential MSRs on Massachusetts loans (including loans originated by Ocwen) as it meets certain thresholds in its transition to a new servicing system. All restrictions on Massachusetts MSR acquisitions will be lifted when Ocwen completes the second phase of a three-phase data integrity audit which will be conducted by an independent third-party following completion of Ocwen’s servicing system transition. The first phase of this audit, which was required to be completed prior to transitioning any Massachusetts loans to a new servicing system, has already been completed.


• | Ocwen agreed with the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance until April 30, 2019, to limit its growth through acquisition from correspondent relationships to no more than ten percent per year for Nebraska loans (based on the total number of loans held at the prior calendar year-end).

In addition to the payments described above, we will also incur costs complying with the terms of these settlements, including in connection with the escrow analysis, Maryland organizational assessments, Massachusetts data integrity audits,
and transition to Black Knight MSP. The remediation of errors identified during the escrow analysis could result in payments, credits or other actions to remediate such errors and other actions could be taken against us by regulators or others with respect to such errors.

Although we have resolved all of the administrative actions taken by state regulators in April 2017 and shortly thereafter, we have not resolved all of the legal actions. In April 2017, and concurrent with the issuance of the cease and desist orders and the filing of the CFPB lawsuit discussed above, two state attorneys general took actions against us relating to our servicing practices. The Florida Attorney General, together with the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the Southern District of Florida against Ocwen, OMS and OLS alleging violations of federal and state consumer financial laws relating to our servicing business. These claims are similar to the claims made by the CFPB. The Florida lawsuit seeks injunctive and equitable relief, costs, and civil money penalties in excess of $10,000 per confirmed violation of the applicable statute. As previously disclosed, the Massachusetts Attorney General had sent us a civil investigative demand requesting information relating to various aspects of our servicing practices, including lender-placed insurance and property preservation fees. Subsequently, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a lawsuit against OLS in the Superior Court for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts alleging violations of state consumer financial laws relating to our servicing business, including with respect to our activities relating to lender-placed insurance and property preservation fees. The Massachusetts Attorney General’s lawsuit seeks injunctive and equitable relief, costs, and civil money penalties of $5,000 per confirmed violation of the applicable statute. While we endeavor to negotiate appropriate resolutions in these two matters, we are vigorously defending ourselves, as we believe we have valid defenses to the claims made in both lawsuits. The outcome of these two lawsuits, whether through negotiated settlements, court rulings or otherwise, could potentially involve monetary fines or penalties or additional restrictions on our business and could be materially adverse to our business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 
Certain of the state regulators’ cease and desist orders referenced a confidential supervisory memorandum of understanding (MOU) that we entered into with the MMC and six states relating to a servicing examination from 2013 to 2015. The MOU contained various provisions relating to servicing practices and safety and soundness aspects of the regulatory review, as a step toward closing the 2013 - 2015 examination. Ocwen responded to the MOU items and continues to provide certain reports and other information pursuant to the MOU. There were no monetary or other penalties imposed under the MOU. However, the MOU prohibited us from repurchasing stock during the development of a going forward plan and, thereafter, except as permitted by the plan. We prepared and submitted a plan that contained no stock repurchase restrictions and, therefore, we do not believe we are currently restricted from repurchasing stock. However, the MMC may not agree with our interpretation. For this reason, and on the basis of our progress to date responding to our obligations under the MOU, we have requested that the MOU be terminated. To the extent that we cannot terminate the MOU, we may remain subject to a share repurchase restriction and continued reporting obligations.
In January 2018, prior to our acquisition of PHH, PHH Mortgage Corporation (PMC) entered into a settlement agreement with the MMC and consent orders with certain state attorneys general to resolve and close out findings of an MMC examination of PMC’s legacy mortgage servicing practices. Under the terms of these settlements, PMC agreed to comply with certain servicing standards, to conduct testing of compliance with such servicing standards for a period of three years, and to report to the MMC regarding the same. To the extent PMC does not comply with the terms of the servicing standards, the MMC or state attorneys general could take regulatory action against us, including imposing fines or penalties or otherwise restricting our business activities. 
Other Matters 
On occasion, we engage with agencies of the federal government on various matters. For example, OLS received a letter from the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, notifying OLS that the Department of Justice had initiated a general investigation into OLS’s policies and procedures to determine whether violations of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act by OLS might exist. We continue to provide information to the Department of Justice and we are engaged in ongoing discussions with the Department of Justice relating to this inquiry. In addition, Ocwen was named as a defendant in a HUD administrative complaint filed by a non-profit organization alleging discrimination in the manner in which the company maintains REO properties in minority communities. In February 2018, this matter was administratively closed; and similar claims were filed in federal court. We believe these claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves. 
In April 2017, Ocwen received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General of HUD requesting the production of documentation related to lender-placed insurance arrangements with a mortgage insurer and the amounts paid for such insurance. We understand that other servicers in the industry have received similar subpoenas. In May 2016, Ocwen received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General of HUD requesting the production of documentation related to HECM loans originated by Liberty. We understand that other lenders in the industry have received similar subpoenas. In May 2017, Ocwen received a subpoena from the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) requesting the production of documents related to Ocwen’s participation from 2009 to the present in the Treasury Department’s Making Home Affordable Program and its Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). We have been providing documents and information in response to these subpoenas.

New York Department of Financial Services
In March 2017, we entered into a consent order with the NY DFS (the 2017 NY Consent Order) that provided for the termination of the engagement of a monitor appointed pursuant to an earlier 2014 consent order and for us to address certain concerns raised by the NY DFS that primarily relate to our servicing operations, as well as for us to comply with certain reporting and other obligations. In addition, in connection with the NY DFS’ approval in September 2018, of our acquisition of PHH, we agreed to satisfy certain post-closing requirements, including reporting obligations and record retention and other requirements relating to the transfer of loans collateralized by New York property (New York loans) onto Black Knight MSP and certain requirements with respect to the evaluation and supervision of management of both Ocwen Financial Corporation and PMC. In addition, we are prohibited from boarding any additional loans onto the current REALServicing system and we must transfer all New York loans off the REALServicing system by April 30, 2020. The conditional approval also modified a preexisting restriction on our ability to acquire MSRs such that the restriction applies only to New York loans and, with respect to New York loans, provides that Ocwen may not increase its aggregate portfolio of New York loans serviced or subserviced by Ocwen by more than 2% per year (based on the unpaid principal balance of loans serviced at the prior calendar year-end). This restriction will remain in place until the NY DFS determines that all loans serviced on the REALServicing system have been successfully migrated to Black Knight MSP and that Ocwen has developed a satisfactory infrastructure to board sizable portfolios of MSRs.
We continue to work with the NY DFS to address matters they continue to raise with us as well as to fulfill our commitments under the 2017 NY Consent Order and PHH acquisition conditional approval. To the extent that we fail to address adequately any concerns raised by the NY DFS or fail to fulfill our commitments to the NY DFS, the NY DFS could take regulatory action against us, including imposing fines or penalties or otherwise restricting our business activities. Any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition liquidity and results of operations. 
California Department of Business Oversight
On February 17, 2017, OLS and two other subsidiaries, Ocwen Business Solutions, Inc. (OBS) and Ocwen Financial Solutions Private Limited (OFSPL), reached an agreement, in three consent orders (collectively, the 2017 CA Consent Order), with the CA DBO that terminated an earlier 2015 consent order and resolved open matters between the CA DBO and OLS, OBS and OFSPL, including certain matters relating to OLS’ servicing practices and the licensed activities of OBS and OFSPL. We have certain remaining reporting and other obligations under the 2017 CA Consent Order. Pursuant to the 2017 CA Consent Order, the CA DBO has engaged a third-party administrator who, at the expense of the CA DBO, has commenced work to confirm that Ocwen has completed certain commitments under the 2017 CA Consent Order. Still outstanding, however, is our completion of $198.0 million in debt forgiveness for California borrowers by June 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we estimate that we have approximately $15.0 million of debt forgiveness remaining to complete. Based on internal forecasting, we currently believe that we will be able to complete this requirement by June 30, 2019. However, if we are unable to complete this requirement by the deadline or obtain an extension, the 2017 CA Consent Order obligates us to pay the remaining amount to the CA DBO in cash. Our debt forgiveness activities take place as we modify loans - our loan modifications are designed to be sustainable for homeowners while providing a net present value for mortgage loan investors that is superior to that of foreclosure. Debt forgiveness as part of a loan modification is determined on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the applicable servicing agreement. Debt forgiveness does not involve an expense to Ocwen other than the operating expense incurred in arranging the modification, which is part of Ocwen’s role as loan servicer. If the CA DBO were to allege that we failed to comply with our obligations under the 2017 CA Consent Order or that we otherwise were in breach of applicable laws, regulations or licensing requirements, the CA DBO could also take regulatory actions against us, including imposing fines or penalties or otherwise restricting our business activities. Any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition liquidity and results of operations.
COMPETITION 
The financial services markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete with large and small financial services companies, including bank and non-bank entities, in the servicing and lending markets. Our competitors include large banks, such as Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citibank, large non-bank servicers such as Mr. Cooper and Ditech Financial, market disruptors such as Quicken Loans, SunTrust Mortgage and Regions Mortgage who are aggressively investing in the digital transformation of their business platforms, and real estate investment trusts, including New Residential Investment Corp.
In the servicing industry, we compete based on price, quality and counterparty risk. Potential counterparties also (1) assess our regulatory compliance track record and examine our systems and processes for maintaining and demonstrating regulatory compliance, (2) consider our customer satisfaction rankings, and (3) consider our third-party servicer ratings. Certain of our competitors, especially large banks, may have substantially lower costs of capital and greater financial resources, which makes it challenging to compete. We believe that our competitive strengths flow from our ability to control and drive down delinquencies using proprietary processes and our lower cost to service non-performing, non-Agency loans. Notwithstanding 
11

these strengths, we have suffered reputational damage as a result of our regulatory settlements and the associated scrutiny of our business. We believe this has weakened our competitive position against both our bank and non-bank servicing competitors. 
In the lending industry, we face intense competition in most areas, including product offerings, rates, fees and customer service. Some of our competitors, including the larger banks, have substantially lower costs of capital and strong retail presence, which makes it challenging to compete. In addition, with the proliferation of smartphones and technological changes enabling improved payment systems and cheaper data storage, newer market participants, often called “disruptors,” are reinventing aspects of the financial industry and capturing profit pools previously enjoyed by existing market participants. As a result, the lending industry could become even more competitive if new market participants are successful in capturing market share from existing market participants such as ourselves. We believe our competitive strengths flow from our existing role as a mortgage servicer, which provides us with an existing customer relationship to capture refinance volume from our servicing portfolio and from our customer service. 
The reverse lending market faces many of the same competitive pressures as the forward market. In addition, the reverse market is significantly smaller than the forward market with a higher market share concentration among the top five Ginnie Mae HMBS issuers. These higher concentration levels can, at times, lead to significant price competition. We believe our competitive advantage flows from Liberty’s long tenure in the industry (Liberty began operations in 2004), which provides us with significant experience and contributes to our name recognition, our strategic partnerships and our use of technology to produce higher levels of productivity to drive down per-loan costs.
THIRD-PARTY SERVICER RATINGS
Like other servicers, we are the subject of mortgage servicer ratings or rankings (collectively, ratings) issued and revised from time to time by rating agencies including Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s), S&P Global Ratings, Inc. (S&P) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch). Favorable ratings from these agencies are important to the conduct of our loan servicing and lending businesses.
The following table summarizes our key ratings by these rating agencies:

(1) | Moody’s placed the OLS servicer ratings on Watch for Downgrade on April 24, 2017.

In addition to servicer ratings, each of the rating agencies will from time to time assign an outlook (or a ratings watch such as Moody’s review status) to the rating status of a mortgage servicer. A negative outlook is generally used to indicate that a rating “may be lowered,” while a positive outlook is generally used to indicate a rating “may be raised.”
Downgrades in servicer ratings could adversely affect our ability to sell or finance servicing advances and could impair our ability to consummate future servicing transactions or adversely affect our dealings with lenders, other contractual counterparties, and regulators, including our ability to maintain our status as an approved servicer by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The servicer rating requirements of Fannie Mae do not necessarily require or imply immediate action, as Fannie Mae has discretion with respect to whether we are in compliance with their requirements and what actions it deems appropriate under the circumstances if we fall below their desired servicer ratings.
See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business for further discussion of the adverse effects that a failure to maintain minimum servicer ratings could have on our business, financing activities, financial condition or results of operations.

NEW RESIDENTIAL INVESTMENT CORP. RELATIONSHIP 
NRZ is our largest servicing counterparty, and consequently our servicing business is highly dependent on our continued relationship with NRZ. NRZ related servicing accounted for 51% of the UPB of residential assets serviced as of December 31, 2018. We service loans on behalf of NRZ under various agreements including in connection with Rights to MSRs, where Ocwen retains legal title to the underlying MSRs but NRZ has generally assumed risks and rewards consistent with an MSR owner, and traditional subservicing agreements, where NRZ is the legal MSR owner. As legal MSR owner, or in compliance with the Rights to MSRs agreements, NRZ is responsible to finance all servicing advance obligations in connection with the loans underlying the MSRs. At December 31, 2018, such servicing advances were approximately $2.7 billion.
The Ocwen subservicing agreement has an initial five-year term, ending July 2022. NRZ may terminate the agreements for convenience, subject to Ocwen’s right to receive a termination fee and proper notice at any time during the initial five-year term. The subservicing agreement can be renewed for three-month terms at NRZ’s option. In addition to a base servicing fee, we receive ancillary income, which primarily includes late fees, loan modification fees and Speedpay® fees. NRZ receives all float earnings and deferred servicing fees related to delinquent borrower payments, as well as certain REO-related income including REO referral commissions. 
We are currently working towards obtaining the remaining third-party consents to transfer legal title to NRZ for all of the MSRs such that in the future the relationship will be purely a subservicing relationship. With respect to its Rights to MSRs interests, NRZ has the right to sell its servicing rights to a third party if these third-party consents are not obtained and Ocwen does not elect to purchase NRZ’s servicing rights. If NRZ sells its servicing rights to a third party, the transaction can only be completed if the third-party buyer can obtain the necessary third-party consents to transfer the MSRs as required pursuant to the underlying servicing agreements. NRZ also has the obligation to use reasonable efforts to encourage such third-party buyer to enter into a subservicing agreement with Ocwen. However, Ocwen would lose future compensation for subservicing, if no subservicing agreement were ultimately entered into with the third-party buyer.
The PHH subservicing agreement has an initial three-year term, ending June 2020, and contain certain transfer and termination provisions whereby NRZ has the ability to terminate over the three-year term, beginning with the ability to terminate with respect to 25% of the loans covered thereby in June 2018 and 25% beginning in June 2019. NRZ has not provided notice of termination under this 25% termination provision. The PHH subservicing agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms. Both NRZ and PHH have the right to terminate the subservicing agreement without cause with proper notice. In addition to a base servicing fee based on the delinquency status of each loan, we also receive and ancillary income, which primarily includes late fees, loan modification fees and Speedpay fees.
ALTISOURCE VENDOR RELATIONSHIP 
Each of Ocwen Financial Corporation and OMS are parties to a Services Agreement, a Technology Products Services Agreement, an Intellectual Property Agreement and a Data Center and Disaster Recovery Services Agreement with a subsidiary of Altisource. Under the Services Agreements, Altisource provides residential property valuation services, property preservation and inspection services and title services, among other things. Altisource provides certain technology products and support services under the Technology Products Services Agreements and the Data Center and Disaster Recovery Services Agreements, including licensing us the REALServicing loan servicing system under a statement of work under the Technology Products Services Agreements. These agreements expire August 31, 2025. Ocwen and Altisource have also entered into a Master Services Agreement pursuant to which Altisource provides title services to Liberty and a General Referral Fee agreement pursuant to which Ocwen receives referral fees that are paid out of the commission that would otherwise be paid to Altisource as the selling broker in connection with certain real estate sales.
We are currently in the process of transitioning to Black Knight MSP to REALServicing. On February 22, 2019, Ocwen and Altisource S.à r.l (a subsidiary of Altisource) signed a Binding Term Sheet, which among other things, confirms Altisource’s cooperation with the de-boarding of loans from Altisource’s REALServicing servicing system to Black Knight’s MSP servicing system. The Binding Term Sheet also includes provisions regarding assuring that data is accurately transferred to Ocwen, including Ocwen having the ability to verify data accuracy and having continued access to the REALServicing system for an acceptable period of time. We have successfully completed two transfers of loans to Black Knight MSP, totaling approximately 240,000 loans, as of February 27, 2019. 
The Binding Term Sheet also amends certain provisions set forth in the Services Agreements. After certain conditions have been met and where Ocwen has the right to select the services provider, Ocwen will use Altisource to provide the types of services that Altisource currently provides under the Services Agreements for at least 90% of services for all portfolios for which Ocwen is the servicer or subservicer, except that Altisource will be the provider for all such services for the portfolios: (i) acquired by Ocwen pursuant to loan servicing under agreements from Homeward (acquired in 2012) or assigned and assumed by Ocwen from Residential Capital, LLC, et al (assets acquired in 2013); and (ii) acquired from Ocwen, excluding certain portfolios in which PHH has an interest, by NRZ or its affiliates prior to the date of the Binding Term Sheet. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Altisource will be the provider of mortgage charge-off collections services under the Services 
13

Agreements. The Binding Term Sheet also sets forth a framework for negotiating additional service level changes in the future. As specified in the Binding Term Sheet, if Altisource fails certain performance standards for specified periods of time, then Ocwen may terminate Altisource as a provider for the applicable service(s), subject to Altisource’s right to cure. For certain claims arising from referrals received by Altisource after the effective date of the Binding Term Sheet, the provisions include reciprocal indemnification obligations in the event of negligence by either Party and Altisource’s indemnification obligations of Ocwen in the event of any breach by Altisource of its obligations under the Services Agreements. The limitations of liability provisions include an exception for losses either party suffers as a result of third-party claims.
USVI OPERATIONS
As part of an initiative to reorganize the ownership and management of our global servicing assets and operations under a single entity and cost-effectively expand our U.S.-based origination and servicing activities, Ocwen formed OMS in 2012 under the laws of the USVI where OMS is incorporated and has its principal place of business. OMS is headquartered in Christiansted, St. Croix, USVI and is located in a federally recognized economic development zone where qualified entities are eligible for certain tax benefits. We refer to these benefits as “EDC Benefits” as they are granted by the USVI Economic Development Commission (EDC). We were approved as a Category IIA service business, and are therefore entitled to receive significant benefits that may have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate. These benefits, among others, enable us to avail ourselves of a credit of 90% of income taxes on certain qualified income related to our servicing business. The exemption was granted as of October 1, 2012 and is available for a period of 30 years until expiration on September 30, 2042. Although we are eligible for a reduced tax rate in the USVI, the reduced tax rate has not provided Ocwen with a foreign tax benefit in recent tax years as we have been incurring taxable losses in the USVI. 
In connection with the acquisition of PHH and our overall corporate simplification and cost reduction efforts, we are planning a legal entity reorganization that will involve our two primary licensed entities, OLS and Homeward merging into PHH’s primary licensed entity, PMC. As a result of this reorganization, a portion of our USVI operations and assets will be transferred to the U.S. We plan to continue to maintain operations and the EDC Benefits in the USVI until, through and after the reorganization. We expect the reorganization to result in efficiencies and operational cost savings through reduced complexity and a simplification of our global structure. 
On December 22, 2017, significant revisions to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, were signed into law (Tax Act). The newly enacted federal income tax law, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), and a new minimum tax enacted to prevent companies from stripping earnings out of the U.S. through U.S. tax deductible payments made to foreign affiliates. The reduction in the statutory U.S. federal rate is expected to positively impact our future U.S. after-tax earnings. However, the ultimate impact of the Tax Act on our future after tax earnings is subject to the effect of other complex provisions in the Tax Act, including the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI), and revised interest deductibility limitations. It is possible that the impact of these provisions could significantly reduce the benefit of the reduction in the statutory U.S. federal rate and may also negatively impact the tax advantages received from the EDC Benefits. In addition, Ocwen is continuing to evaluate the impact of the new tax legislation and guiding regulations (which are still being promulgated and finalized) on its global tax position. Certain provisions of the new tax laws and regulations are currently expected to result in an increase to our current income tax obligations. 
EMPLOYEES
We had a total of approximately 7,200 and 7,600 employees at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We maintain operations in the U.S., USVI, India and the Philippines. At December 31, 2018, approximately 4,100 of our employees were located in India and approximately 500 were based in the Philippines. Of our foreign-based employees, more than 80% were engaged in our Servicing operations as of December 31, 2018. Because of the large number of employees in India, our operations could be impacted by significant changes to the political or economic conditions in India or in the political or regulatory climate in the U.S. with respect to U.S. businesses engaging in foreign operations. If we had to curtail or cease our operations in India and transfer some or all of these operations to another geographic area, we could incur significant transition costs as well as higher future overhead costs that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
