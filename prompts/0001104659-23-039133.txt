ITEM 1:     BUSINESS
Our Company
Ideal Power Inc. was formed in Texas on May 17, 2007 and converted to a Delaware corporation on July 15, 2013. Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms “Ideal Power,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to Ideal Power Inc.
We are solely focused on the further development and commercialization of our Bidirectional bipolar junction TRANsistor (B-TRAN™) solid-state switch technology. 
To date, operations have been funded primarily through the sale of common stock and we have generated $3.7 million in grant revenue for bidirectional power switch development. Grant revenue was $203,269 and $576,399 in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We may pursue additional research and development grants, if and when available, to further develop and/or improve our technology. We are in the process of commercializing our B-TRAN™ technology. 
Product Launch
In January 2023, we launched our first commercial product, the SymCool™ Power Module. This multi-die B-TRAN™ module is designed to meet the very low conduction loss needs of the solid-state circuit breaker (SSCB) market. We expect fabrication and initial sales of this product later in 2023.
Development Agreement
During the fourth quarter of 2022, we announced, and began Phase 1 of, a product development agreement with a top 10 global automaker for a custom B-TRAN™ power module for use in the automaker’s electric vehicle (“EV”) drivetrain inverters in its next generation EV platform. In Phase I of the program, we will provide packaged B-TRAN™ devices, drivers and technical data to the top 10 global automaker for their evaluation. Our expectation is that a successful Phase 1 will lead to us securing Phase 2 of the program. Assuming we secure Phase 2 of the program, we will collaborate with a packaging company selected by the automaker that will fabricate the custom B-TRAN™ modules. In Phase 3, the final development phase under the program, the custom B-TRAN™ power module is expected to be tested and certified in accordance with automotive codes and standards. The delivery of production-ready B-TRAN™-based modules is targeted for 2025. We expect to record modest revenue under this agreement in 2023.
Test and Evaluation Agreements
During 2021 and 2022, we announced several test and evaluation agreements with prospective customers, including a second top 10 global automaker, a top 10 global provider of power conversion solutions to the solar industry, a global diverse power management market leader, a commercial EV manufacturer and an EV charging company. These companies, along with other and future participants in our test and evaluation program, intend to test and evaluate the B-TRAN™ for use in their applications. We expect to incorporate the feedback from these customers into our future commercial products.
Industry Background
A semiconductor material is a substance that is characterized for “conducting” electricity easily, while at the same time, working as an insulator to prevent the flow of electricity. By using semiconductors, it becomes possible to perform rectification for the one-directional flow of electricity, amplification for increasing electrical signals, and switching to open and close the flow of electricity.
Power semiconductors possess a structure that is different from regular semiconductors, enabling them to handle high voltages and large currents without damage. Failures may occur due to a rise in temperatures resulting from heat generated from handling large amounts of power. Therefore, methods have been developed to reduce the amount of power semiconductor loss, which is the cause of the heat generation, while also effectively releasing the generated heat to the outside.

Power semiconductors are mostly used in power conversion such as in changing voltages and frequencies, as well as changing direct current (“DC”) to alternating current (“AC”) and AC to DC. Power semiconductors play an indispensable role in accurately driving motors from low to high speeds, controlling the voltage and flow of electricity in electric and hybrid electric vehicles, supplying power grids with power generated from solar cells or wind turbines with less power loss, and providing a stable source of electricity to various home appliances and electrical equipment. In recent years, there has been a greater demand for energy-savings and power consumption reductions and growing demand for electric vehicles and, as a result, the need for power semiconductors that minimize power loss has been increasing.
Power semiconductors are solid-state devices that act as a switch without any mechanical movement. Solid-state devices are completely made from a solid material, typically silicon, and their flow of charges is confined within this solid material. The term solid-state is often used to show a difference from the earlier technologies of vacuum and gas-discharge tube devices and also to exclude the conventional electro-mechanical devices such as relays, switches, hard drives and other devices with moving parts. Solid-state devices are typically smaller, lighter and faster acting than electro-mechanical devices.
The global power semiconductor market may be categorized by component, material, end-use and geography. Based on component, the market includes power metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (“MOSFETs”), thyristors, rectifiers, bipolar junction transistors, insulated gate bipolar transistors (“IGBTs”) and power diodes. With respect to material, the power semiconductor market is split several ways into silicon, germanium, silicon carbide and gallium nitride.
The end-use market is classified into automotive, industrial, renewable energy, telecommunication, consumer electronics, aerospace and defense, healthcare and others. Among these, automotive electronics accounts for significant consumption of power semiconductors. The number of semiconductors in vehicles has surged in recent years with the rising adoption of electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. Further, the advent of drive-by-wire or x-by-wire technologies have led to a rise in number of electric components in vehicles over mechanical vehicle parts. This rise helps reduce vehicle weight which is directly related to improved fuel efficiency and reduced vehicular emissions. The heavy consumption of power semiconductors across several end-use markets such as industrial, automotive, consumer electronics and renewable energy is a key growth driver of the power semiconductor market.
The telecommunications market is also a significant end-user of power semiconductors. This segment displays demand for radio frequency power amplifiers and IGBTs among others. With the launch of 5G, the demand for power semiconductors has increased.
Geographically, Asia Pacific accounts for the leading consumption of power semiconductors among other key regions. The region is also one of the leading exporters of power semiconductors in the world. The growth in the region is mainly attributed to China, which is the leading automotive and passenger vehicle market in the world. China is currently the leading consumer of power semiconductors. Furthermore, demand for power semiconductors is increasing from renewable energy sectors in the region.
Europe and North America are also leading consumers of power semiconductors among others in the global market.
Leading players in the global power semiconductor market include Infineon Technologies AG, Texas Instruments, ON Semiconductor, Fuji Electric Co. Ltd., ST Microelectronics N.V., Mitsubishi Electric Group, Semikron International GmbH, and Toshiba Corporation. While these companies are potential competitors, they are also potential licensees for our B-TRAN™ technology as there is not, to our knowledge, a high-efficiency bidirectional design available in the market. See “—Competition.”
There are a limited number of semiconductor fabrication development facilities in the United States and abroad. Furthermore, in 2021, 2022 and so far in 2023 there has been insufficient fabrication capacity for, and shortages of, certain semiconductor devices and related electronic components due both to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased demand, although this has not materially impacted us to date.

Our Technology
To further improve the performance of bidirectional technologies and products, we identified the need for a true bidirectional power switch and applied for and, in 2012, received a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (“ARPA-E”) to develop a bidirectional solid-state power switch. At the outset, our efforts under the ARPA-E grant were focused on the development of, including the manufacturing process development for, a bidirectional insulated gate bipolar transistor (“BD-IGBT”). Although work on BD-IGBTs had previously been done by others in research labs, it was a technology that had not yet been commercialized.
A bidirectional circuit incorporates multiple IGBTs, which are power switches used in the process to convert power from one current form to another. IGBTs switch current in only one direction and require the use of a blocking diode to prevent current from flowing back through the device. To enable a product to perform bidirectional power conversion, for each IGBT and diode used in a circuit, a second IGBT and diode must also be utilized. These additional components add voltage drops that affect the electrical efficiency of end-use products and generate heat that must be dissipated. To eliminate the need to utilize four devices to create one bidirectional switch and to improve the performance of bidirectional switching, a true bidirectional switch is necessary. While we initially focused on the development of a BD-IGBT under the ARPA-E grant, we shifted our focus under the grant to the development of a new, highly efficient power switch called a bidirectional bipolar junction transistor, or B-TRAN™, that we believe will allow product manufacturers to substitute one B-TRAN™ for two pairs of IGBTs and diodes used in bidirectional circuits in their products and, more importantly, be a potential replacement for conventional power switches, such as IGBTs, in the broader power semiconductor market. The B-TRAN™ leverages many of the same processing steps we had developed for the BD-IGBT while also providing certain key advantages including patentability, reduced component count and higher efficiency compared to a BD-IGBT.
Based on third-party device software simulations and prototype testing to date, we believe that the B-TRAN™ can significantly improve electrical efficiency in power converters and many other power conversion applications. Compared to conventional power switches, such as IGBTs, we believe the B-TRAN™ will reduce power losses by 50% or more depending on the application. The higher efficiency would substantially reduce the heat generated by the operation of products utilizing this technology. As a result, products incorporating B-TRANs™ would have lower thermal management requirements. This in turn would require significantly smaller surface area required for heat dissipation which would enable increased power density, or power per pound, and potentially result in smaller original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, products. In addition, B-TRAN™’s symmetric bidirectional operation reduces the number of components by 75% as compared to a conventional bidirectional switch utilizing IGBTs and diodes. This highly efficient and, we believe, unique symmetric operation will potentially provide a strong competitive advantage in bidirectional applications which are growing at rapid rates due to the electrification of transportation and the shift to renewable energy coupled with energy storage.
Our testing of B-TRAN™ silicon dies, prototypes and packaged devices to date is consistent with third-party simulations that predict significant performance and efficiency improvements over conventional power switches such as silicon-controlled rectifiers (“SCRs”), IGBTs and MOSFETs. We have also successfully confirmed the proof of concept of double-sided B-TRAN™ prototypes and packaged devices, validating the ability to make B-TRAN™ semiconductor power switches using conventional silicon semiconductor fabrication equipment and processes. Test results on the standard double-sided prototypes measured B-TRAN™ electrical losses at less than 50% that of conventional power switches such as silicon IGBTs.
As part of the B-TRAN™ development process and in partnership with our semiconductor fabrication partners, we continue with additional B-TRAN™ wafer runs, incorporating the results of prior runs and subsequent testing into the B-TRAN™ wafer fabrication. With the double-sided transistor behavior and low conduction losses measured and upgrades and improvements in the manufacturing process implemented, the next goal is to deliver packaged, prototype engineering samples for testing and evaluation by potential customers and partners. These samples will include a packaging design, incorporating input from a design for manufacturability review from a commercial packaging house. The samples will also include a second-generation prototype driver. Initial samples will be packaged B-TRAN™ dies with a driver and test boards in a safety enclosure. Feedback from potential customers in the test and evaluation program will be incorporated into future B-TRAN™ products.
The primary raw material used in the fabrication of B-TRAN™ devices is silicon wafers. Silicon is abundant and the production of silicon wafers is a large, global business with most manufacturers in Europe and Asia.

Business Strategy and Target Markets
Once we have delivered engineering sample kits to potential customers and partners for testing and evaluation for use in their applications, we intend to engage these potential customers and partners for B-TRAN™ utilizing a strategic partnership model.
Potential target markets for B-TRAN™ devices include, but are not limited to, electric and hybrid electric vehicles, electric vehicle charging, renewable energy and energy storage system power converters, uninterruptible power supplies (“UPS”) for data centers, industrial motor drives, solid-state circuit breakers, distribution and transmission switches and controls and other industrial and military markets. These markets typically utilize IGBTs for power switching in their applications. According to Mordor Intelligence, the IGBT market is already several billion dollars and is projected to be valued at $11 billion by 2026. We expect to initially target large and growing segments of the IGBT market, such as electric vehicles, electric vehicle charging, renewable energy, data center UPS systems and solid-state circuit breakers. We expect the B-TRAN™ to provide a competitive advantage in several IGBT markets due to its higher expected efficiency and inherent bidirectionality, the growth in bidirectional applications such as electric vehicles and energy storage, and as it seems the IGBT has almost reached its technological limit. We began to commercialize our B-TRAN™ technology in 2021 as we reached agreements with several potential customers and partners to participate in our B-TRAN™ test and evaluation program. See “Test and Evaluation Agreements” above. More recently, we entered into our first product development agreement and launched our first commercial product. See “Development Agreement” and “Product Launch” above.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, laws that protect intellectual property, confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions with our employees and others to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2022, we had 41 U.S. and 31 foreign issued patents as well as 24 additional pending U.S. and international patent applications on our B-TRAN™ technology. Our first B-TRAN™ patent issued in 2015 and our patents generally have a 20-year life from the date of initial filing prior to expiration. We expect to continue to build our patent estate for our B-TRAN™ technology and other technological developments that broaden the scope of our technology platform.
License Agreements
In 2015, we entered into licensing agreements which expire on February 7, 2033. Per the agreements, we have an exclusive royalty-free license associated with semiconductor power switches which enhances our intellectual property portfolio. The agreements include both fixed payments, all of which were paid prior to 2017, and ongoing variable payments. The variable payments are a function of the number of associated patent filings pending and patents issued under the agreements. We will pay $10,000 for each patent filing pending and $20,000 for each patent issued each year of the agreements, up to a maximum of $100,000 each year (i.e. five issued patents). All five patents associated with the agreements were issued.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the corresponding long-term liability for the estimated present value of future payments under the licensing agreements was $838,458 and $917,100, respectively.
Competition
We will compete against well-established incumbent power semiconductor device suppliers, including companies that already operate at a large scale in the single-sided (unidirectional) power switch market with IGBTs and MOSFETs, including silicon carbide MOSFETs. We expect that these power semiconductor device providers will base their products on current technologies serving the unidirectional power switch market, although we continue to monitor the competitive landscape for offerings or potential offerings based on new technologies. Many, if not all of our competitors, have greater financial resources, more comprehensive product offerings, broader market presence, longer standing relationships with business partners, longer operating histories, greater manufacturing capabilities, stronger brand recognition, and greater marketing resources than we have. To date, we are not aware of any offerings or potential offerings based on a true high efficiency bidirectional design other than potential products based on our B-TRAN™ technology.

Power semiconductor device providers typically compete based on voltage, current and frequency capabilities with the larger providers offering a broad range of standard products, including discrete devices and modules. Smaller providers generally take a niche approach focused on a unique or customized device capability. Customers for these devices are typically looking for demonstrable product or system level improvements in efficiency and/or power density for their applications. Power semiconductor device providers utilize direct and indirect sales teams focused on capturing customer design wins.
Government Approval and Regulation
Government approval is not required for us to license our B-TRAN™ technology or sell B-TRAN™ devices. However, government support for semiconductors and certain of our potential target markets including electric and hybrid electric vehicles, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, renewable energy, grid storage and improved grid resiliency may impact the size and growth rate of semiconductors and these potential target markets. There has been a trend in both the United States and abroad to support the adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy due to increased concern regarding the effects of climate change. For example, the Biden administration has announced several initiatives related to EVs. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will invest $7.5 billion to build a national network of 500,000 EV chargers so that charging EVs is predictable, reliable and accessible; more than $7 billion to ensure domestic manufacturers have the critical minerals and other components necessary to make batteries; and over $10 billion for clean transit and school buses. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act provides incentives for buyers of new and used EVs, credits to help manufacturers retool existing facilities and build new manufacturing in the United States, and grants to deploy zero emission heavy-duty vehicles. The CHIPS and Science Act will make critical investments in building domestic capacity for the semiconductors necessary for electric vehicles and will establish a technology, innovation, and partnerships directorate at the National Science Foundation to focus on fields like semiconductors and advanced computing, advanced communications technology, advanced energy technologies, quantum information technologies, and biotechnology. Government support for semiconductors and our potential target markets could have a material and positive impact on our business if our B-TRAN™ technology is successfully commercialized, particularly in these markets.
Employees
As of February 28, 2023, we had 8 full-time employees. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
