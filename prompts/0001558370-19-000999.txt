     ITEM 1. BUSINESS
     The Company
     Ingredion Incorporated (“Ingredion”) is a leading global ingredients solutions provider. We turn corn, tapioca, potatoes, grains, fruits, and vegetables into value-added ingredients and biomaterials for the food, beverage, paper and corrugating, brewing and other industries. Ingredion was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1997 and its common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “INGR”.
     For purposes of this report, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the “Company,” “Ingredion,” “we,” “us,” and “our” shall mean Ingredion Incorporated and its subsidiaries.
     We are principally engaged in the production and sale of starches and sweeteners for a wide range of industries, and are managed geographically on a regional basis. Our operations are classified into four reportable business segments: North America, South America, Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”). Our North America segment includes businesses in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Our South America segment includes businesses in Brazil, the Southern Cone of South America (which includes Argentina, Peru, Chile, and Uruguay), Colombia, and Ecuador. Our Asia Pacific segment includes businesses in South Korea, Thailand, China, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia, and India. Our EMEA segment includes businesses in Pakistan, Germany, the United Kingdom and South Africa.
     We supply a broad range of customers in many diverse industries around the world, including the food, beverage, brewing, paper and corrugating, pharmaceutical, textile, and personal care industries, as well as the global animal feed and corn oil markets.
     Our product lines include starches and sweeteners, animal feed products and edible corn oil. Our starch-based products include both food-grade and industrial starches, and biomaterials. Our sweetener products include glucose syrups, high maltose syrups, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, dextrose, polyols, maltodextrins, and glucose and syrup solids. Our products are derived primarily from the processing of corn and other starch-based materials, such as tapioca, potato, and rice.
     Our manufacturing process is based on a capital-intensive, two-step process that involves the wet-milling and processing of starch-based materials, primarily corn. During the front-end process, the starch-based materials are steeped in a water-based solution and separated into starch and co-products such as animal feed and corn oil. The starch is then either dried for sale or further processed to make starches, sweeteners and other ingredients that serve the particular needs of various industries.
     We believe our approach to production and service, which focuses on local management and production improvements of our worldwide operations, provides us with a unique understanding of the cultures and product requirements in each of the geographic markets in which we operate, bringing added value to our customers through innovative solutions. At the same time, we believe that our corporate functions allow us to identify synergies and maximize the benefits of our global presence.
     Geographic Scope and Operations
     Our North America segment consists of operations in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. The region’s facilities include 20 plants producing a wide range of starches, sweeteners, and fruit and vegetable concentrates.
     Our South America segment includes operations in Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador and the Southern Cone of South America. The segment includes nine plants that produce regular, modified, waxy, and tapioca starches, high fructose and high maltose syrups and syrup solids, dextrins and maltodextrins, dextrose, specialty starches, caramel color, sorbitol, and vegetable adhesives.

     Our Asia Pacific segment manufactures corn-based products in South Korea, China, and Australia. Also, we manufacture tapioca-based products in Thailand, from which we supply not only our Asia Pacific segment but the rest of our global network. The region’s facilities include ten plants that produce modified, specialty, regular, waxy, tapioca and rice starches, dextrins, glucose, high maltose syrup, dextrose, high fructose corn syrup, and caramel color.
     Our EMEA segment includes five plants that produce modified and specialty starches, glucose and dextrose in Pakistan, Germany, and the United Kingdom.
     Additionally, we utilize a network of tolling manufacturers in various regions in the production cycle of certain specialty starches. In general, these tolling manufacturers produce certain basic starches for us, and we in turn complete the manufacturing process of starches through our finishing channels.
     We utilize our global network of manufacturing facilities to support key global product lines.
     In general, demand for our products is balanced throughout the year. However, demand for sweeteners in South America is greater in the first and fourth quarters (its summer season) while demand for sweeteners in North America is greater in the second and third quarters. Due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends, we do not experience material seasonal fluctuations in our net sales on a consolidated basis.
     Products
     Our portfolio of products is generally classified into three categories: Starch Products, Sweetener Products, and Co-products and others. Within these categories, a portion of our products are considered Specialty Ingredients. We describe these three general product categories in more detail below, along with a broader discussion of specialty ingredients within the product portfolio. 
     Starch Products: Our starch products represented approximately 45 percent, 44 percent, and 46 percent of our net sales for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Starches are an important component in a wide range of processed foods, where they are used for adhesion, clouding, dusting, expansion, fat replacement, freshness, gelling, glazing, mouth feel, stabilization, and texture. Cornstarch is sold to cornstarch packers for sale to consumers. Starches are also used in paper production to create a smooth surface for printed communications and to improve strength in recycled papers. Specialty starches are used for enhanced drainage, fiber retention, oil and grease resistance, improved printability, and biochemical oxygen demand control. In the corrugating industry, starches and specialty starches are used to produce high quality adhesives for the production of shipping containers, display board, and other corrugated applications. The textile industry uses starches and specialty starches for sizing (abrasion resistance) to provide size and finishes for manufactured products. Industrial starches are used in the production of construction materials, textiles, adhesives, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, as well as in mining, water filtration, and oil and gas drilling. Specialty starches are used for biomaterial applications including biodegradable plastics, fabric softeners and detergents, hair and skin care applications, dusting powders for surgical gloves, and in the production of glass fiber and insulation.

     Sweetener Products: Our sweetener products represented approximately 36 percent of our net sales for 2018, and 37 percent our net sales for both 2017, and 2016.  Sweeteners include products such as glucose syrups, high maltose syrup, high fructose corn syrup, dextrose, polyols, maltrodextrin, glucose syrup solids, and non-GMO syrups. Our sweeteners are used in a wide variety of food and beverage products, such as baked goods, snack foods, canned fruits, condiments, candy and other sweets, dairy products, ice cream, jams and jellies, prepared mixes, table syrups, soft drinks, fruit-flavored drinks, beer, and many others. These sweetener products also offer functionality in addition to sweetness, such as texture, body and viscosity; help control freezing points, crystallization, and browning; add humectancy (ability to add moisture) and flavor; and act as binders. Our high maltose syrups speed the fermentation process, allowing brewers to increase capacity without adding capital. Dextrose has a wide range of applications in the food and confection industries, in solutions for intravenous (“IV”) and other pharmaceutical applications, and numerous industrial applications like wallboard, biodegradable surface agents, and moisture control agents. Our specialty sweeteners provide affordable, natural, reduced calorie and sugar-free solutions for our customers. 
     Co-products and others: Co-products and others accounted for approximately 19 percent of our net sales for both 2018 and 2017, and 17 percent of our net sales for 2016. Refined corn oil (from germ) is sold to packers of cooking oil and to producers of margarine, salad dressings, shortening, mayonnaise, and other foods. Corn gluten feed is sold as animal feed. Corn gluten meal is sold as high-protein feed for chickens, pet food, and aquaculture. Our other products include fruit and vegetable products, such as concentrates, purees, and essences, as well as pulse proteins and hydrocolloids systems and blends.
     Specialty Ingredients within the product portfolio: We consider certain of our products to be specialty ingredients. Specialty ingredients comprised approximately 29 percent of our net sales for 2018, up from 28 percent and 26 percent in 2017 and 2016, respectively. These ingredients deliver more functionality than our other products and add additional customer value. Our specialty ingredients are aligned with growing market and consumer trends such as health and wellness, clean-label, simple ingredients, affordability, indulgence, and sustainability. 
     We drive growth for our specialty ingredients portfolio by leveraging the following five growth platforms: Wholesome, Texture, Nutrition, Sweetness, and Beauty and Home.
     Wholesome: Clean and simple specialty ingredients that consumers can identify and trust. Products include Novation clean label functional starches, value-added pulse-based ingredients, and gluten free offerings. 
     Texture: Specialty ingredients that provide precise food texture solutions designed to optimize the consumer experience and build back texture. Include starch systems that replace more expensive ingredients and are designed to optimize customer formulation costs, texturizers that are designed to create rich, creamy mouth feel, and products that enhance texture in healthier offerings. 
     Nutrition: Specialty ingredients that provide nutritional carbohydrates with benefits of digestive health and energy management. Our fibers and complementary nutritional ingredients address the leading health and wellness concerns of consumers, including digestive health, infant nutrition, weight control, and energy management. 
     Sweetness: Specialty ingredients that provide affordable, natural, reduced-calorie and sugar-free solutions for our customers. We have a broad portfolio of nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners, including high potency sweeteners, and naturally based stevia sweeteners. 
     Beauty and Home: Nature-based materials that offer clean label ingredients for manufacturers to become more sustainable by replacing synthetic materials in personal care, home care, and other industrial segments.

 Each growth platform addresses multiple consumer trends. To demonstrate how we are positioned to address market trends and customer needs, we present our internal growth platforms externally as “Benefit Platforms.” Connecting our capabilities to key trends and customer challenges, these Benefit Platforms include products designed to provide: 
     Affordability: reduce formulating and production costs without compromising quality or consumer experience
     Clean & Simple: replace undesirable ingredients and simplify ingredient labels to give consumers the clean, simple, and authentic products they want
     Health & Nutrition: enhance nutrition benefits by fortifying or eliminating ingredients to address broad consumer health and wellness needs globally with specific solutions for all ages 
     Sensory Experience: deliver a fresh, distinctive, multi-sensory experience in the dimensions of texture, sweetness, and taste for food, beverage, and personal care products 
     Convenience & Performance: help create products for today’s on-the-go lifestyles and that meet user expectations the first time and every time, from start to finish
     At the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference on February 19, 2019, we announced a reorganization of our specialty growth platforms. We will be shifting our focus for value creation within our specialty products portfolio into the following five new growth platforms: Starch-based Texturizers, Clean and Simple Ingredients, Plant-based proteins, Sugar Reduction and Specialty Sweeteners, and Food Systems.  In addition to these five new growth platforms, we produce other specialty products primarily serving the industrial sector.
     Competition
     The starch and sweetener industry is highly competitive. Many of our products are viewed as basic ingredients that compete with virtually identical products and derivatives manufactured by other companies in the industry. The U.S. is a highly competitive market where there are other starch processors, several of which are divisions of larger enterprises. Some of these competitors, unlike us, have vertically integrated their starch processing and other operations. Competitors include ADM Corn Processing Division (“ADM,” a division of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company), Cargill, Inc. (“Cargill”), Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. (“Tate & Lyle”), and several others. Our operations in Mexico and Canada face competition from U.S. imports and local producers including ALMEX, a Mexican joint venture between ADM and Tate & Lyle. In South America, Cargill has starch processing operations in Brazil and Argentina. We also face competition from Roquette Frères S.A. (“Roquette”) primarily in our North America region.
     Many smaller local corn and tapioca refiners also operate in many of our markets. Competition within our markets is largely based on price, quality, and product availability.
     Several of our products also compete with products made from raw materials other than corn. High fructose corn syrup and monohydrate dextrose compete principally with cane and beet sugar products. Co-products such as corn oil and gluten meal compete with products of the corn dry milling industry and with soybean oil, soybean meal, and other products. Fluctuations in prices of these competing products may affect prices of, and profits derived from, our products.

      No customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales in 2018, 2017, or 2016.
     Raw Materials
     Corn (primarily yellow dent) is the primary basic raw material we use to produce starches and sweeteners. The supply of corn in the U.S. has been, and is anticipated to continue to be, adequate for our domestic needs. The price of corn, which is determined by reference to prices on the Chicago Board of Trade, fluctuates as a result of various factors including: farmers’ planting decisions, climate, domestic and foreign government policies (including those related to the production of ethanol), livestock feeding, shortages or surpluses of world grain supplies, and trade agreements. We use starch from potato processors as the primary raw material to manufacture ingredients derived from potato-based starches. We also use tapioca, gum, rice, and sugar as raw materials.
     Corn is also grown in other areas of the world, including China, Brazil, Europe, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, Canada, Pakistan, and Australia. Our subsidiaries outside the U.S. utilize both local supplies of corn and corn imported from other geographic areas, including the U.S. The supply of corn for these subsidiaries is also generally expected to be adequate for our needs. Corn prices for our non-U.S. affiliates generally fluctuate as a result of the same factors that affect U.S. corn prices.
     We also utilize specialty grains such as waxy and high amylose corn in our operations. In general, the planning cycle for our specialty grain sourcing begins three years in advance of the anticipated delivery of the specialty corn since the necessary seed must be grown in the season prior to grain contracting. In order to secure these specialty grains at the time of our anticipated needs, we contract with certain farmers to grow the specialty corn approximately two years in advance of delivery. These specialty grains have a higher cost due to their more limited supply and require longer planning cycles to mitigate the risk of supply shortages.
     Due to the competitive nature of our industry and the availability of substitute products not produced from corn, such as sugar from cane or beets, end-product prices may not necessarily fluctuate in a manner that correlates to raw material costs of corn.
     We follow a policy of hedging our exposure to commodity price fluctuations with commodities futures and options contracts primarily for certain of our North American corn purchases. We use derivative hedging contracts to protect the gross margin of our firm-priced business in North America. Other business may or may not be hedged at any given time based on management’s judgment as to the need to fix the costs of our raw materials to protect our profitability. Outside of North America, we generally enter into short-term commercial sales contracts and adjust our selling prices based upon the local raw material costs. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, in the section entitled “Commodity Costs” for additional information.

 Other raw materials used in our manufacturing processes include starch from potato processors as the primary raw material to manufacture ingredients derived from potato-based starches. In addition, we use tapioca, particularly in certain of our production processes in the Asia Pacific region. While the price of tapioca fluctuates from time-to-time as a result of growing conditions, the supply of tapioca has been, and is anticipated to continue to be, adequate for our production needs in the various markets in which we operate. In addition to corn, potato, and tapioca, we use pulses, gum, rice, and sugar as raw materials, among others.
     Research and Development
     We have a global network of more than 400 scientists working in 28 Ingredion Idea Labs® innovation centers with headquarters in Bridgewater, New Jersey. Activities at Bridgewater include plant science and physical, chemical and biochemical modifications to food formulations, food sensory evaluation, and development of non-food applications such as starch-based biopolymers. In addition, we have product application technology centers that direct our product development teams worldwide to create product application solutions to better serve the ingredient needs of our customers. Product development activity is focused on developing product applications for identified customer and market needs. Through this approach, we have developed value-added products for use by customers in various industries. We usually collaborate with customers to develop the desired product application either in the customers’ facilities, our technical service laboratories, or on a contract basis. These efforts are supported by our marketing, product technology, and technology support staff. R&D expense was approximately $46 million in 2018, $43 million in 2017, and $41 million in 2016.     Sales and Distribution
     Our salaried sales personnel, who are generally dedicated to customers in a geographic region, sell our products directly to manufacturers and distributors. In addition, we have staff that provide technical support to our sales personnel on an industry basis. We generally contract with trucking companies to deliver our bulk products to customer destinations. In North America, we generally use trucks to ship to nearby customers. For those customers located considerable distances from our plants, we use either rail or a combination of railcars and trucks to deliver our products. We generally lease railcars for terms of three to ten years.     Patents, Trademarks, and Technical License Agreements
     We own more than 750 patents and patents pending, which relate to a variety of products and processes, and a number of established trademarks under which we market our products. We also have the right to use other patents and trademarks pursuant to patent and trademark licenses. We do not believe that any individual patent or trademark is material to our business. There is no currently pending challenge to the use or registration of any of our patents or trademarks that would have a material adverse impact on us or our results of operations if decided against us.     Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 11,000 employees, of which approximately 2,600 were located in the U.S. Approximately 32 percent of U.S. and 37 percent of our non-U.S. employees are unionized.      Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
     As a manufacturer and marketer of food items and items for use in the pharmaceutical industry, our operations and the use of many of our products are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local statutes and regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act. We and many of our products are also subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Among other things, applicable regulations prescribe requirements and establish standards for product quality, purity, and labeling. Failure to comply with one or more regulatory requirements can result in a variety of sanctions, including monetary fines. No such fines of a material nature were imposed on us in 2018. We may also be required to comply with federal, state, foreign, and local laws regulating food handling and storage. We believe these laws and regulations have not negatively affected our competitive position.

     Our operations are also subject to various federal, state, foreign, and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air and water quality, and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. We operate industrial boilers that fire natural gas, coal, or biofuels to operate our manufacturing facilities and they, along with product dryers, are our primary source of greenhouse gas emissions. In Argentina, we are in discussions with local regulators associated with conducting studies of possible environmental remediation programs at our Chacabuco plant. We are unable to predict the outcome of these discussions; however, we do not believe that the ultimate cost of remediation will be material. Based on current laws and regulations and the enforcement and interpretations thereof, we do not expect that the costs of future environmental compliance will be a material expense, although there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance or that the costs of remaining in compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.
     During 2018, we spent approximately $12 million for environmental control and wastewater treatment equipment to be incorporated into existing facilities and in planned construction projects. We currently anticipate that we will invest approximately $10 million and $13 million for environmental facilities and programs in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
