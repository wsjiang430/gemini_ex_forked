ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General
We are a transportation and logistics company engaged primarily in transporting truckload shipments of general commodities in both interstate and intrastate commerce. We also provide logistics services through our Werner Logistics segment. We believe we are one of the largest truckload carriers in the United States (based on total operating revenues), and our headquarters are located in Omaha, Nebraska, near the geographic center of our truckload service area. We were founded in 1956 by Clarence L. Werner, who started the business with one truck at the age of 19 and serves as our Executive Chairman. We were incorporated in the State of Nebraska in September 1982 and completed our initial public offering in June 1986 with a fleet of 632 trucks as of February 1986. At the end of 2018, our Truckload Transportation Services (“Truckload”) segment had a fleet of 7,820 trucks, of which 7,240 were company-operated and 580 were owned and operated by independent contractors. Our Werner Logistics division operated an additional 40 intermodal drayage trucks at the end of 2018.
We have two reportable segments – Truckload and Werner Logistics. Our Truckload segment is comprised of Dedicated and One-Way Truckload. Dedicated provides truckload services dedicated to a specific customer, generally for a retail distribution center or manufacturing facility, utilizing either dry van or specialized trailers. One-Way Truckload includes the following operating fleets: (i) the medium-to-long-haul van (“Van”) fleet transports a variety of consumer nondurable products and other commodities in truckload quantities over irregular routes using dry van trailers, including Mexico cross-border routes; (ii) the expedited (“Expedited”) fleet provides time-sensitive truckload services utilizing driver teams; (iii) the regional short-haul (“Regional”) fleet provides comparable truckload van service within geographic regions across the United States; and (iv) the Temperature Controlled fleet provides truckload services for temperature sensitive products over irregular routes utilizing temperature-controlled trailers. Our Truckload fleets operate throughout the 48 contiguous U.S. states pursuant to operating authority, both common and contract, granted by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and pursuant to intrastate authority granted by various U.S. states. We also have authority to operate in several provinces of Canada and to provide through-trailer service into and out of Mexico. The principal types of freight we transport include retail store merchandise, consumer products, grocery products and manufactured products. We focus on transporting consumer nondurable products that generally ship more consistently throughout the year and whose volumes are generally more stable during a slowdown in the economy.
Our Werner Logistics segment is a non-asset-based transportation and logistics provider. Werner Logistics is comprised of the following five operating units that provide non-trucking services to our customers: (i) truck brokerage (“Brokerage”) uses contracted carriers to complete customer shipments; (ii) freight management (“Freight Management”) offers a full range of single-source logistics management services and solutions; (iii) the intermodal (“Intermodal”) unit offers rail transportation through alliances with rail and drayage providers as an alternative to truck transportation; (iv) Werner Global Logistics international (“WGL”) provides complete management of global shipments from origin to destination using a combination of air, ocean, truck and rail transportation modes; and (v) Werner Final Mile (“Final Mile”) offers home and business deliveries of large or heavy items using third-party agents with two associates operating a liftgate straight truck. Our Brokerage unit had transportation services contracts with 22,332 carriers as of December 31, 2018.
Marketing and Operations
Our business philosophy is to provide superior on-time customer service at a significant value for our customers. To accomplish this, we operate premium modern tractors and trailers. This equipment has fewer mechanical and maintenance issues and helps attract and retain experienced drivers. We continually develop our business processes and technology to improve customer service and driver retention. We focus on customers who value the broad geographic coverage, diversified truck and logistics services, equipment capacity, technology, customized services and flexibility available from a large, financially-stable transportation and logistics provider.
We operate in the truckload and logistics sectors of the transportation industry. Our Truckload segment provides specialized services to customers based on (i) each customer’s trailer needs (such as van and temperature-controlled trailers), (ii) geographic area (regional and medium-to-long-haul van, including transport throughout Mexico and Canada), (iii) time-sensitive shipments (expedited) or (iv) conversion of their private fleet to us (dedicated). In 2018, trucking revenues (net of fuel surcharge) and trucking fuel surcharge revenues accounted for 75% of total operating revenues, and non-trucking and other operating revenues (primarily 
1

Werner Logistics revenues) accounted for 25% of total operating revenues. Our Werner Logistics segment manages the transportation and logistics requirements for customers, providing customers with additional sources of truck capacity, alternative modes of transportation, a global delivery network and systems analysis to optimize transportation needs. Werner Logistics services include (i) truck brokerage, (ii) freight management, (iii) intermodal transport, (iv) international and (v) final mile. The Werner Logistics international services are provided through our domestic and global subsidiary companies and include (i) ocean, air and ground transportation services, (ii) door-to-door freight forwarding and (iii) customs brokerage. Most Werner Logistics international services are provided throughout North America and Asia with additional coverage throughout Australia, Europe, South America and Africa. Werner Logistics is a non-asset-based transportation and logistics provider that is highly dependent on qualified associates, information systems and the services of qualified third-party capacity providers. You can find the revenues generated by services that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues, consisting of Truckload and Werner Logistics, for the last three years under Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K.
We have a diversified freight base but are dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our freight. During 2018, our largest 5, 10, 25 and 50 customers comprised 32%, 45%, 60% and 74% of our revenues, respectively. No single customer generated more than 9% of our revenues in 2018. The industry groups of our top 50 customers are 52% retail and consumer products, 18% grocery products, 18% manufacturing/industrial and 12% logistics and other. Many of our One-Way Truckload customer contracts may be terminated upon 30 days’ notice, which is common in the truckload industry. Most of our Dedicated customer contracts are one to three years in length and may be terminated by either party upon 30 to 90 days’ notice following the expiration of the contract’s first year, and we generally review rates in these contracts annually.
All of our company and independent contractor tractors are equipped with communication devices. These devices enable us and our drivers to conduct two-way communication using standardized and freeform messages. This technology also allows us to plan and monitor shipment progress. We automatically monitor truck movement and obtain specific data on the location of all trucks in the fleet every 15 minutes. Using the real-time global positioning data obtained from the devices, we have advanced application systems to improve customer and driver service. Examples of such application systems include: (i) an electronic logging system which records and monitors drivers’ hours of service and integrates with our information systems to pre-plan driver shipment assignments based on real-time available driving hours; (ii) software that pre-plans shipments drivers can trade enroute to meet driver home-time needs without compromising on-time delivery schedules; and (iii) automated “possible late load” tracking that informs the operations department of trucks possibly operating behind schedule, allowing us to take preventive measures to avoid late deliveries. In 1998, we began a successful pilot program and subsequently became the first trucking company in the United States to receive an exemption from DOT to use a global positioning-based paperless log system as an alternative to the paper logbooks traditionally used by truck drivers to track their daily work activities. We have used electronic logging devices (“ELDs”) to monitor and enforce drivers’ hours of service since 1996.
Seasonality
In the trucking industry, revenues generally follow a seasonal pattern. Peak freight demand has historically occurred in the months of September, October and November. After the December holiday season and during the remaining winter months, our freight volumes are typically lower because some customers reduce shipment levels. Our operating expenses have historically been higher in the winter months due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency, increased cold weather-related maintenance costs of revenue equipment and increased insurance and claims costs attributed to adverse winter weather conditions. We attempt to minimize the impact of seasonality through our marketing program by seeking additional freight from certain customers during traditionally slower shipping periods and focusing on transporting consumer nondurable products. Revenue can also be affected by adverse weather conditions, holidays and the number of business days that occur during a given period because revenue is directly related to the available working days of shippers.
Employee Associates and Independent Contractors
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 9,616 drivers; 631 mechanics and maintenance associates for the trucking operation; 1,343 office associates for the trucking operation; and 1,262 associates for Werner Logistics, international, driving schools and other non-trucking operations. We also had 580 independent contractors who provide both a tractor and a driver or drivers. None of our U.S., Canadian or Chinese associates are represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we consider relations with our associates to be good.
We recognize that our professional driver workforce is one of our most valuable assets. Most of our professional drivers are compensated on a per-mile basis. For most company-employed drivers, the rate per mile generally increases with the drivers’ length of service. Professional drivers may earn additional compensation through incentive performance pay programs and for performing additional work associated with their job (such as loading and unloading freight and making extra stops and shorter mileage trips).

At times, there are driver shortages in the trucking industry. Availability of experienced drivers can be affected by (i) changes in the demographic composition of the workforce; (ii) alternative employment opportunities other than truck driving that become available in the economy; and (iii) individual drivers’ desire to be home more frequently. The driver market was increasingly challenging in 2018, and the supply of recent driver training school graduates continues to tighten. We believe that a declining number of, and increased competition for, driver training school graduates, an historically low national unemployment rate, aging truck driver demographics and increased truck safety regulations are tightening driver supply. We believe our strong mileage utilization, attractive and varied pay packages, financial strength, safety record, and new truck fleet are attractive to drivers when compared to many other carriers. Additionally, we believe our large percentage of driving jobs in shorter-haul operations (such as Dedicated and Regional) that allow drivers to return home more often is attractive to drivers.
We utilize recent driver training school graduates as a significant source of new drivers. These drivers have completed a training program at a driver training school, hold a commercial driver’s license (“CDL”) and are further trained by Werner-certified trainer drivers prior to that driver becoming a solo driver with their own truck. As mentioned above, the recruiting environment for recent driver training school graduates remained challenging in 2018. The availability of these drivers has been negatively impacted by the decreased availability of student loan financing for driver training schools. At the end of 2018, we owned two driver training schools that operate a total of 13 driver training locations to assist with the training and development of drivers for our company and the industry. 
As economic conditions improve, competition for experienced drivers and recent driver training school graduates may increase and could become more challenging in 2019. We cannot predict whether we will experience future shortages in the availability of experienced drivers or driver training school graduates. If such a shortage were to occur and additional driver pay rate increases became necessary to attract and retain experienced drivers or driver training school graduates, our results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that we could not obtain corresponding freight rate increases.
We also recognize that independent contractors complement our company-employed drivers. Independent contractors supply their own tractors and drivers and are responsible for their operating expenses. Independent contractors also provide us with another source of drivers to support our fleet. We intend to maintain our emphasis on independent contractor recruiting, in addition to company driver recruitment. We, along with others in the trucking industry, however, continue to experience independent contractor recruitment and retention difficulties that have persisted over the past several years. Challenging operating conditions, including inflationary cost increases that are the responsibility of independent contractors and a shortage of financing available to independent contractors for equipment purchases, continue to make it difficult to recruit and retain independent contractors. If a shortage of independent contractors occurs, additional increases in per-mile settlement rates (for independent contractors) and driver pay rates (for company drivers) may become necessary to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers. These increases could negatively affect our results of operations to the extent that we could not obtain corresponding freight rate increases.
Revenue Equipment
As of December 31, 2018, we operated 7,240 company tractors and 580 tractors owned by independent contractors in our Truckload segment. Our Werner Logistics segment operated an additional 40 company tractors at the end of 2018. The company tractors were primarily manufactured by Freightliner (a Daimler company), Peterbilt and Kenworth (both divisions of PACCAR) and International (a Navistar company). We adhere to a comprehensive maintenance program for both company tractors and trailers. We inspect independent contractor tractors prior to acceptance for compliance with Werner and DOT operational and safety requirements. We periodically inspect these tractors, in a manner similar to company tractor inspections, to monitor continued compliance. We also regulate the vehicle speed of company trucks to improve safety and fuel efficiency.
The average age of our company truck fleet was 1.8 years at December 31, 2018, compared to 1.9 years at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, the average age of our trailer fleet was 4.1 years, compared to 4.7 years at December 31, 2017. All of our trucks are equipped with satellite tracking devices. Approximately 98% of our company-owned trucks have collision mitigation safety systems, and 96% of our company-owned trucks have automatic manual transmissions.
We operated 25,255 company-owned trailers at December 31, 2018, comprised of dry vans, flatbeds, temperature-controlled, and other specialized trailers. Most of our trailers were manufactured by Wabash National Corporation. Nearly all of our dry van trailer fleet consisted of 53-foot composite (DuraPlate®) trailers, and we also provide other trailer lengths, such as 48-foot and 57-foot trailers, to meet the specialized needs of certain customers. Nearly 97% of our trailer fleet has satellite tracking.
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Werner Fleet Sales, sells our used trucks and trailers. Werner Fleet Sales has been in business since 1992 and operates in 9 locations. We may also trade used trucks to original equipment manufacturers when purchasing new trucks.

Fuel
In 2018, we purchased nearly all of our fuel from a predetermined network of fuel stops throughout the United States, of which approximately 95% was purchased from three large fuel stop chains. We negotiate discounted pricing based on historical purchase volumes with these fuel stop chains.
Shortages of fuel, increases in fuel prices and rationing of petroleum products can have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. Our customer fuel surcharge reimbursement programs generally enable us to recover from our customers a majority, but not all, of higher fuel prices compared to normalized average fuel prices. These fuel surcharges, which automatically adjust depending on the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) weekly retail on-highway diesel fuel prices, enable us to recoup much of the higher cost of fuel when prices increase and provide customers with the benefit of lower fuel costs when fuel prices decline. We do not generally recoup higher fuel costs for empty and out-of-route miles (which are not billable to customers) and truck idle time. We cannot predict whether fuel prices will increase or decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges will be collected from customers. As of December 31, 2018, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.
We maintain aboveground and underground fuel storage tanks at many of our terminals. Leakage or damage to these facilities could expose us to environmental clean-up costs. The tanks are routinely inspected to help prevent and detect such problems.
Regulations
We are regulated by the U.S. DOT, and certain areas of our business are subject to applicable federal, state and international laws and regulations. DOT generally governs matters such as safety requirements, registration to engage in motor carrier operations, drivers’ hours of service (“HOS”), and certain mergers, consolidations, and acquisitions. Werner maintains a satisfactory DOT safety rating, which is the highest available rating. A conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating could adversely impact Werner’s business, as some of our customer contracts require a satisfactory rating. Werner must also comply with federal, state, and international regulations which govern equipment weight and dimensions.
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s (“FMCSA”) Compliance, Safety, Accountability (“CSA”) safety initiative monitors the safety performance of motor carriers. In December 2010, FMCSA made public the Safety Measurement System (“SMS”), which includes monthly updates of specific safety rating measurement and percentile ranking scores for over 500,000 trucking companies. Through SMS, the public could access carrier scores for CSA’s Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (“BASICs”). The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (“FAST”) Act of 2015 directed FMCSA to remove from public view the information regarding carrier alerts and percentile ranks (i.e., scores). The FAST Act also instructed FMCSA to study the accuracy of CSA and SMS data and issue a corrective action plan. In January 2016, FMCSA proposed changes to the method for assigning a motor carrier’s Safety Fitness Determination (“SFD”) by using CSA data. FMCSA withdrew the SFD proposed rule on March 23, 2017, and the agency must receive the National Academies of Sciences (“NAS”) study before determining whether further rulemaking action of SFD is necessary. In June 2017, NAS issued its study with recommendations to FMCSA, which included adopting a new statistical model to measure motor carrier safety. On July 16, 2018, FMCSA published the “Corrective Action Plan Report to Congress” in response to the NAS recommendations and announced the withdrawal of the proposed enhancements to the SMS. Werner continues to monitor CSA related developments.
Interstate motor carriers are subject to FMCSA HOS regulations. FMCSA adopted a final rule in December 2011 that included provisions affecting restart periods, rest breaks, on-duty time, and penalties for violations. We began dispatching drivers under the revised HOS rules which became effective July 1, 2013. These rules were more restrictive and we believe adversely affected driver productivity. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 was passed by Congress with a provision to reduce the negative effects of the restricted hours and required an FMCSA study to demonstrate results with statistically significant improvements in safety, driver health, and other factors, before the agency could reinstate the restart rule restrictions that became effective in July 2013. Language included in the Fiscal Year 2017 Continuing Resolution allowed carriers to comply with the pre-July 2013 restart provision. In March 2017, FMCSA released the HOS Restart study report indicating the restrictions do not improve safety; as a result, the pre-July 2013 restart rule will remain in effect indefinitely.
Werner is the industry leader for ELDs to record driver hours and pioneered the Werner Paperless Logging System in 1996 that was subsequently approved for our use by FMCSA in 1998. In an effort to increase highway safety and improve compliance, Werner supported FMCSA’s ELD mandate. Legislative, regulatory, and legal efforts to delay the ELD final rule were unsuccessful and had minimal impact to the mandated implementation date. The final ELD rule was issued in December 2015, and on December 18, 2017, the final rule went into effect requiring all motor carriers to have certified ELDs that meet specific standards for documenting HOS. The out-of-service enforcement of ELDs began April 1, 2018.
FMCSA published a final rule that establishes the Commercial Driver’s License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse in December 2016, which requires motor carriers, designated service agents, medical review officers, and substance abuse professionals to 
4

submit records related to drug and alcohol tests to a nationwide database. Carriers and service agents are required to report test refusals and positive results as well as query the database prior to hiring an applicant. Compliance with the national drug and alcohol clearinghouse final rule is required starting in January 2020.
FMCSA issued its final rule for Entry-Level Driver Training (“ELDT”) in December 2016. The final rule requires that behind-the-wheel proficiency be determined by the instructor’s evaluation. Werner believes the rule succeeds in outlining a core curriculum that can lead to improved trucking safety for the industry and general public. The compliance date of the ELDT rule is February 7, 2020. We will continue to monitor the status of this rulemaking as it will directly impact our training schools and the hiring of professional drivers.
The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and DOT announced in August 2016 Phase 2 of the Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium and Heavy-Duty Trucks, which sets separate standards for both engines and vehicles. The final rule requires a reduction of up to 25 percent in carbon emissions and fuel savings from engines and vehicles over the next decade. New trailers purchased in 2027 will see up to an additional 9 percent in carbon reductions and fuel savings. On December 20, 2016, EPA issued a statement acknowledging the need to further reduce nitrogen oxide (“NOx”) emissions and the need to develop one NOx standard. In November 2018, EPA announced its intent for a future rulemaking to update standards for NOx emissions.
California’s ongoing emissions reduction goals have significantly impacted the industry. The California Air Resources Board regulations not only apply to California intrastate carriers, but also to carriers outside of California who own or dispatch equipment in the state. Werner continues undertaking strategies to structure our fleet plans to operate compliant equipment in California.
WGL, through its domestic and global subsidiary companies, holds a variety of licenses required to carry out its international services. These licenses permit WGL to provide services as a Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (“NVOCC”), customs broker, freight forwarder, indirect air carrier, accredited cargo agent, as well as to provide other services. These international services subject WGL to regulation by the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) and Customs and Borders Protection (“CBP”) agencies of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”), the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”), as well as similar regulatory agencies in foreign jurisdictions.
Our operations are subject to applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, many of which are implemented by the EPA and similar state regulatory agencies. These laws and regulations govern the management of hazardous wastes, discharge of pollutants into the air and surface and underground waters and disposal of certain substances. We do not believe that compliance with these regulations has a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position.
On November 30, 2018, President Trump, Prime Minister Trudeau, and then Mexican President Nieto signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”), which agreement would serve as a successor for the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”). The new agreement will need to be ratified by all three countries. We conduct a substantial amount of business in international freight shipments to and from the United States, Mexico, and Canada (see Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K). We believe we are one of the largest truckload carriers in terms of freight volume shipped to and from the United States, Mexico, and Canada.
In Canada on December 16, 2017, a notice was issued in the Canada Gazette proposing amendments to the Commercial Vehicle Drivers HOS Regulations mandating the use of ELDs. The proposal would be aligned with similar ELD requirements in the United States without introducing any impediments to trade. The newly proposed ELD regulations in Canada are not expected to have negative effects to our business model as Werner has used ELDs to record HOS since our Canadian operations started in 2000.
Werner is dedicated to participating in the development of meaningful public policy by continuing to evaluate local, state, and federal legislative and regulatory actions that impact our operations.
Competition
The freight transportation industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of trucking and non-asset-based logistics companies. We have a small share of the markets we target. Our Truckload segment competes primarily with other truckload carriers. Logistics companies, intermodal companies, railroads, less-than-truckload carriers and private carriers provide competition for both our Truckload and Werner Logistics segments. Our Werner Logistics segment also competes for the services of third-party capacity providers.
Competition for the freight we transport or manage is based primarily on service, efficiency, available capacity and, to some degree, on freight rates alone. We believe that few other truckload carriers have greater financial resources, own more equipment or carry a larger volume of freight than us. We believe we are one of the largest carriers in the truckload transportation industry based on total operating revenues.
