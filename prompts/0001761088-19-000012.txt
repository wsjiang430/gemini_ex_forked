ITEM 1.       BUSINESS
 
 Mascota  Resources Corp. (“we” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada on November 3, 2011.  

 
 In 2013 we acquired a 100% legal and beneficial ownership interest in a mining claim located in the Northeast Athabasca Basin, in the Province of Saskatchewan, Canada.  The legal and ownership rights on the claim were limited to the exploration and extraction of mineral deposits subject to applicable regulations.  The claim totaled roughly 2,014 acres or 3.15 square miles in size and was located approximately 25 miles north of the community of Points North, Saskatchewan.

 
 We were unable to raise the necessary funding to keep the mineral claim in good standing and in May of 2015, we forfeited our legal and beneficial ownership interest in the claim for non-payment. As of November 30, 2018, we no longer held a beneficial interest in the claim or any other mineral properties.

 
We plan to be a developer of residential properties in the Anchorage, Alaska metropolitan area.
 
We plan to develop a variety of residential properties, including single family homes, duplexes, triplexes, apartments and condominiums.  Initially, we do not expect the properties we develop to exceed the following parameters:
 
  Maximum                                   Maximum
 Type    Square Footage                             Sales Price                                              Other

THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION PROCESS
 
Residential construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality. A formal design team may be assembled to plan the building process. The design usually consists of drawings and specifications, normally prepared by a design team including an architect, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, and structural engineers. The design team is most commonly employed by the property owner. Under this system, once the design is completed by the design team, a number of construction companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work based on the design. Following evaluation of bids, the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder.
 
Construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems. Underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project. Cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labor and materials.  Having insufficient funds during various phases of construction can arise even when the overall total is enough.  Financial planning for the project is intended to ensure that a solid plan with adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place before the project is started and is required to ensure that the plan is properly executed over the life of the project.
 
Design and finance overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location of the building, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use. The financial structure must accommodate the need for building the design provided, and must pay the amounts required to construct the building.

Residential construction practices, technologies, and resources must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice.  A construction project must fit into the legal framework governing the property including regulations on the use of property. In construction, the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) is the governmental agency or sub-agency that regulates the construction process. In most cases, this is the municipality where the building is located.
 
Materials readily available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used (e.g. brick versus stone, versus timber). Cost of construction on a per-square foot basis for houses can vary dramatically based on site conditions, local regulations, economies of scale (custom designed homes are often more expensive to build) and the availability of skilled tradesmen.
 
Before the foundation can be dug, contractors are typically required to verify and have existing utility lines marked, either by the utilities themselves or through a company specializing in such services. This lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable facilities, which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations.
 
A residential building must also be in compliance with the local fire code, which is enforced by the local fire department or a municipal code enforcement office.
 
Changes made to a building that affect safety, including its use, expansion, structural integrity, and fire protection items, usually require approval of the AHJ.
 
During the construction of a building, the municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code. Once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed, an occupancy permit may be issued.
 
The most popular method of residential construction in North America is wood-framed construction. Typical construction steps for a single-family home or multi-family unit are:
 
 
· | Obtain an engineered soil test of lot where construction is planned
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop floor plans and obtain a materials list for estimations (more recently performed with estimating software) 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Obtain structural engineered plans for foundation (soil test report obtained earlier will be used by engineer to design foundation) and floor plan 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Obtain lot survey
--+------------------


· | Obtain government building approval if necessary
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | If required obtain approval from HOA (homeowners association) or ARC (architectural review committee)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Clear the building site (demolition of existing home if necessary)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Survey to stake out for the foundation
--+---------------------------------------


· | Excavate the foundation and dig footers (Scope of work is dependent of foundation designed by engineer)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pour a foundation and footers with concrete
--+--------------------------------------------


· | Build the main load-bearing structure out of thick pieces of wood and possibly metal I-beams for large spans with few supports 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Add floor and ceiling joists and install subfloor panels
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | Cover outer walls and roof in OSB or plywood and a water-resistive barrier
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Install roof shingles or other covering for flat roof
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | Cover the walls with siding, typically vinyl, wood, or brick veneer but possibly stone or other materials
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Install windows
--+----------------


· | Frame interior walls
--+---------------------


· | Add internal plumbing, HVAC, electrical, and natural gas utilities
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Install insulation and interior drywall panels (cement board for wet areas) and to complete walls and ceilings
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Install bathroom fixtures
--+--------------------------


· | Spackle, prime, and paint interior walls and ceilings
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | Additional tiling on top of cement board for wet areas, such as the bathroom and kitchen backsplash
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Installation of final floor covering, such as floor tile, carpet, or wood flooring
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Installation of major appliances
--+---------------------------------

THE ANCHORAGE HOUSING MARKET
 
The discussion below is based upon the 2018 Anchorage Housing Survey Report
 
For the past decade, Anchorage has experienced an increasing demand for housing and a market that has been unable to meet that demand. Seniors are expected to comprise 16.4% of Anchorage residents by 2030, and a growing millennial population are looking for affordable housing, in safe areas, with access to recreation. While the percentage of total income spent on housing has increased nationally, the percentage of average income spent on housing in Anchorage borders on what the Department of Housing and Urban Development describes as “cost burdened.” A shortened construction season and the cost of shipping building supplies make housing in Anchorage inherently expensive.
 
Most Anchorage residents said they were satisfied with their housing. A quarter of respondents thought their housing was in “excellent” condition while most thought their housing was “good and relatively updated” or “good but needed improvement,” and few said their housing was “poor and needed substantial improvement.” Only 10.6% of respondents were “somewhat dissatisfied” or “very dissatisfied” with their housing.
 
Among homeowners who were dissatisfied with their housing, half lived in single-family homes while a third lived in duplexes. Homeowners who were satisfied with their housing tended to live in single-family homes while only one-fifth lived in a multi-family building.
 

Overall, renters are younger than homeowners, have lower annual incomes, and were less likely to be married. Most renters have an annual pre-tax income less than $75,000 with only 6% claiming an income over $150,000 a year. Furthermore, only a quarter of renters were married, and most renters lived with roommates.
 
A smaller fraction of renters than homeowners said they lived in a safe neighborhood. Whereas only 60% of renters reported living in a safe neighborhood, three-quarters of homeowners believed they live in a safe neighborhood. Similarly, a smaller percentage of renters than homeowners described their housing as being close to “good schools.”
 
Renters are more likely to report proximity to parks and trails, and proximity to shopping, as current home features, indicating that rental housing is more likely to be built near these types of urban amenities. Nationally, renters tend to be younger and have less income, and are less likely to own a private vehicle. As developers and policymakers consider areas for rental property development, locating them near shopping, public transit and parks is likely to appeal to those interested in, or needing to, rent.  However, only a quarter of respondents said they would like to live in an apartment. These preferences align with national trends.
 
By 2040, Anchorage is forecast to grow by as many as 21,000 households, 45,000 people and 44,000 jobs. Mixed-use development projects offer a compact and efficient way to grow. They also offer a variety of benefits including another housing choice for residents and would-be residents, improvements in walkability between housing, workplaces, and other amenities, and stronger neighborhoods.
 
Mixed-use developments were common prior to the adoption of modern zoning codes. Separation of uses predominated in the mid- to late-20th century, where commercial development was concentrated in urban centers and residential development spread out into suburbs. Now, mixed-use forms of development are increasingly sought after by the marketplace, investors, and residents who want access to small-scale retail commercial development such as coffee shops, bakeries, local restaurants, and the like.
 
Between 2014 and 2018, home prices and rental prices in Anchorage changed little. Despite a recession in the city, driven by plummeting oil prices and declining state-level budget expenditure, the average home price actually increased, from $347,000 to $360,000 in four years. The median rental price, meanwhile, increased from $1,124 to $1,200 during that time.
 
New housing units are not coming on the market rapidly enough to meet consumer demand. Development has dropped from a recent high of 2,000 new units built in a single year in 2004, to an all-time low in 2016 of 340 new units built. In 2017, 460 new housing units were built: 196 single family homes, 104 duplex units, and 160 multi-family units.
 
Unsurprisingly, residents’ feelings about the cost of housing in Anchorage also changed little during this time. In 2014, of residents who tried to buy but couldn’t, 68% said that it was because housing was too expensive, compared to 69% in 2018. In 2014, 23% said they couldn’t afford a down payment, which increased to 25% in 2018. Only 10% said they had too much student loan debt to buy a house in 2014, which increased to 18% in 2018.

Responses were virtually unchanged to the question of what should be done to increase housing options in Anchorage. The top two selections in both surveys was build more affordable housing units, and redevelop deteriorated areas with new, denser housing. In 2014, the third most popular choice was to build more single family homes (36%), but in 2018 the third choice was to upgrade infrastructure to encourage redevelopment (43%).
 
Residents consistently say they want to see more affordable housing closer to urban amenities.
 
On November 20, 2017 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Great Northern Properties, Inc. ("GNP") for 250,000 shares of our restricted common stock valued at $5,000 ($0.02 per share), as well as promissory notes in the principal amount of $50,000, for total purchase price of $55,000.  The promissory notes bear interest at 6% per year and are due and payable on October 31, 2022 or the sale of this property in Anchorage, Alaska, whichever is the first to occur.  We plan to build a triplex with three condominium units, each of which will consist of approximately 1,650 sq. ft., on this property.  We estimate it will cost approximately $600,000 to build the triplex.  In August 2018 we applied for a construction permit and began soil testing for the project.  As of November 30, 2018, the Company's only asset was a parcel of undeveloped land in Anchorage, Alaska.
 Government Regulation
 
We are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements, the result of which is to limit the number of residential properties that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area.  Projects may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain areas due to government regulations.  
Competition
 
Competition in the residential property industry is intense, and there are relatively low barriers to entry into our business.  Builders compete for, among other things, buyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled labor.  We will compete for buyers primarily on the basis of a number of interrelated factors including design and location, price, buyer satisfaction, construction quality, reputation and the availability of mortgage financing.  Increased competition could hurt our business, as it could prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build residential properties or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion, and lead to pricing pressures on our residential properties.  Our competitors may independently construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products.  Furthermore, almost all of our competitors are significantly larger, have longer operating histories and have greater resources or lower cost of capital than ours; accordingly, they may be able to compete more effectively.  Most of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with subcontractors and suppliers.  We will also compete for sales with individual resales of existing residential properties and with available rental housing.
General
 
We do not have any employees, other than Mark Rodenbeck who serves as our only officer.   Mr. Rodenbeck does not receive any compensation for his services to us.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 7976 E. Phillips Circle, Centennial, CO 80112. Our main telephone number is (303) 961-7690.  We do not have a website at this time.
