Competitive Strengths
We achieve our strategic objectives by emphasizing a commitment to:
Sustaining our operational excellence and focus on cost management.

• | AAM received the 2017 and 2016 GM Supplier of the Year Award, which is awarded to suppliers that consistently exceed GM's expectations, create outstanding value or bring new innovations to GM.


• | We also received Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) Supplier Excellence award for AAM's contribution to their business, cost transformation and operational delivery during 2017.


• | During 2018, we launched more than 50 programs across our four business units, supporting a variety of customers including Ford, JLR and Mercedes-AMG. In 2019, we expect to launch approximately 50 new and replacement programs across our business units.


• | We continue to focus on cost management through the implementation of the AAM Operating System to improve quality, eliminate waste and reduce lead time and total costs globally.


• | We have established a cost competitive, operationally flexible global manufacturing, engineering and sourcing footprint to increase our presence in global growth markets, support global product development initiatives and establish regional cost competitiveness.


• | Our business is vertically integrated to reduce cost and mitigate risk in the supply chain. Our acquisitions of MPG and USM Mexico Manufacturing LLC (USM Mexico) in 2017 furthered our efforts to vertically integrate the supply chain and helped ensure continuity of supply for certain parts to our largest manufacturing facility.

Maintaining our high quality standards, which are the foundation of our product durability and reliability. 

• | In 2018, we had five facilities in the United States, one facility in China and one facility in South Korea awarded the GM Supplier Quality Excellence Award for outstanding quality performance during the 2017 performance year. For our Changshu Manufacturing Facility in China, it was the fourth consecutive year that they earned this award.


• | Our Fraser and Royal Oak, Michigan facilities were awarded the FCA Outstanding Quality Award in 2018 for the 2017 performance year.


• | Also in 2018, our Suzhou Manufacturing Facility in China was recognized with Ford's Q1 Award, which recognizes suppliers who consistently deliver exceptional quality and Chery International's 2017 Excellent Quality Performance Supplier Award.


• | Several other facilities were recognized for outstanding quality performance by OEMs such as Daimler, Honda and JLR.


• | AAM has an enhanced internal quality assurance system that drives continuous improvement to meet and exceed the growing expectations of our OEM customers.

Achieving technology leadership by delivering innovative products which improve the diversification of our product portfolio while increasing our total global served market.

• | In our Driveline segment, AAM's significant investment in research and development (R&D) has resulted in the development of advanced technology products designed to assist our customers in meeting the market demands for improved fuel efficiency; lower emissions; enhanced power density; advanced, sophisticated electronic controls; improved safety, ride and handling performance; and enhanced reliability and durability.


• | e-AAM was created to design and commercialize battery electric and hybrid driveline systems designed to improve fuel efficiency, reduce CO2 emissions and provide AWD capability. To date, e-AAM has 

3

secured two driveline systems contracts featuring patented e-AAM™ hybrid and electric driveline systems technology. One of these programs launched in 2018, and the other is expected to launch in 2020. 

• | AAM's EcoTrac® Disconnecting AWD system is a fuel-efficient driveline system that provides OEMs the option of an all-wheel-drive system that disconnects when not needed to improve fuel efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions compared to conventional AWD systems. In 2018, AAM launched the next generation of our EcoTrac® Disconnecting AWD system (EcoTrac® Gen II), which is smaller, lighter in weight and more efficient. This technology is featured on several significant global crossover platforms, including GM's Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain, FCA's AWD Jeep Cherokee and its derivatives, as well as the Cadillac XT4 and the Ford Edge. 


• | AAM has established a high-efficiency product portfolio that is designed to improve axle efficiency and fuel economy through innovative product design technologies. Our high-efficiency axles are featured on several premium OEM vehicles, including Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar Land Rover. As our customers focus on reducing weight through the use of aluminum and other lightweighting alternatives, AAM is well positioned to offer innovative, industry leading solutions. Our portfolio includes high-efficiency axles, aluminum axles and AWD applications for hybrid electric vehicles to full-electric vehicles. AAM's QuantumTM lightweight axle technology features a revolutionary design, which offers significant mass reduction and increased fuel economy and efficiency that is scalable across multiple applications without loss of performance or power. During 2018, AAM's QuantumTM lightweight axle technology received multiple awards, including the inaugural Future of Lightweighting Altair Enlighten Award and the inaugural Society of Automotive Analysts' Lightweighting Innovation Award. 


• | In our Powertrain segment, we have identified opportunities to apply our high strength connecting rod technology and refined vibration control systems to support hybrid powertrain systems and power dense four cylinder and three cylinder engines that are smaller in size. Also in our Powertrain segment, our Subiaco Manufacturing Facility has been recognized by the Metal Powder Industries Federation with a 2018 Powder Metallurgy Design Award of Distinction. 


• | In our Metal Forming segment, we have developed forged axle tubes, which deliver significant weight and cost reductions as compared to the traditional welded axle tubes. These forged axle tubes are expected to enter production on a program for a major OEM customer in 2019.


• | Our Casting segment has developed patented high strength ductile iron called Ductile - ITE™, which provides the potential to reduce mass by up to 20% while providing greater overall strength. Also in our Casting segment, we have identified an opportunity to begin utilizing three-dimensional printed sand cores in our production process, which has the potential to reduce costs and floor space requirements. 


• | AAM's Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC) at our Detroit campus, allows us to accelerate technological advancements. This state-of-the-art facility is our center for technology benchmarking, prototype development, advanced technology development, supplier collaboration, customer showcasing and associate training on our future products, processes, and systems. 

Diversification of Customer, Product and Geographic Sales Mix
Another element of building value for our key stakeholders is the diversification of our business through the growth of new and existing customer relationships and expansion of our product portfolio.

• | In addition to maintaining and building upon our longstanding relationships with GM and FCA, we are focused on generating profitable growth with new and existing global customers. New business launches in 2018 included key customers such as Ford, JLR and Mercedes-AMG. 


• | We are working on approximately $1.5 billion in quoted and emerging new business opportunities. These opportunities would allow us to continue the diversification and expansion of our customer base, product portfolio and global footprint. 


• | We continue to evaluate and consider strategic opportunities that will complement our core strengths and supplement our diversification strategies while providing future, profitable growth prospects. Our

4

acquisition of MPG in 2017 was a key step in achieving our goals of customer, product and geographic diversification.
We are focused on increasing our presence in global markets to support our customers' platforms.

• | As our customers design their products for global markets, they will continue to require global support from their suppliers. For this reason, it is critical that we maintain a global presence in these markets in order to remain competitive for new contracts. As a result of our acquisition of MPG, we have expanded our global presence, primarily in Asia and Europe. 


• | In 2018, we entered into a new joint venture (JV) with Liuzhou Wuling Automobile Industry Co., Ltd. (Liuzhou Wuling), a subsidiary of Guangxi Automotive Group Co., Ltd. This is in addition to our existing JV with Hefei Automobile Axle Co., Ltd. (HAAC), a subsidiary of the JAC Group (Anhui Jianghuai Automotive Group Co., Ltd.), which includes 100% of HAAC's light commercial axle business. Liuzhou Wuling manufactures independent rear axles and driveheads to be used on crossovers, including SUVs, minivans and multi-purposes vehicles and HAAC supplies front and rear beam axles to several leading Chinese light truck manufacturers, including JAC and Foton (Beiqi Foton Motor Co., Ltd.). These joint ventures continue to be a strong advantage for building relationships with leading Chinese manufacturers.

Competition

We compete with a variety of independent suppliers and distributors, as well as with the in-house operations of certain vertically integrated OEMs. Technology, design, quality and cost are the primary elements of competition in our industry segments. In addition to traditional competitors in the automotive sector, the trend towards advanced electronic integration has increased the level of new market entrants, including technology companies.
Industry Trends 
See Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis - Industry Trends.”

Productive Materials
We believe that we have adequate sources of supply of productive materials and components for our manufacturing needs.  Most raw materials (such as steel) and semi-processed or finished items are available within the geographical regions of our operating facilities from qualified sources in quantities sufficient for our needs.  We currently have contracts with our steel suppliers that ensure continuity of supply to our principal operating facilities.  We also have validation and testing capabilities that enable us to strategically qualify steel sources on a global basis. As we continue to expand our global manufacturing footprint, we may need to rely on suppliers in local markets that have not yet proven their ability to meet our requirements. 
Backlog
We typically enter into agreements to provide our products for the life of our customers' vehicle programs. Our new and incremental business includes awarded programs and incremental content and volume including customer requested engineering changes. Our backlog may be impacted by various assumptions, many of which are provided by our customers based on their long range production plans. These assumptions include future production volume estimates, changes in program launch timing and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. 
Our gross new and incremental business backlog is approximately $1.25 billion for programs launching from 2019 to 2021. In 2017, our gross new and incremental business backlog was approximately $1.5 billion for programs launching from 2018 to 2020. 
Of this $1.25 billion gross new and incremental business backlog, approximately 45% is for end-use markets outside of North America, approximately 70% relates to light trucks, including crossover vehicles and SUVs, and approximately 10% relates to our e-AAM™ hybrid and electric driveline systems technology. 
5

Patents and Trademarks
We maintain and have pending various U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and other rights to intellectual property relating to our business, which we believe are appropriate to protect our interest in existing products, new inventions, manufacturing processes and product developments. We do not believe that any single patent or trademark is material to our business, nor would expiration or invalidity of any patent or trademark have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability to compete.
Cyclicality and Seasonality
Our operations are cyclical because they are directly related to worldwide automotive production, which is itself cyclical and dependent on general economic conditions and other factors. Our business is moderately seasonal as our major OEM customers historically have an extended shutdown of operations (typically 1-2 weeks) in conjunction with their model year changeover and an approximate one-week shutdown in December. Our major OEM customers also occasionally have longer shutdowns of operations (up to 6 weeks) for program changeovers. Accordingly, our quarterly results may reflect these trends.
Litigation and Environmental Matters
We are involved in various legal proceedings incidental to our business. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws, regulations and ordinances, including those regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. We will continue to closely monitor our environmental conditions to ensure that we are in compliance with all laws, regulations and ordinances. We have made, and anticipate continuing to make, capital and other expenditures (including recurring administrative costs) to comply with environmental requirements. Such expenditures were not significant in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Associates
We employ over 25,000 associates on a global basis (including our joint venture affiliates) of which approximately 11,500 are employed in the U.S. and approximately 13,500 are employed at our foreign locations. Approximately 5,000 are salaried associates and approximately 20,000 are hourly associates. Of the 20,000 hourly associates, approximately 60% are covered under collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.
