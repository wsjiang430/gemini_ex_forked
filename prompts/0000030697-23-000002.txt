Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
Wendy’s is primarily engaged in the business of operating, developing and franchising a system of distinctive quick-service restaurants serving high quality food. Wendy’s opened its first restaurant in Columbus, Ohio in 1969. Today, Wendy’s is the second largest quick-service restaurant company in the hamburger sandwich segment in the United States (the “U.S.”) based on traffic share, and the third largest globally with 7,095 restaurants in the U.S. and 31 foreign countries and U.S. territories as of January 1, 2023.
At January 1, 2023, there were 5,994 Wendy’s restaurants in operation in the U.S. Of these restaurants, 403 were operated by the Company and 5,591 were operated by a total of 217 franchisees. In addition, at January 1, 2023, there were 1,101 Wendy’s restaurants in operation in 31 foreign countries and U.S. territories. Of the international restaurants, 1,089 were operated by 106 franchisees and 12 were operated by the Company in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”).
The Company’s principal executive offices are located at One Dave Thomas Blvd., Dublin, Ohio 43017, and its telephone number is (614) 764-3100.
Corporate History
The Wendy’s Company’s corporate predecessor was incorporated in Ohio in 1929 and was reincorporated in Delaware in June 1994. Effective September 29, 2008, in conjunction with the merger of Triarc Companies, Inc. and Wendy’s International, Inc., the Company’s corporate name was changed from Triarc Companies, Inc. to Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc. Effective July 5, 2011, in connection with the Company’s sale of Arby’s Restaurant Group, Inc., the Company’s corporate name was changed to The Wendy’s Company.
Fiscal Year
The Company’s fiscal reporting periods consist of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday closest to December 31 and are referred to herein as (1) “the year ended January 1, 2023” or “2022,” which consisted of 52 weeks, (2) “the year ended January 2, 2022” or “2021,” which consisted of 52 weeks, and (3) “the year ended January 3, 2021” or “2020,” which consisted of 53 weeks.
Business Strategy
Wendy’s long-term growth opportunities include delivering accelerated global growth through (1) driving strong same-restaurant sales momentum across all dayparts, (2) accelerating our implementation of consumer-facing digital platforms and technologies and (3) expanding the Company’s footprint through global restaurant expansion. Wendy’s vision is to become the world’s most thriving and beloved restaurant brand.
Business Segments
The Company is comprised of the following segments: (1) Wendy’s U.S., (2) Wendy’s International and (3) Global Real Estate & Development. Wendy’s U.S. includes the operation and franchising of Wendy’s restaurants in the U.S. and derives its revenues from sales at Company-operated restaurants and royalties, fees and advertising fund collections from franchised restaurants. Wendy’s International includes the operation and franchising of Wendy’s restaurants in countries and territories other than the U.S. and derives its revenues from sales at Company-operated restaurants and royalties, fees and advertising fund collections from franchised restaurants. Global Real Estate & Development includes real estate activity for owned sites and sites leased from third parties, which are leased and/or subleased to franchisees, and also includes our share of the income of our Canadian restaurant real estate joint venture (“TimWen”). In addition, Global Real Estate & Development earns fees from facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers (“Franchise Flips”) and providing other development-related services to franchisees. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 7 herein and Note 27 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for segment financial information.
The Wendy’s Restaurant System
The revenues from our restaurant business are derived from two principal sources: (1) sales at Company-operated restaurants and (2) franchise-related revenues, including royalties, national advertising funds contributions, rents and franchise fees received from Wendy’s franchised restaurants. Company-operated restaurants comprised approximately 5% of the total Wendy’s system as of January 1, 2023.
Restaurant Openings and Closings
During 2022, Wendy’s opened 14 new Company-operated restaurants and closed seven generally underperforming Company-operated restaurants. During 2022, Wendy’s franchisees opened 262 new restaurants and closed 123 generally underperforming restaurants.
The following table sets forth the number of Wendy’s restaurants in operation at the beginning and end of each fiscal year from 2020 to 2022:

 | 2022 | 2021 | | 2020
Restaurants open at beginning of period | 6,949 | | 6,828 | | 6,788
Restaurants opened during period | 276 | | 210 | | 147 
Restaurants closed during period | (130) | | (89) | | (107)
Restaurants open at end of period | 7,095 | | 6,949 | | 6,828

Restaurant Operations
Each Wendy’s restaurant offers an extensive menu specializing in hamburger sandwiches and featuring filet of chicken breast sandwiches, which are prepared to order with the customer’s choice of toppings and condiments. Wendy’s menu also includes chicken nuggets, chili, french fries, baked potatoes, freshly prepared salads, soft drinks, Frosty® desserts and kids’ meals. In addition, Wendy’s restaurants sell a variety of promotional products on a limited time basis. In March 2020, Wendy’s entered the breakfast daypart across the U.S. system and, in May 2022, launched breakfast in Canada. Wendy’s breakfast menu features a variety of breakfast sandwiches such as the Breakfast Baconator® and sides such as seasoned potatoes.
Free-standing Wendy’s restaurants generally include a pick-up window in addition to a dining room. In 2020, 2021 and 2022 pick-up window sales represented approximately 83%, 82% and 77% of sales at Company-operated restaurants, respectively.
Wendy’s strives to maintain quality and uniformity throughout all restaurants by publishing detailed specifications for food products, preparation and service, continual in-service training of employees, restaurant operational audits and field visits from Wendy’s supervisors. In the case of franchisees, field visits are made by Wendy’s personnel who review restaurant operations, including quality, service and cleanliness, and make recommendations to assist in compliance with Wendy’s specifications.
Supply Chain, Distribution and Purchasing
As of January 1, 2023, three independent processors (five total production facilities) supplied all of the beef used by Wendy’s restaurants in the U.S. In addition, seven independent processors (14 total production facilities) supplied all of the chicken used by Wendy’s restaurants in the U.S. In addition, there was one main in-line distributor of food, packaging and beverage products, excluding breads, that serviced approximately 67% of Wendy’s restaurants in the U.S. and four additional in-line distributors that, in the aggregate, serviced approximately 32% of Wendy’s restaurants in the U.S. Except as discussed below, Wendy’s and its franchisees have not experienced any material shortages of food, equipment, fixtures or other products that are necessary to maintain restaurant operations, and Wendy’s anticipates no such shortages of products and believes that alternate suppliers and distribution sources are available. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to interruptions in the delivery of beef and other products and, as a result, some menu items were occasionally in short supply at some Wendy’s system restaurants. While we and our supply chain partners effectively managed through this disruption, there can be no assurances that we will not see similar disruptions in the future. Suppliers and distributors to the Wendy’s system must comply with U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulations governing the manufacture, packaging, storage, distribution and sale of all food and packaging products.
Wendy’s has a purchasing co-op relationship structure with its franchisees that establishes Quality Supply Chain Co-op, Inc. (“QSCC”). QSCC manages, for the Wendy’s system in the U.S. and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, operating supplies and equipment under national agreements with pricing based upon total system volume. QSCC’s supply chain management facilitates the continuity of supply and provides consolidated purchasing efficiencies while monitoring and seeking to minimize possible obsolete inventory throughout the Wendy’s supply chain in the U.S. and Canada. Wendy’s and its franchisees pay sourcing fees to third-party vendors on certain products sourced by QSCC. Such sourcing fees are remitted by these vendors to QSCC and are the primary means of funding QSCC’s operations. Should QSCC’s sourcing fees exceed its expected needs, QSCC’s board of directors may return some or all of the excess to its members in the form of a patronage dividend.
Wendy’s does not sell food or restaurant supplies to its franchisees.
Quality Assurance
Wendy’s quality assurance program is designed to verify that the food products supplied to our restaurants are processed in a safe, sanitary environment and in compliance with our food safety and quality standards. Wendy’s quality assurance personnel regularly conduct sanitation and production audits for all of our core menu product processing facilities, which include beef, chicken, egg, pork, buns, french fries, Frosty® dessert ingredients and produce. Animal welfare audits are also conducted at all beef, chicken and pork facilities to confirm compliance with our required animal welfare and handling policies and procedures. In addition to our facility audit program, weekly samples of beef, chicken and other core menu products from our distribution centers are randomly sampled and analyzed by a third-party laboratory to test conformance to our quality specifications. Wendy’s representatives, including third-party auditors, regularly conduct evaluations and inspections of all Company-operated and franchised restaurants to test conformance to our sanitation, food safety and operational requirements. In addition, restaurant crew and managers at Company-operated and franchised restaurants are re-certified each year on critical food safety standards. Wendy’s has the right to terminate franchise agreements if franchisees fail to comply with quality standards.
Information Technology
Wendy’s relies on computer systems and information technology to conduct its business. Wendy’s utilizes both commercially available third-party software and proprietary software owned by the Company to run the point-of-sale and kitchen delivery functions and certain other consumer-facing and back-office functions in Wendy’s restaurants. Wendy’s has invested significant resources to focus on consumer-facing technology, including installing a single point-of-sale system for Wendy’s restaurants, activating mobile ordering via Wendy’s mobile apps, launching the Wendy’s Rewards loyalty program and establishing delivery arrangements with third-party vendors for Wendy’s U.S. and Canadian restaurants. We believe our digital platforms are critical to creating a more seamless user experience, providing insights to enhance our relationship with customers and meeting consumer demand for customization, speed and convenience. In December 2019, we implemented a plan to realign and reinvest resources in our IT organization to strengthen our ability to accelerate growth. We are partnering with a third-party global IT consultant on this new structure to leverage their global capabilities and enable a more seamless integration between our digital and corporate IT assets. In October 2021, we announced a partnership with a third-party global cloud provider with the intention to enhance our restaurant experience and unlock new customer, restaurant and employee experiences through data-driven insights.
Trademarks and Service Marks
Wendy’s or its subsidiaries have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in international jurisdictions, some of which include Wendy’s®, Quality Is Our Recipe® and the Wendy Cameo design. Wendy’s believes that these and other related marks are of material importance to its business. Domestic trademarks and service marks have their next required maintenance filings at various times from 2023 to 2033 in order to keep such registrations in force, while international trademarks and service marks have various durations of seven to 15 years. Wendy’s generally intends to maintain and renew its trademarks and service mark registrations in accordance with applicable deadlines.
Wendy’s entered into an Assignment of Rights Agreement with the Company’s founder, Dave Thomas, and his wife dated as of November 5, 2000 (the “Assignment”). Wendy’s had used Mr. Thomas, who was Senior Chairman of the Board until his death on January 8, 2002, as a spokesperson and focal point for its products and services for many years. With the efforts and attributes of Mr. Thomas, Wendy’s has, through its extensive investment in the advertising and promotional use of Mr. Thomas’ name, likeness, image, voice, caricature, endorsement rights and photographs (the “Thomas Persona”), made the Thomas Persona well known in the U.S. and throughout North America and a valuable asset for both Wendy’s and Mr. 
Thomas’ estate. Under the terms of the Assignment, Wendy’s acquired the entire right, title, interest and ownership in and to the Thomas Persona, including the sole and exclusive right to commercially use the Thomas Persona.
Research and Development
New product development is important to the Wendy’s system. The Company believes that the development and testing of new and improved products is critical to increasing sales, attracting new customers and differentiating the Wendy’s brand from competitors. The Company maintains a state-of-the-art research and development facility that includes a sensory lab, analytical labs, culinary kitchens and a Wendy’s test kitchen. The Company employs a variety of professionals from the culinary and food science disciplines to bring new and improved products to market.
Seasonality
Wendy’s restaurant operations are moderately seasonal. Wendy’s average restaurant sales are normally higher during the summer months than during the winter months. Because our business is moderately seasonal, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year.
Competition
Each Wendy’s restaurant is in competition with other food service operations within the same geographical area. The quick-service restaurant segment is highly competitive and includes well-established competitors. Wendy’s competes with other restaurant companies and food outlets, primarily through the quality, variety, convenience, price and value perception of food and beverage products offered. The number and location of restaurants, quality and speed of service, attractiveness of facilities, effectiveness of marketing and new product development by Wendy’s and its competitors are also important factors. The price charged for each menu item may vary from market to market (and within markets) depending on competitive pricing and the local cost structure. Wendy’s competes within the food service industry and the quick-service restaurant sector for customers as well as for personnel, suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees.
Wendy’s competitive position is differentiated by a focus on high quality, craveable food, its made-to-order square hamburgers using fresh, never frozen ground beef*, its unique and diverse menu, including chicken sandwiches, freshly-prepared salads and other signature items like chili, baked potatoes and the Frosty® dessert, its promotional products, its choice of toppings and condiments and the atmosphere and décor of its restaurants. (*Fresh beef available in the contiguous U.S., Alaska and Canada.) Wendy’s continues to implement its Image Activation program, which includes reimaging existing Wendy’s restaurants and building new Wendy’s restaurants with innovative exterior and interior restaurant designs, with plans for a significant number of new and reimaged restaurants in 2023 and beyond. The Image Activation program also differentiates the Company from its competitors by its emphasis on selection and performance of restaurant employees that provide friendly and engaged customer service in Wendy’s restaurants.
Many of the leading restaurant chains continue to focus on new restaurant development as one strategy to increase market share through increased consumer awareness and convenience. This results in increased competition for available development sites and higher development costs for those sites. Competitors also employ marketing strategies such as frequent use of price discounting, frequent promotions and heavy advertising expenditures. Continued price discounting, including the use of coupons and offers, in the quick-service restaurant industry and the emphasis on value menus could have an adverse impact on Wendy’s business.
Other restaurant chains have also competed by offering high quality sandwiches made with fresh ingredients and artisan breads, and there are several emerging restaurant chains featuring high quality food served at in-line locations. Several chains have also sought to compete by targeting certain consumer groups, such as capitalizing on trends toward certain types of diets or dietary preferences (e.g., plant-based food, alternative proteins, low carbohydrate, low trans-fat, gluten free or antibiotic free) by offering menu items that are promoted as being consistent with such diets.
Additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases come from operators outside the restaurant industry. A number of major grocery chains offer fresh deli sandwiches and fully prepared food and meals to go as part of their deli sections. Some of these chains also have in-store cafes with service counters and tables where consumers can order and consume a full menu of items prepared especially for that portion of the operation. Additionally, convenience stores and retail outlets at gas stations frequently offer a wide variety of sandwiches and other foods.
Wendy’s also competes with grocery chains, food delivery providers and other retail outlets that sell food to be prepared at home. Competition with these chains, providers and other outlets could increase based on the gap between the price of food prepared at home compared to the price of food purchased at restaurants.
Technology and delivery are becoming increasingly critical parts of the restaurant consumer experience. In the quick-service restaurant category, technology initiatives include mobile interactive technology for brand and menu search information, mobile ordering, mobile payment, mobile offers, mobile order pick-up and carryout, customer loyalty and rewards programs and other self-service technologies. An increasing number of restaurant chains have also introduced or expanded their restaurant delivery arrangements as another strategy to increase market share. If our technology initiatives, digital commerce platforms or third-party delivery providers do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security, speed, cost, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may be less inclined to use those platforms or providers and our competitive position could be adversely impacted.
System Optimization
The Company’s system optimization initiative included a shift from Company-operated restaurants to franchised restaurants over time, through acquisitions and dispositions, as well as by facilitating Franchise Flips. During 2016, the Company completed the sale of 310 Company-operated restaurants to franchisees, which resulted in the achievement of its plan to reduce its ongoing Company-operated restaurant ownership to approximately 5% of the total Wendy’s system.
While the Company has no plans to move its ownership away from approximately 5% of the Wendy’s system, it expects to continue to optimize the Wendy’s system by facilitating Franchise Flips, as well as evaluating strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees, to further strengthen the franchisee base, drive new restaurant development and accelerate adoption of Wendy’s Image Activation program. Wendy’s generally retains a right of first refusal in connection with any proposed sale or transfer of franchised restaurants.
The table below shows the number of restaurant acquisitions, restaurant dispositions and Franchise Flips completed in each of 2022, 2021 and 2020.

 | Year Ended

Franchising
As of January 1, 2023, 217 Wendy’s U.S. franchisees operated 5,591 franchised restaurants in 50 states and the District of Columbia, and 106 Wendy’s international franchisees operated 1,089 franchised restaurants in 31 foreign countries and U.S. territories.
U.S. Franchise Arrangements
The rights and obligations governing the majority of franchised restaurants operating in the U.S. are set forth in the Wendy’s current Unit Franchise Agreement (the “Current Franchise Agreement”) (non-traditional locations, including delivery kitchens, may operate under an amended agreement or alternate form of agreement). This agreement provides the franchisee the right to construct, own and operate a Wendy’s restaurant upon a site accepted by Wendy’s and to use the Wendy’s system in connection with the operation of the restaurant at that site. The Current Franchise Agreement provides for a 20-year term and a 10-year renewal subject to certain conditions. The initial term may be extended up to 25 years and the renewal extended up to 20 or 25 years for qualifying restaurants under the new restaurant development incentive and reimage programs described below in “Franchise Development and Other Relationships.” Wendy’s has in the past franchised under different agreements on a multi-unit basis; however, Wendy’s now grants new Wendy’s franchises on a unit-by-unit basis.
The Current Franchise Agreement requires that the franchisee pay a monthly royalty of 4.0% of sales, as defined in the agreement, from the operation of the restaurant. The agreement also typically requires that the franchisee pay Wendy’s an initial technical assistance fee. In the U.S., the standard technical assistance fee required under a newly executed Current Franchise Agreement is currently $50,000 for each new restaurant opened.
The technical assistance fee is used to defray some of the costs to Wendy’s for training, start-up and transitional services related to new and existing franchisees acquiring Company-operated restaurants and in the development and opening of new restaurants. In certain limited instances (such as a reduced franchise agreement term, development incentive programs or other unique circumstances), Wendy’s may charge a reduced technical assistance fee or may waive the technical assistance fee. Wendy’s does not select or employ personnel on behalf of franchisees.
International Franchise Arrangements
Wendy’s Restaurants of Canada Inc. (“WROC”), a 100% owned subsidiary of Wendy’s, holds master franchise rights for Canada. The rights and obligations governing the majority of franchised restaurants operating in Canada are set forth in a Single Unit Sub-Franchise Agreement (the “Single Unit Sub-Franchise Agreement”) (non-traditional locations, including delivery kitchens, may operate under an amended agreement or alternate form of agreement). This document provides the franchisee the right to construct, own and operate a Wendy’s restaurant upon a site accepted by WROC and to use the Wendy’s system in connection with the operation of the restaurant at that site. The Single Unit Sub-Franchise Agreement provides for a 20-year term and a ten-year renewal subject to certain conditions. The sub-franchisee pays to WROC a monthly royalty of 4.0% of sales, as defined in the agreement, from the operation of the restaurant. The agreement also typically requires that the franchisee pay WROC an initial technical assistance fee. The standard technical assistance fee is currently C$50,000 for each new restaurant opened.
Franchisees who wish to operate Wendy’s restaurants outside of the U.S. and Canada enter into franchise or license agreements with Wendy’s that generally provide franchise rights for each restaurant for an initial term of ten years or 20 years, depending on the country, and typically include a ten-year renewal provision, subject to certain conditions. The agreements grant a license to the franchisee to use the Wendy’s trademarks and know-how in the operation of a Wendy’s restaurant at a specified location. Generally, the franchisee pays Wendy’s an initial technical assistance fee or other per restaurant fee and monthly fees based on a percentage of gross monthly sales of each restaurant. In certain foreign markets, Wendy’s may grant the franchisee exclusivity to develop a territory in exchange for the franchisee undertaking to develop a specified number of new Wendy’s restaurants in the territory based on a negotiated schedule. In these instances, the franchisee generally pays Wendy’s an upfront development fee, annual development fees or a per restaurant development fee. In certain circumstances, Wendy’s may charge an upfront development fee for a non-exclusive territory, which is proportionate to a multi-unit development commitment. Wendy’s may also grant a franchisee the right to sub-franchise in a stated territory, subject to certain conditions.
Non-Traditional Development
Non-traditional locations, such as fuel and transportation centers, food courts and other retail locations, military bases and delivery kitchens, represent a component of Wendy’s development strategy. These non-traditional locations may be subject to different rights and obligations than our traditional franchise arrangements, including with respect to initial and renewal franchise terms, technical assistance fees, monthly royalty rates and advertising contribution rates, and the sales levels at these locations may also differ from sales levels at traditional Wendy’s restaurants.
Franchise Development and Other Relationships
In addition to its franchise and license agreements, Wendy’s also enters into development and/or relationship agreements with certain franchisees. The development agreement provides the franchisee with the right to develop a specified number of new Wendy’s restaurants using the Image Activation program design within a stated, non-exclusive territory for a specified period, subject to the franchisee meeting interim new restaurant development requirements. The relationship agreement addresses other aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship, such as restrictions on operating competing restaurants, participation in brand initiatives such as the Image Activation program, employment of approved operators, confidentiality and restrictions on engaging in sale/leaseback or debt refinancing transactions without Wendy’s prior consent.
To promote new restaurant development, Wendy’s has provided franchisees with certain incentive programs for qualifying new restaurants. In February 2023, Wendy’s announced a new restaurant development incentive program in the U.S. and 
Canada that provides for waivers of royalty, national advertising and technical assistance fees for up to the first three years of operation for qualifying new restaurants (“Pacesetter”). Wendy’s previously offered and will continue to offer a restaurant development incentive program that provides for reductions in royalty and national advertising fees for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants (“Groundbreaker”). Wendy’s U.S. and Canadian franchisees may elect either the Pacesetter program or the Groundbreaker program when committing to new multi-unit development agreements or adding incremental commitments to existing development agreements. Wendy’s also provides franchisees with the option of an early 20-year or 25-year renewal of their franchise agreement upon completion of reimaging utilizing certain approved Image Activation reimage designs.
Franchised restaurants are required to be operated under uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the selection, quality and preparation of menu items, signage, decor, equipment, uniforms, suppliers, maintenance and cleanliness of premises and customer service. Wendy’s monitors franchisee operations and inspects restaurants periodically to ensure that required practices and procedures are being followed. See “The Wendy’s Restaurant System—Quality Assurance” above for additional information.
See Note 7 and Note 22 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein, and the information under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” herein, for information regarding certain guarantee obligations, reserves, commitments and contingencies involving franchisees.
Advertising and Marketing
In the U.S. and Canada, Wendy’s advertises nationally through national advertising funds primarily on network and cable television programs, including nationally televised events, as well as through audio and digital media, and advertises locally primarily through regional network and cable television, audio and digital media and out-of-home media, such as billboards. Wendy’s maintains two national advertising funds established to collect and administer funds contributed for use in advertising through television, radio, the Internet and a variety of promotional campaigns, including through digital and social media platforms. Separate national advertising funds are administered for Wendy’s U.S. and Canadian restaurant locations. Contributions to the national advertising funds are required to be made by both Company-operated and franchised restaurants and are based on a percentage of restaurant sales. In addition to the contributions to the national advertising funds, Wendy’s requires additional contributions to be made for both Company-operated and franchised restaurants based on a percentage of restaurant sales for the purpose of local and regional advertising programs. Required franchisee contributions to the national advertising funds and for local and regional advertising programs are governed by the Current Franchise Agreement in the U.S. and by the Single Unit Sub-Franchise Agreement in Canada. Required contributions by Company-operated restaurants for advertising and promotional programs are at the same percentage of sales as franchised restaurants within the Wendy’s system. As of January 1, 2023, the contribution rate for U.S. restaurants was generally 3.5% of sales for national advertising and 0.5% of sales for local and regional advertising. As of January 1, 2023, the contribution rate for Canadian restaurants was generally 3.0% of sales for national advertising and 1.0% of sales for local and regional advertising, with the exception of Quebec, for which there is no national advertising contribution rate and the local and regional advertising contribution rate is 4.0% of sales. Non-traditional locations, including delivery kitchens, may be subject to adjusted requirements for national, local and regional advertising contributions. See Note 25 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding advertising.
Human Capital
At Wendy’s, our vision is to become the world’s most thriving and beloved restaurant brand, and every day we strive to live our purpose of creating joy and opportunity through food, family and community. Our restaurants, our food and the value and service we provide to our customers are all integral to our long-term success, but ultimately it is our people that help us deliver our brand promise of “Fast Food Done Right” every single day.
We continue to invest in employees to ensure we are able to attract, hire and retain great talent throughout our organization. We measure our effectiveness in these areas using various tools and metrics, including administering employee engagement surveys annually and tracking our employee turnover rates compared to others in the restaurant industry.
Employees
As of January 1, 2023, the Company was comprised of approximately 14,500 employees, of which approximately one-third were full-time, and two-thirds were part-time. The vast majority of our employees are located in the U.S. and work in our Company-operated restaurants within our Wendy’s U.S. business segment. Outside of our Company-operated restaurants, our 
largest population of employees work in our restaurant support organization, which includes employees across the globe and at our restaurant support center in Dublin, Ohio. We are proud to have a workforce with diverse backgrounds and experiences.
Respectful Workplace
From day one, the Wendy’s business has always been of, for and about people. Respect and fair treatment for our team members, franchisees, supplier partners and vendors are a central part of our business. So is staying true to the values established by our founder Dave Thomas more than 50 years ago, which include Doing the Right Thing, Treating People with Respect and Giving Something Back. Our commitment to these values is reflected in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to Company employees and directors, and in our Supplier Code of Conduct, which sets forth our expectations for key suppliers to the Wendy’s system in the U.S. and Canada. We strive to bring our values to life through daily interactions with our team members, franchisees and customers and in the communities where we do business. We expect our employees to maintain respectful workplaces that support and protect the integrity of the Wendy’s brand and fuel our continued success.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe our strategic focus on diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) has helped, and will continue to help, the Company remain true to our values as well as support our financial performance and global growth strategy. Creating and fostering inclusive work environments allows us to create an engaging and welcoming culture for our employees, which we believe positively affects the quality of products, service and experience we deliver to our customers. Through the leadership and support of our Office of DE&I, we continue to make meaningful progress against all of our goals, including increasing the diversity of representation among Company leadership and management and attracting new, diverse franchisees into our system.
We are fortunate to have several thriving Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), which are voluntary employee-led groups, each sponsored by a Wendy’s senior leadership team member. Our ERGs serve an important role in support of our DE&I strategy, creating forums for learning and inclusion, providing opportunities to celebrate different backgrounds, empowering employees to bring their authentic self to work, and creating leadership and professional development opportunities. Our ERGs focus on employees and allies who identify as Women (Women of Wendy’s), LGBTQ+ (WeQual), Military Veterans & Families (WeVets), Culturally Diverse (WCD), Black (WeBERG) and Young Professionals (WenGEN). In 2022, we added our newest ERG, GiveCare, with a focus on caretakers for children, siblings, parents, partners and other family members.
Compensation and Benefits
We are committed to providing market-competitive pay and benefits to attract and retain great talent. We enable this by benchmarking and analyzing pay and benefits both externally and internally. In addition to receiving competitive hourly rates and base salaries, all general managers and district managers of our Company-operated restaurants are eligible for performance-based cash incentive bonuses. Restaurant support service employees are also eligible to participate in a performance-based annual bonus plan. For our restaurant-level employees, we offer the potential for raises based on individual performance reviews throughout the year. At Wendy’s, we are committed to providing pay equity for all employees, regardless of gender or ethnicity.
We also offer a robust set of benefits to help eligible employees and their families stay healthy, manage spend related to health and financial well-being and effectively balance work and life. For our U.S. employees, this includes offerings such as insurance for medical, dental, vision and prescription drugs, telehealth access, 401(k) savings and retirement plans, health savings accounts, employee assistance program, paid sick leave, bonding leave and adoption assistance.
Safety and Well-Being
We are committed to providing our employees with safe and comfortable work environments and offering resources that our employees can use to help promote their well-being. We are extremely proud of the work our employees have done to support our restaurants, employees, customers and communities that we serve throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As the Company and our communities have transitioned from pandemic crisis intervention to ongoing prevention and protection, we remain committed to continuing to do our part to support the well-being of each other, our customers and our workplaces.
We remain focused on our high standards of quality and cleanliness at our restaurants through processes like reviewing cleaning procedures, maintaining an adequate supply of cleaning products and conducting our annual food safety recertification for our restaurant crew and managers. We also recognize that the well-being of our employees goes beyond work and our work environments. We offer several benefits to support the health and well-being of our employees, including our employee assistance program (EAP), available at no cost to all Company Employees and their household members, as well as other training and resources related to overall health and well-being.
Talent Development
To set our employees up for success and help them achieve their personal development needs and career growth, we invest in training and development programs at all levels within the Company. We also leverage annual processes that support individual performance planning, individual professional development planning and a broad review of talent development throughout the Company. Restaurant-level employees have the opportunity to take advantage of an extensive online learning curriculum, as well as hands-on training led by crew trainers, managers and field support staff. Restaurant managers and multi-unit operators participate in Wendy’s University, which includes targeted training to develop management and leadership skills. Wendy’s University also provides targeted programming for corporate management staff, including diversity training, people manager training, leadership dialogues and the opportunity to participate in third-party conferences and training. In 2022, we launched a new leadership development program (WeLead), facilitating a six-month program designed to build a performance-driven culture and develop talent across our organization.
Community-Based Giving
Wendy’s maintains a charitable giving program that supports four core categories: (1) foster care adoption; (2) hunger and food integrity; (3) youth and families; and (4) vibrant communities. In 2022, Wendy’s made charitable donations to a variety of organizations across the globe, highlighted by our continued support of the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, a charitable foundation created by our founder, Dave Thomas, which has been our signature charitable cause for more than 25 years. In addition to corporate contributions, we also host an employee-driven Community Giving Program, in which employees from across the Wendy’s system nominate worthy charitable organizations to receive charitable grants from The Wendy’s Foundation. We also made grants available to charitable organizations chosen by each of our ERGs in support of their missions.

Governmental Regulations
U.S. Operations
The Company and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the operation of our respective businesses, including laws and regulations relating to building and zoning, health, fire and safety, sanitation, food preparation, nutritional content and menu labeling, advertising, information security and privacy and consumer protection. Each Wendy’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located. The Company is also subject to federal, state and local laws governing labor and employment matters, including minimum wage requirements, overtime and other working conditions, family leave and health care mandates, union organizing, work authorization requirements, insurance and workers’ compensation rules and anti-discrimination and anti-harassment laws applicable to Company employees, and our franchisees are subject to labor and employment laws with respect to their employees. Additionally, the Company and our franchisees are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws that provide civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of public accommodations and other areas.
The Company’s franchising activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC requires that franchisors furnish a franchise disclosure document (“FDD”) containing certain information to prospective franchisees before the execution of a franchise agreement. Several states require registration and disclosure of the FDD in connection with franchise offers and sales and have laws regulating the franchisor-franchisee relationship. These state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions and the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or withhold consent to the 
renewal or transfer of franchise agreements. The Company believes that our FDD, together with applicable state versions or supplements, and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the FTC’s franchise rules and applicable state franchise laws.
International Operations
Internationally, the Company and our franchisees are subject to national, provincial and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those impacting us and our franchisees in the U.S., including laws and regulations concerning franchises, labor and employment, building and zoning, health, fire and safety, sanitation, food preparation, nutritional content, menu labeling, advertising, information security, privacy and consumer protection. Wendy’s restaurants outside the U.S. are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. The Company believes that our international franchise disclosure documents and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the laws of the applicable countries.
Environmental Matters
The Company’s operations, including the selection and development of properties that we own, lease and/or sublease to franchisees, and any construction or improvements made at those properties, are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations concerning the storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. Our properties are sometimes located in developed commercial or industrial areas and might previously have been occupied by more environmentally significant operations, such as gas stations. Environmental laws and regulations sometimes require owners or operators of contaminated property to remediate that property, regardless of fault, and could give rise to significant fines, penalties and liabilities, as well as third-party claims. The Company believes that our restaurant operations comply substantially with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Increased focus by governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives, particularly in the area of climate change. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. There is a possibility that government initiatives, or actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns, climate change or scarcity of energy and water resources, could have a direct impact on our business in ways that we cannot predict at this time.
Legal Matters
The Company is involved in litigation and claims incidental to our business. We provide accruals for such litigation and claims when we determine it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. We believe we have adequate accruals for all of our legal and environmental matters. See Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for additional information.
The Company does not believe that compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, or the outcome of any legal matters in which we are involved, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, the Company cannot predict what laws or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or whether any legal matters in which we are involved could result in greater liabilities than we currently anticipate. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain risks relating to legal and regulatory requirements, litigation and claims and related matters affecting our business.
