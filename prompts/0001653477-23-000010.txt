Governmental Regulations
Our manufacturing operations are subject to regulation by governmental and other regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our operations. These regulations include the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling, storage, transportation, disposal, and clean-up of chemicals and waste materials, and otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, as well as other operational regulations, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and the Toxic 
Substances Control Act ("TSCA") in the U.S. and the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals ("REACH"), directives in the European Union, the United Kingdom ("UK"), and other countries. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the material effects that compliance with these regulations may have upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of Ingevity, but we currently anticipate that such compliance will not have a material adverse effect on any of the foregoing. Environmental and other regulations and related legal proceedings have the potential to involve significant costs and liability for Ingevity.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property, including patents, closely guarded trade secrets, and highly proprietary manufacturing know-how, as well as other proprietary rights, is a critical part of maintaining our technology leadership and competitive edge. Our business strategy includes filing patent and trademark applications where appropriate for proprietary developments, as well as protecting our trade secrets. We actively create, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights. We are filing for and being granted patents for product and process developments for our Performance Materials business that we believe are both novel and consistent with trends in the technological development of engines. Our Evotherm® Warm Mix Asphalt technology is supported by numerous global patents. Additionally, our caprolactone and related technologies are supported by numerous global patents and trademarks, as well as proprietary manufacturing and technical know-how. The protection afforded by our patents and trademarks varies based on country, scope, and coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies. Although our intellectual property taken as a whole is material to the business, there is no individual patent or trademark the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on the business. 
On July 19, 2018, Ingevity filed suit against BASF Corporation (“BASF”) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the “Delaware Proceeding”) alleging BASF infringed Ingevity’s patent covering canister systems used in the control of automotive gasoline vapor emissions (U.S. Patent No. RE38,844) (the “844 Patent”). On February 14, 2019, BASF asserted counterclaims against Ingevity in the Delaware Proceeding, alleging two claims for violations of U.S. antitrust law (one for exclusive dealing and the other for tying) as well as a claim for tortious interference with an alleged prospective business relationship between BASF and a BASF customer (the “BASF Counterclaims”). The BASF Counterclaims relate to Ingevity’s enforcement of the 844 Patent and Ingevity’s entry into several supply agreements with customers of its fuel vapor canister honeycombs. The U.S. District Court dismissed Ingevity’s patent infringement claims on November 18, 2020, and the case proceeded to trial on the BASF Counterclaims in September 2021.
On September 15, 2021, a jury in the Delaware Proceeding issued a verdict in favor of BASF on the BASF Counterclaims and awarded BASF damages of approximately $28.3 million, which will be trebled under U.S. antitrust law to approximately $85.0 million when the court enters judgment. In addition, BASF may seek pre- and post-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees and costs in amounts that they will have to support at a future date.
We disagree with the verdict, including the court’s application of the law, and we intend to seek judgment as a matter of law in the Delaware Proceeding post-trial briefing stage and on appeal, if necessary. In addition, we intend to challenge the U.S. District Court’s November 2020 dismissal of our patent infringement claims against BASF. Ingevity believes in the strength of its intellectual property and the merits of its position and intends to pursue all legal relief available to challenge these outcomes in the Delaware Proceeding. The final resolution of these matters could take up to eighteen months.
Seasonality
There are a variety of seasonal dynamics, including global climate and weather conditions, that impact our businesses, though none have currently materially affected our financial results, except in the case of the pavement technologies product line, where roughly 70 to 75 percent of revenue is generated between April and September. From a supply perspective, this seasonality is effectively managed through pre-season inventory build and active inventory management throughout the year.
Energy
Our manufacturing processes require a significant amount of energy. We are dependent on natural gas to fuel the processes in our chemical refineries and activated carbon plants. Although we believe that we currently have a stable natural gas supply and infrastructure for our operations, we are subject to volatility in the market price of natural gas. We enter into certain derivative financial instruments to mitigate expected fluctuations in market prices and the volatility of earnings and cash flow resulting from changes to the pricing of natural gas purchases. All of our manufacturing processes also consume a 
significant amount of electricity. Each of these facilities are located in regulated service areas that have stable rate structures with reliable electricity supply. 
Leveraging Sustainability
Throughout our Performance Chemicals and Performance Materials portfolios, we are a leader in adding value to products made from renewable materials and in derivatizing technologies that impart desirable environmental benefits in their use. To create a majority of our chemistries, we take crude tall oil from pine trees, hardwood sawdust (both co-products of the lumber, paper, and furniture-making industries), and vegetable oils and convert them into products that benefit customers, the environment, and society.
For the caprolactone-based products in our Performance Chemicals segment – although derived from traditional feedstocks – these solutions enable performance attributes in end-use markets that directly help customers and consumers meet sustainability goals. The superior durability of capa-based polyurethane technologies extends product life and the biodegradable performance of our thermoplastic polycaprolactones offers compostable end of-life solutions.
Put simply: Ingevity’s products help customers reduce their ecological impact. Our asphalt emulsifiers enable pavement recycling that reuses up to 100 percent of existing materials to create longer-lasting roads. Our automotive activated carbon products improve the air we breathe by recovering 8 million gallons of gasoline daily. Our lubricant technologies increase tool life and simplify formulations. And our alternative-fuel vehicle technology enables the use of renewable natural gas as fuel for pickup trucks and busses.
Our business is built on our ability to maximize the value and utility of materials over their lifecycle, and we will continue to enhance this value proposition through future acquisitions and new product development.
Human Capital Management
Talent
Our employees are critical to our success, and we strive to provide a safe, rewarding, and respectful workplace where our people are provided with opportunities to pursue career paths based on skills, performance, and potential. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, retain and motivate critical resources across production, technical, engineering, sales, and various functional disciplines. If an ongoing failure to attract and retain individuals in key business roles and functions materialized, it could adversely affect our financial condition and operational results.
We currently employ approximately 2,050 employees, of whom approximately 77 percent are employed in the U.S. Approximately 19 percent of our employees are represented by domestic (i.e., U.S.) labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements ("CBA"). We engage in negotiations with labor unions for new CBAs from time to time based on expiration dates of agreements and statutory requirements. We consider our relationships with all salaried, union-hourly, and non-hourly employees to be positive and collaborative.
During the second quarter of 2022, at our Covington, Virginia Performance Materials' facility, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”) AFL-CIO Local Union 464 ratified a four-year CBA, which expires January 15, 2025. In the third quarter of 2022, at our Covington Virginia Performance Materials' facility, the Covington Paper Workers Union, Local 675, affiliated with the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers ratified a four-year CBA which expires December 1, 2025. In the fourth quarter of 2022, at our Charleston South Carolina Performance Chemicals’ facility: (1) the United Steel, Paper, Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (“USW”) on behalf of its Local Union 9-0508-02, ratified a four-year CBA, which expires June 30, 2026, and (2) the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (“IAM”) and its Charleston Lodge No. 183, ratified a four-year CBA, which expires June 30, 2026. In addition, the CBA at our Wickliffe, Kentucky Performance Materials facility with the USW, on behalf of its affiliated Local Union 0775, expired on February 1, 2023. The parties began contract renewal negotiations in January 2023. 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
At Ingevity, we are committed to fostering a culture where we recognize, celebrate, and welcome the ways in which each other's unique backgrounds, experiences and perspectives help us reach the best solutions for our customers. To support us in developing practical and thoughtful ways to embed these principles into our everyday work, we created a dedicated team to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion ("DEI"). 
A strategic and intentional focus on DEI enhances the employee experience and satisfaction. It also supports more effective innovation, enhanced customer experience, and a deeper understanding of the communities Ingevity serves. Our diversity recruiting strategy is focused on ensuring everyone has an equitable experience by diversifying our talent pipeline through diverse candidate slates and interview teams as well as gender-neutral job descriptions. We are also enhancing our partnerships with organizations such as the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), National Black MBA Association, Society of Women Engineers (SWE), Society of Hispanic Engineers (SHPE), Society of Asian Scientist and Engineers (SASE), Corporate Gray, an organization that focuses on military recruiting, and historically black colleges and universities to broaden our candidate pool.
Our focus on advancing the diversity makeup of our leadership continues to positively impact our growth and success. Today, our board of directors is 30 percent women and 20 percent racially and ethnically diverse, and our executive team is 38 percent women-led and 13 percent racially and ethnically diverse. Our Women’s Network employee resource group ("ERG") has served many years as a catalyst for building community, supporting personal and professional development, and strengthening our business impact internally and externally. We also recently launched two new ERGs in support of our Black and Hispanic employees. ERGs aim to foster a richer and more diverse workplace by promoting a positive and inclusive employee experience.
Performance Management
We evaluate employee performance holistically, looking at the progress against goals, behaviors, feedback, and direct contributions of the employee and their level of impact on the business. Performance measurement includes accomplishments that supported the team, our company, internal and external customers, and our core values. In 2022, we modified our approach to create a more formalized record of employee performance at mid-year and year-end, including a new requirement for everyone at Ingevity to request feedback from colleagues who have insight into the respective employee's performance and contributions. We have a structured performance assessment review at least twice a year and continued to promote ongoing conversations between managers and employees to improve performance, drive business results, and increase employee engagement. Performance conversations often occur monthly or more frequently. The slight process enhancements allow Ingevity to cultivate a well-rounded view of each employee's strengths and identify opportunities for learning and growth.
Health & Safety
Ingevity has a world-class safety program and a strong safety culture. Personal, process, and public safety are core values at Ingevity. We work hard to protect employees, contractors, and the communities where we operate from injuries, illnesses and incidents through the design and delivery of safe operations, continuous improvement of personal and process safety performance, management systems, and programs, a strong culture of compliance, and a commitment to zero harm to people and the environment.
In 2022, we continued our efforts to increase reporting of and response to near miss incidents to prevent more serious injuries before they could occur. This included efforts to increase the number of near misses reported and an increase in reporting by a broader number of employees. We also continued to improve safety training, further expanded the use of leading indicators to ensure effective initiatives are proactively implemented, and improved incident investigation quality to ensure contributing factors are appropriately identified and addressed. Employees were trained on the importance of our Life-Saving Rules, put in place to prevent fatalities and serious injuries through leadership videos, monthly interactive training packages, and upgraded procedures, checklists, work permits, and audits. Additionally, in North America where the majority of our bulk shipments are executed, we abide by the American Chemistry Council’s Responsible Care practices of transporting our chemicals safely. We strategically utilize logistics providers that have committed to these higher standards of Safety, Security, Stewardship, and the Environment. 
Segments
Performance Materials
We engineer, manufacture, and sell hardwood-based, chemically activated carbon products, which are produced through a highly technical and specialized process primarily for use in gasoline vapor emission control systems in cars, trucks, motorcycles, and boats. To maximize the productivity of our manufacturing assets, we also produce several other activated carbon products for food, water, beverage, and chemical purification applications.
Our automotive activated carbon products primarily take the form of granules, pellets, and honeycomb "scrubbers," which are primarily utilized in vehicle-based gasoline vapor emission control systems to capture gasoline vapors that would 
otherwise be released into the atmosphere as volatile organic compounds. The captured gasoline vapors are largely purged from the activated carbon and re-directed to the engine where they are used as supplemental power for the vehicle. In this way, our automotive activated carbon products are part of a system that improves the environment and fuel efficiency. Performance Materials' net sales for 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $548.5 million, $516.8 million, and $510.0 million, respectively. The chart below reflects our 2022 Performance Materials' net sales by geography. Sales are assigned to geographic areas based on the location of the party to which the product was shipped.
Raw Materials and Production
Our Performance Materials segment serves customers globally from three manufacturing locations in the U.S. and two in China. The primary raw material (by volume) used in the manufacture of our activated carbon is hardwood sawdust. Sawdust is readily available and is sourced through multiple suppliers to protect against supply disruptions and to maintain competitive pricing.
We also utilize phosphoric acid, which is used to chemically activate the hardwood sawdust. This phosphoric acid is sourced through multiple suppliers to protect against supply disruptions and to maintain competitive pricing. The market price of phosphoric acid is affected by the global agriculture market as the majority of global phosphate rock production is used for fertilizer production and only a portion of that production is used to manufacture purified phosphoric acid.
Customers
We sell our automotive technologies products to approximately 80 customers around the globe. In 2022, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 89 percent of sales. We are the trusted source of these products for many of the world’s largest automotive parts manufacturers, including BorgWarner Inc. (previously Delphi Technologies PLC), A. Kayser Automotive System GmbH, Korea Fuel-Tech Corporation, MAHLE GmbH, and many other large and small component manufacturers throughout the global automotive supply chain. Our process purification products are sold to approximately 60 customers globally. We sell our automotive technologies and process purification products primarily through our own direct sales force in North America, Europe, South America, Asia, and a smaller, focused network of third-party distributors that have established a strong direct sales and marketing presence in North America and China.
Competition
Our competitors include Norit, Kuraray Co., Ltd., and several domestic U.S. manufacturers and distributors of imported products and Chinese manufacturers. Ingevity has a decades-long track record of providing activated carbon that achieves life-of-vehicle emission standards. Given the imperative for automotive manufacturers to produce vehicles for the U.S., Canada, and China markets capable of meeting life-of-vehicle emission standards, or potentially face expensive recalls and unfavorable publicity, our automotive activated carbon products provide our customers the low-risk choice for this high-performance application. Additionally, we are well-positioned to meet increasing emissions standards around the world.
Performance Chemicals
Ingevity’s Performance Chemicals segment is comprised of three product lines: pavement technologies, industrial specialties, and engineered polymers. Our products are utilized in warm mix paving, pavement preservation, pavement reconstruction and recycling, road striping, adhesives, agrochemical dispersants, lubricants, printing inks, coatings, resins, elastomers, bioplastics, medical devices, oil well service additives, oil production and downstream applications, and other diverse industrial uses. Our application expertise is often called upon by our customers to provide unique solutions that maximize resource efficiency. We have a broad and diverse customer base in this segment. In 2022, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 23 percent of our segment revenue, with the next 100 customers making up approximately 49 percent of our segment revenue. Performance Chemicals' net sales for 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $1,119.8 million, $874.7 million, and $706.1 million, respectively. The chart below reflects our 2022 Performance Chemicals' net sales by geography. Sales are assigned to geographic areas based on the location of the party to which the product was shipped.
Raw Materials and Production
Our Performance Chemicals segment serves customers globally from seven manufacturing locations in the U.S. and one in the UK. Most of our industrial specialties and some of our pavement technologies products are derived from crude tall oil ("CTO"), a co-product of the kraft pulping process, where pine trees are used as the source of the pulp. We also produce products derived from lignin, which is extracted from black liquor, another co-product of the kraft pulping process.
We typically source over 80 percent of our CTO needs through long-term supply contracts. The remainder of our CTO needs is sourced through short-term contracts and spot purchases in the open market. Most of our long-term contracted volumes are sourced through two primary parties: WestRock and Georgia-Pacific LLC (“Georgia-Pacific”). During 2022, we sourced approximately 75 percent of our CTO and CTO equivalent volumes of black liquor soap skimming ("BLSS"), the precursor to CTO, from WestRock and Georgia-Pacific combined. These relationships with WestRock and Georgia-Pacific are strategically important to our Performance Chemicals business due to the limited supply of CTO globally, a significant portion of which we believe is already under long-term supply agreements with other consumers of CTO.
There are other pressures on the availability of CTO. Some pulp or paper mills may choose to consume their production of CTO to meet their energy needs or reduce their carbon footprint, rather than sell the CTO to third parties. Weather conditions have in the past and may in the future affect the availability and quality of pine trees used in the kraft pulping process and, therefore, the availability of CTO that meets Ingevity’s quality standards. Geopolitical risk factors could constrain CTO availability. For example, sanctions imposed on Russia in 2022 have constrained the global CTO supply by approximately 10 percent. 
Also, there are regulatory pressures that may incentivize suppliers of CTO to sell CTO into alternative fuel markets (i.e., biofuels) rather than to historical end users such as Ingevity. CTO-based biofuel has been deemed to meet the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive, second phase (“RED II”) biofuel sustainability criteria. As a consequence of RED II, there has been a significant increase in demand for CTO and its derivatives, resulting in significantly increasing prices. 
In addition to these developments in the EU, various pieces of legislation regarding the use of alternative fuels have been introduced in the U.S. at both the federal and state level. Currently, none of the U.S. legislation mandates or provides incentives for the use of CTO or its derivatives as a biofuel. Future legislation in the U.S. and elsewhere may promote the use of CTO or its derivatives as a feedstock for the production of biofuels, further constraining supply.
Because the supply of CTO is inherently constrained by the volume of kraft pulp processing as discussed above, as well as the recent diversion of CTO for the production of alternative fuels, the availability of CTO supply as a raw material for the pine-based chemicals industry is under pressure. This pressure has increased and we expect will continue to drive the cost of CTO to unprecedented levels. CTO accounted for approximately 14 percent of our consolidated cost of sales and 22 percent of our full company raw materials purchases in 2022. 
As described above, the pricing and availability of CTO are impacted by the limited supply of the product and competing demands for its use, both of which drive pressure on its price. To diversify our raw material stream, we converted a portion of our Crossett, Arkansas CTO facility to run non-CTO-based alternative fatty acids ("AFA"). We currently sell AFA as well as AFA derivatives into end markets such as oilfield and industrial applications. We have invested and will continue to invest, in AFA production capacity at our Crossett, Arkansas facility as we expand the commercialization of our product offerings in existing and new markets, which may include the biofuels market.
Our engineered polymers' products are caprolactone based, which is derived from cyclohexanone, a benzene derivative, and hydrogen peroxide, both of which are readily available in the market. We maintain multiple suppliers of cyclohexanone to protect against supply disruptions and to maintain competitive pricing. Our hydrogen peroxide is currently supplied by Solvay Interox Limited, a co-located supplier at our Warrington, UK facility under a long-term supply agreement. 
The other key raw materials used in the Performance Chemicals business are maleic anhydride, pentaerythritol, and ethylene amines. These are sourced where possible through multiple suppliers to protect against supply disruptions and to maintain competitive pricing.
Markets Served
Pavement Technologies
Our pavement technologies product line produces a broad line of innovative additives and technologies utilized globally in road construction and pavement preservation, including pavement reconstruction and recycling. With the acquisition of Ozark Materials, LLC and Ozark Logistics, LLC (collectively, “Ozark Materials”), we have added road striping technologies to the portfolio.
Warm Mix Asphalt. Evotherm®, our premier road construction additive, is a warm mix asphalt technology that promotes adhesion by acting as both a liquid antistrip and a warm mix asphalt. Once Evotherm® is mixed into the binder utilized for road layer construction, production temperatures can be significantly cooler than conventional hot mix asphalt. Lower production temperatures allow our customers to reduce emissions and fuel use during road construction as well as extend their paving seasons into colder months.
Pavement Preservation. We provide an array of pavement preservation products that eliminate many traditional asphalt heating, mixing, and transportation demands – saving our customers time, energy, and money. Our technical team matches the right emulsifier and design to our customers’ materials and conditions to create high-performing emulsions. We offer a full range of specialized cationic, anionic, and amphoteric emulsifiers with additional, custom-formulated specialty additives.
Pavement Reconstruction and Recycling. We provide an array of pavement reconstruction and recycling additives that reduce the life cycle cost of pavement by enabling the milling and reuse of existing roadways. Our cold in-place recycling additives allow our customers to reopen existing roadways faster, while also lowering overall costs and jobsite emissions. 
Thermoplastic Pavement Markings. We provide alkyd and hydrocarbon premium-based thermoplastic road striping technologies which provide long service life, excellent adhesion, superior color, and retro-reflectivity. Based on the customer and/or governmental agency requirements, the markings can be designed for varying levels of initial and retained performance properties.
