ITEM 1.

BUSINESS 
 ​
 General Overview 
 Bank First National Corporation is a Wisconsin corporation that was organized in April 1982 to serve as the holding company for Bank First, N.A., a national banking association founded in 1894. The Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company and the Bank are headquartered in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, and the Bank is a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). The Bank has eighteen (18) offices, including its headquarters, in Manitowoc, Outagamie, Brown, Winnebago, Sheboygan, Waupaca, and Barron counties in the State of Wisconsin. We serve businesses, professionals and consumers with a wide variety of financial services, including retail and commercial banking. Some of the products that we offer include checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, cash management accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, residential mortgages, consumer loans, credit cards, online banking, telephone banking and mobile banking. 
 The Bank has three subsidiaries: UFS, LLC (“UFS”), Bank First Investments, Inc. and TVG Holdings, Inc. (“TVG”). UFS is a Wisconsin limited liability company organized in 2014, in which the Bank is a 49.8% member. UFS provides core data processing and information technology services to the Bank and many other community banks in and around Wisconsin. Bank First Investments, Inc. is a Wisconsin corporation organized in 2011, and is wholly-owned by the Bank. Bank First Investments, Inc.’s purpose is to provide investment and safekeeping services to the Bank. TVG is a Wisconsin corporation organized in 2009. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, and its purpose is to hold the Bank’s 30% ownership interest in Ansay & Associates, LLC (“Ansay”). Ansay is one of the nation’s largest independent insurance providers, and the Bank’s minority ownership of Ansay allows the Bank to provide diversified services to our customers without the risk and expense of an in-house insurance department. Aside from the Bank, the Company also has another wholly-owned subsidiary, Veritas Asset Holdings, LLC, a troubled asset liquidation company. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had total consolidated assets of $1.79 billion, total loans of $1.43 billion, total deposits of $1.56 billion and total stockholders’ equity of $174.3 million. The Bank employs approximately 253 full-time equivalent employees (“FTE”), and has an assets-to-FTE ratio of approximately $7.2 million. For more information, see the Bank’s website at www.bankfirstwi.bank. 
 Recent acquisitions 
 On October 27, 2017, the Company completed a merger with Waupaca Bancorporation, Inc. (“Waupaca”), a bank holding company headquartered in Waupaca, Wisconsin, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 11, 2017 and as amended on July 20, 2017, by and among the Company, BFNC Merger Sub, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Waupaca, whereby Waupaca merged with and into the Company, and First National Bank, Waupaca’s wholly-owned banking subsidiary, was merged with and into the Bank. Waupaca’s principal activity was the ownership and operation of First National Bank, a national banking institution that operated eight (8) branches in Wisconsin at the time of closing. The merger consideration totaled approximately $78,060,000, 70% of which was distributed in cash and 30% of which was distributed in the form of Company common stock. 
 On January 22, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Partnership Community Bancshares, Inc., a Wisconsin Corporation (“PCB”), pursuant to which PCB will merge with and into the Company, and Partnership Bank, PCB’s wholly-owned banking subsidiary, will merge with and into the Bank. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Company has committed to purchase from PCB all of the issued and outstanding shares of PCB common stock in a combined stock-and-cash transaction, pursuant to which each PCB shareholder will receive either $17.3832 in cash or 0.35047 of a share of the Company’s common stock in exchange for each share of PCB common stock. The acquisition is valued at approximately $41.0 million at the date of announcement, and

 the merger consideration will consist of 65% in Company common stock and 35% in cash. As of December 31, 2018, PCB had approximately $306.8 million in consolidated assets, $267.1 million in net loans, $261.6 million in deposits and $21.6 million in consolidated stockholders’ equity. Consummation of the merger is subject to, among other things, the receipt of approval by regulatory authorities and PCB shareholders. The acquisition is expected to be completed sometime in the third quarter of 2019. 
Strategic Plan 
 The Bank is a relationship-based community bank focused on providing innovative products and services that are value driven. The Bank’s culture celebrates diversity, creativity, and responsiveness, with the highest ethical standards. Employees are encouraged and empowered to develop their careers and always do the right thing. We maintain a strong credit culture as a foundation of sound asset quality, and we embrace innovation and provide the solutions our customers need and expect. The Bank’s vision is to remain an independent community bank and plans to sustain its independence by remaining one of the top-performing providers of financial services in Wisconsin. The Bank focuses on creating value for the communities and customers it serves to provide exceptional return for our shareholders, and also growing relationship deposits and lending those funds to invest in and support the communities the Bank serves, ultimately yielding superior growth in earnings per share. 
 Our strategic priorities are organized around the CAMELS ratings, including Capital, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to Market Rates. Under the heading of Capital, our priorities include review of our capital strategy, reducing problem loans to enhance capital, exploring contingency capital options, and listing on the Nasdaq (accomplished during 2018) to enhance liquidity and currency for future potential mergers and acquisitions. Under the heading of Asset Quality, our priorities include infusing our credit culture in our Western Region, developing a current expected credit loss model, restructuring our credit department, restructuring our commercial loan operations department, and continuing to leverage investments in the special assets group to reduce the level of non-performing assets. Under the heading of Management, our priorities are to restructure the compliance department, restructure the information technology function with a focus on cybersecurity, to consistently improve our employee experience and engagement throughout the organization, to improve role clarity within the senior management team, and to add depth to the succession plan. Under the Earnings heading, our priorities are to grow deeper and wider relationships with our existing customers, to develop a strategy to increase our millennial customer base, to continue exploring opportunities for mergers and acquisitions and de novo growth, and to build our agriculture banking department. Under the Liquidity heading, our priorities are to maintain stable core deposits, with an emphasis on demand deposit accounts, to expand our treasury management capabilities, and to explore additional liquidity options. Finally, under the heading of Sensitivity to Market Rates, our priorities include continuing to emphasize relationship-based banking, developing asset liability management strategies, and continuing to adjust our investment portfolio model to eliminate optionality. 
 Our strategic plan includes the following measures of long-term success: (i) earnings per share growth; (ii) return on assets; (iii) total risk-based capital ratio; (iv) assets-to-FTE ratio; (v) core deposit growth; and (vi) classified assets to total risk-based capital ratio.

 The economies of our primary markets in Manitowoc, Sheboygan, and Waupaca counties are largely driven by the food service, manufacturing, insurance, and healthcare industries. Companies with their headquarters in this area include Lakeside Foods, Point Beach Nuclear Plant, Acuity Insurance, Kohler Co., Johnsonville Sausage, Bemis, and Sargento Foods. In addition, Brown County is home to Green Bay, a major Wisconsin city, with a thriving tourism industry. The region also includes a number of higher education centers, including state universities and technical colleges. 
 Competition 
 The banking business is highly competitive, and we face competition in our market areas from many other local, regional, and national financial institutions. Competition among financial institutions is based on interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans, other credit and service charges relating to loans, the quality and scope of the services rendered, the convenience of banking facilities, and, in the case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as regional and national financial institutions that operate offices in our market areas and elsewhere. The competing major commercial banks have greater resources that may provide them a competitive advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous branch offices, mount extensive advertising campaigns and invest in new technologies. The increasingly competitive environment is the result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, additional financial service providers, and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers. 
 The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. 
 Some of our non-banking competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. In addition, some of our competitors have assets, capital and lending limits greater than that of the Bank, have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader range of products and services than the Bank. These institutions may have the ability to finance 

  ​

 wide-ranging advertising campaigns and may also be able to offer lower rates on loans and higher rates on deposits than we can offer. Some of these institutions offer services, such as international banking, which we do not directly offer, except for a limited suite of services such as international wires and currency exchange. 
 We compete with these institutions by focusing on our position as an independent, community bank and rely upon local promotional activities, personal relationships established by our officers, directors, and employees with our customers, and specialized services tailored to meet the needs of the communities served. We provide innovative products to our customers that are value-driven. We actively cultivate relationships with our customers that extend beyond a single loan to a full suite of products that serve the needs of our retail and commercial customers. Our goal is to develop long-standing connections with our customers and the communities that we serve. While our position varies by market, our management believes that it can compete effectively as a result of local market knowledge, local decision making, and awareness of customer needs. 
 Our Business 
 General 
 We emphasize a range of lending services, including commercial and residential real estate loans, construction and development loans, commercial and industrial loans and consumer loans. Our customers are generally individuals, small to medium-sized businesses and professional firms that are located in or conduct a substantial portion of their business in our market areas. At December 31, 2018, we had total loans receivable of $1.43 billion, representing approximately 82.4% of our total earning assets. As of December 31, 2018, we had 62 nonaccrual loans totaling approximately $20.1 million, or 1.4% of total loans. For additional discussion related to nonperforming loans, see the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
Loan Approval 
 Certain credit risks are inherent in making loans. These include prepayment risks, risks resulting from uncertainties in the future value of collateral, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers. We attempt to mitigate repayment risks by adhering to our comprehensive and robust internal credit policies and procedures. These policies and procedures include officer and customer lending limits, with approval process for larger loans, documentation examination, and follow-up procedures for any exceptions to credit policies. Our loan approval policies provide for various levels of officer lending authority. The Bank currently employs both a signature process through the line of business as well as credit administration and a committee process which involves the Bank’s board of directors each month. Both approvals and reviews of the credit actions are underwritten by an independent set of credit analysts who report to credit administration. For our loan commitments, a serial sign-off process is utilized up to $3,000,000, requiring multiple signatures for a loan approval. This process ensures that the necessary parties at all authority levels are aware of and approve the commitment. The Bank’s board of directors is involved in credits above this level after they have been through the serial sign-off process. We do not make any loans to any director, executive officer of the Bank, or the related interests of each, unless the loan is approved by the full board of directors of the Bank and is on terms not more favorable than would be available to a person not affiliated with the Bank. 
Credit Administration and Loan Review 
 Our loan review consists of both commercial and retail review where loan files are reviewed and risk ratings are validated. Both have been partially outsourced in 2018 to a firm that specializes in file review and risk rating. The commercial review consists currently of documentation review of credits the third party has reviewed. This function will grow as the year progresses and this position is currently being evaluated with the help of our compliance department. Our policy for reviewing commercial credit files consisted of selecting a percentage of specific files on an annual basis, and reviewing them for risk rating and policy compliance. Our retail review consists of selecting a percentage of specific files, on an annual basis, and reviewing them for policy compliance.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Lending Limits 
 Our lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by federal law. In general, the Bank is subject to a legal limit on loans to a single borrower equal to 15% of the Bank’s capital and unimpaired surplus. This legal lending limit will increase or decrease as the Bank’s level of capital increases or decreases. In addition to the legal lending limit, management and the board of directors have established a more conservative, internal lending limit. The Bank’s legal and internal lending limits are a safety and soundness measure intended to prevent one person or a relatively small and economically related group of persons from borrowing an unduly large amount of the Bank’s funds. It is also intended to safeguard the Bank’s depositors by diversifying the risk of loan losses among a relatively large number of creditworthy borrowers engaged in various types of businesses. Based upon the capitalization of the Bank at December 31, 2018, the Bank’s legal lending limit was $26.8 million and the Bank’s internal lending limit was $21.4 million. Our board of directors will adjust the internal lending limit as deemed necessary to continue to mitigate risk and serve the Bank’s clients. We are also able to sell participations in our larger loans to other financial institutions, which allows us to manage the risk involved in these loans and to meet the lending needs of our clients requiring extensions of credit in excess of these limits. 
Real Estate Loans 
 The principal component of our loan portfolio is loans secured by real estate. Real estate loans are subject to the same general risks as other loans and are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the value of real estate. Fluctuations in the value of real estate and rising interest rates, as well as other factors arising after a loan has been made, could negatively affect a borrower’s cash flow, creditworthiness, and ability to repay the loan. We obtain a security interest in real estate whenever possible, in addition to any other available collateral, in order to increase the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan. 
 As of December 31, 2018, loans secured by real estate made up approximately $1.04 billion, or 72.6%, of our loan portfolio. These loans generally will fall into one of two categories: 
 •

  Commercial Real Estate.   Commercial real estate loans generally have terms of 20 years or less, although payments may be structured on a longer amortization basis. We evaluate each borrower on an individual basis and attempt to determine their business risks and credit profile. We attempt to reduce credit risk in the commercial real estate portfolio by emphasizing loans on owner-occupied industrial, office, and retail buildings where the loan-to-value ratio, established by independent appraisals, does not generally exceed 85% of cost or appraised value. We also generally require that a borrower’s cash flow exceed 110% of monthly debt service obligations. In order to ensure secondary sources of payment and liquidity to support a loan request, we typically review all of the personal financial statements of the principal owners and require their personal guaranties. Commercial real estate loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans. They are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and depend on cash flows from the owner’s business or the property to service the debt. Because our loan portfolio contains a number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in our levels of nonperforming assets. As of December 31, 2018, commercial real estate loans made up approximately $668.4 million or 46.8% of our loan portfolio. 
 ​
 •

  Residential Mortgage Loans and Home Equity Loans.   We originate and hold short-term and long-term first mortgages and traditional second mortgage residential real estate loans. Generally, we limit the loan-to-value ratio on our residential real estate loans to 90%. We offer fixed and adjustable rate residential real estate loans with terms of up to 30 years. We also offer a variety of lot loan options to consumers to purchase the lot on which they intend build their home. The options available depend on whether the borrower intends to begin building within 36 months of the lot purchase or at an undetermined future date. We also offer traditional home equity loans and lines of credit. Our underwriting criteria for, and the risks associated with, home equity loans and lines of credit are generally the same as those for first mortgage loans. Home equity loans typically have terms of 20 years or less. We generally limit the extension of credit to 90% of the available equity of each property. As of December 31, 2018, residential mortgage loans and home equity loans made up approximately $368.7 million or 25.8% of our loan portfolio.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Commercial and Industrial Loans 
 We have significant expertise in small to middle market commercial and industrial lending. Our success is the result of our product and market expertise, and our focus on delivering high-quality, customized and quick turnaround service for our clients due to our focus on maintaining an appropriate balance between prudent, disciplined underwriting, on the one hand, and flexibility in our decision making and responsiveness to our clients, on the other hand, which has allowed us to grow our commercial and industrial loan portfolio while maintaining strong asset quality. As of December 31, 2018, commercial and industrial loans made up approximately $297.3 million or 20.8% of our loan portfolio. 
 We provide a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial and industrial loans. The loans are typically made to small- and medium-sized businesses involved in professional services, accommodation and food services, health care, wholesale trade, financial institutions, manufacturing, distribution, retailing and non-profits. We extend commercial business loans for working capital, accounts receivable and inventory financing and other business purposes. Generally, short-term loans have maturities ranging from 3 months to 1 year, and “term loans” have maturities ranging from 3 to 20 years. Loans are generally intended to finance current transactions and typically provide for periodic principal payments, with interest payable monthly. Term loans generally provide for floating and fixed interest rates, with monthly payments of both principal and interest. 
 Construction and Development Loans 
 We offer fixed and adjustable rate residential and commercial construction loan financing to builders and developers and to consumers who wish to build their own home. The term of construction and development loans generally is limited to 9 to 24 months, although payments may be structured on a longer amortization basis. Most loans will mature and require payment in full upon the sale of the property. We believe that construction and development loans generally carry a higher degree of risk than long-term financing of stabilized, rented, and owner-occupied properties because repayment depends on the ultimate completion of the project and usually on the subsequent sale of the property. Specific risks include: 
 •

 cost overruns; 
 ​
 •

 mismanaged construction; 
 ​
 •

 inferior or improper construction techniques; 
 ​
 •

 economic changes or downturns during construction; 
 ​
 •

 a downturn in the real estate market; 
 ​
 •

 rising interest rates which may prevent sale of the property; and 
 ​
 •

 failure to sell or stabilize completed projects in a timely manner. 
 ​
 We attempt to reduce risk associated with construction and development loans by obtaining personal guaranties and by keeping the maximum loan-to-value ratio at or below 80%-90% of the lesser of cost or appraised value, depending on the project type. Generally, we do not have interest reserves built into loan commitments but require periodic cash payments for interest from the borrower’s cash flow. As of December 31, 2018, construction and development loans made up approximately $60.8 million or 4.3% of our loan portfolio. 
 Consumer Loans 
 We make a variety of loans to individuals for personal and household purposes, including secured and unsecured installment loans and revolving lines of credit. Consumer loans are underwritten based on the borrower’s income, current debt level, past credit history, and the availability and value of collateral. Consumer rates are both fixed and variable, with negotiable terms. Our installment loans typically amortize over periods up to seven years. Although we typically require monthly principal and interest payments on our loan products, we will offer consumer loans with a single maturity date when a specific source of repayment is available. Consumer loans are generally considered to have greater risk than first or second mortgages on real estate because 

  ​

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 they may be unsecured, or, if they are secured, the value of the collateral may be difficult to assess and more likely to decrease in value than real estate. As of December 31, 2018, consumer loans made up approximately $27.0 million or 1.9% of our loan portfolio. 
Mortgage Banking Activities 
 Our mortgage banking operations include correspondent or secondary market lending, and in-house mortgage lending (included in residential mortgage and home equity loan totals above). We conduct secondary market lending through Fannie Mae, Franklin American Mortgage Company, and the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority. We also offer a number of in-house mortgage products, including (1) adjustable rate mortgages at three, five, seven, ten, and fifteen years, and (2) fixed rate mortgages at up to twenty years. We also offer a nine-month construction loan, and a twelve-month bridge loan. 
Deposit Products 
 We offer a full range of traditional deposit services through our branch network in our market areas that are typically available in most banks and savings institutions, including checking accounts, commercial accounts, savings accounts and other time deposits of various types, ranging from money market accounts to long-term certificates of deposit. Transaction accounts and time deposits are tailored to and offered at rates competitive to those offered in our primary market areas. We also offer retirement accounts and health savings accounts. Our customers include individuals, businesses, associations, organizations and governmental authorities. We believe that our branch infrastructure will assist us in obtaining deposits from local customers in the future. Our deposits are insured by the FDIC up to statutory limits. 
Securities 
 We manage our securities portfolio and cash to maintain adequate liquidity and to ensure the safety and preservation of invested principal, with a secondary focus on yield and returns. Specific goals of our investment portfolio are as follows: 
 •

 provide a ready source of balance sheet liquidity, ensuring adequate availability of funds to meet fluctuations in loan demand, deposit balances and other changes in balance sheet volumes and composition; 
 ​
 •

 serve as a means for diversification of our assets with respect to credit quality, maturity and other attributes; 
 ​
 •

 serve as a tool for modifying our interest rate risk profile pursuant to our established policies; and 
 ​
 •

 provide collateral to secure municipal and business deposits. 
 ​
 Our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of U.S. government securities, mortgage-backed securities backed by government-sponsored entities, and taxable and tax-exempt municipal securities. 
 Our investment policy is reviewed annually by our board of directors. Overall investment goals are established by our board, CEO, and members of our Asset Liability Committee (“ALCO”). Our board of directors has delegated the responsibility of monitoring our investment activities to our ALCO. Day-to-day activities pertaining to the securities portfolio are conducted under the supervision of our CEO. We actively monitor our investments on an ongoing basis to identify any material changes in the securities. We also review our securities for potential other-than-temporary impairment at least quarterly. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 253 FTEs. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or is a party to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements. 
General Corporate Information 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 402 N. 8th Street, Manitowoc, Wisconsin 54220, and our telephone number at that address is (920) 652-3100.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Public Information 
 Persons interested in obtaining information on the Company may read and copy any materials that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. 
Supervision and Regulation 
 We are extensively regulated under federal and state law. The following is a brief summary that does not purport to be a complete description of all regulations that affect us or all aspects of those regulations. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions described below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to the Company’s and the Bank’s business. In addition, proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal levels. The likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations, and the impact such changes may have on us and the Bank, are difficult to predict. In addition, bank regulatory agencies may issue enforcement actions, policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to us or the Bank. Changes in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory guidance, or their interpretation by regulatory agencies or courts may have a material adverse effect on our and the Bank’s business, operations, and earnings. Supervision and regulation of banks, their holding companies and affiliates is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and customers, the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC, and the U.S. banking and financial system rather than holders of our capital stock. 
 Regulation of the Company 
 We are registered as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). As such, we are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve and are subject to its regulatory reporting requirements. Federal law subjects bank holding companies, such as the Company, to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in regulatory agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease-and-desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company. 
  Activity Limitations.   Bank holding companies are generally restricted to engaging in the business of banking, managing or controlling banks and certain other activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking. In addition, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any nonbanking activity or terminate its ownership or control of any nonbank subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company. 
  Source of Strength Obligations.   A bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to maintain resources adequate to support its bank. The term “source of financial strength” means the ability of a company, such as us, that directly or indirectly owns or controls an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event of financial distress. The appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution (in the case of the Bank, this agency is the OCC) may require reports from us to assess our ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the source of strength requirements by requiring us to provide financial assistance to the Bank in the event of financial distress. 
  Acquisitions.   The BHC Act permits acquisitions of banks by bank holding companies, such that we and any other bank holding company, whether located in Wisconsin or elsewhere, may acquire a bank located in any other state, subject to certain deposit-percentage, age of bank charter requirements, and other restrictions. The BHC Act requires that a bank holding company 

  ​

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any additional bank or bank holding company, (ii) taking any action that causes an additional bank or bank holding company to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company, or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. The Federal Reserve may not approve any such transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider: (1) the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved, including pro forma capital ratios; (2) the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system; (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including performance under the CRA; and (4) the effectiveness of the companies in combatting money laundering. 
  Change in Control.   Federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act and the regulations thereunder, a person or group must give advance notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company, such as the Company, and the OCC before acquiring control of any national bank, such as the Bank. Upon receipt of such notice, the bank regulatory agencies may approve or disapprove the acquisition. The Change in Bank Control Act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a member or group acquires a certain percentage or more of a bank holding company’s or bank’s voting stock, or if one or more other control factors are present. As a result, a person or entity generally must provide prior notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring the power to vote 10% or more of our outstanding common stock. The overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation. Consequently, shareholders of the Company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies. Investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of our stock. 
  Governance and Financial Reporting Obligations.   We are required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”), and Nasdaq. In particular, we are required to include management and independent registered public accounting firm reports on internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have evaluated our controls, including compliance with the SEC rules on internal controls, and have and expect to continue to spend significant amounts of time and money on compliance with these rules. Our failure to comply with these internal control rules may materially adversely affect our reputation, ability to obtain the necessary certifications to financial statements, and the values of our securities. The assessments of our financial reporting controls as of December 31, 2018 are included in this report under “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.” 
  Corporate Governance.   The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protections, corporate governance, and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act (1) grants shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation; (2) enhances independence requirements for Compensation Committee members; and (3) requires companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt incentive-based compensation claw-back policies for executive officers. 
  Incentive Compensation.   The Dodd-Frank Act required the banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint rules or guidelines for financial institutions with more than $1 billion in assets, such as us and the Bank, which prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that the agencies determine to encourage inappropriate risks by the institution. The banking agencies issued proposed rules in 2011 and previously issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies. 

  ​

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 In 2016, the Federal Reserve and the OCC also proposed rules that would, depending upon the assets of the institution, directly regulate incentive compensation arrangements and would require enhanced oversight and recordkeeping. As of December 31, 2018, these rules have not been implemented. We and the Bank have undertaken efforts to ensure that our incentive compensation plans do not encourage inappropriate risks, consistent with three key principles—that incentive compensation arrangements should appropriately balance risk and financial rewards, be compatible with effective controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance. 
  Shareholder Say-On-Pay Votes.   The Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to take shareholders’ votes on proposals addressing compensation (known as say-on-pay), the frequency of a say-on-pay vote, and the golden parachutes available to executives in connection with change-in-control transactions. Public companies must give shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation at least every three years and the opportunity to vote on frequency at least every six years, indicating whether the say-on-pay vote should be held annually, biennially, or triennially. The say-on-pay, the say-on-parachute and the say-on-frequency votes are explicitly nonbinding and cannot override a decision of our board of directors. 
  Other Regulatory Matters.   We and our subsidiaries are subject to oversight by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, (“FINRA”), the PCAOB, Nasdaq and various state securities regulators. We and our subsidiaries have from time to time received requests for information from regulatory authorities in various states, including state attorneys general, securities regulators and other regulatory authorities, concerning our business practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business. 
Capital Requirements 
 The Bank is required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the federal banking agencies may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risks arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution’s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account by the federal banking agencies in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of these capital rules and their potential impact on our capital levels. 
 The Bank is subject to the following risk-based capital ratios: a common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, which includes CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital, and a total capital ratio, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. CET1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock, retained earnings, and certain qualifying minority interests, less certain adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets subject to temporary timing differences. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments disqualified from Tier 1 capital, including qualifying subordinated debt, other preferred stock and certain hybrid capital instruments, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, subject to certain eligibility criteria. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for example, certain “high volatility” commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities and equity holdings. 
 The leverage capital ratio, which serves as a minimum capital standard, is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. The required minimum leverage ratio for all banks is 4%. 
 In addition, the capital rules require a capital conservation buffer of up to 2.5% above each of the minimum capital ratio requirements (CET1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital), which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. These buffer requirements must be

 met for a bank to be able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management without restriction. This capital conservation buffer is being phased in, and was 1.875% as of January 1, 2018 and is 2.5% effective January 1, 2019. 
 Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition. For example, only a well-capitalized depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on its growth. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” regarding depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five regulatory capital tiers: “well capitalized”, “adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized”, and “critically undercapitalized”. A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. The FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive restraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC, are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans for regulatory approval. A depository institution’s holding company must guarantee any required capital restoration plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5 percent of the depository institution’s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. Federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. All of the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted regulations establishing relevant capital measures and relevant capital levels for federally insured depository institutions. The Bank was well capitalized at December 31, 2018, and brokered deposits are not restricted. 
 To be well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain at least the following capital ratios: 
 •

 6.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 
 ​
 •

 8.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; 
 ​
 •

 10.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and 
 ​
 •

 5.0% leverage ratio. 
 ​
 The Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were above the applicable well-capitalized standards and met the then-applicable capital conservation buffer. Based on current estimates, we believe that the Bank will continue to exceed all applicable well-capitalized regulatory capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer in 2019. 
 The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”) signed into law in May 2018 scaled back certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and provided other regulatory relief. Among the provisions of the Economic Growth Act was a requirement that the Federal Reserve raise the asset threshold for those bank holding companies subject to the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (“Policy Statement”) to $3 billion. As a result, as of the effective date of that change in 2018, the Company was no longer required to comply with the risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank as described above. The Federal Reserve may however, require smaller bank holding companies subject to the Policy Statement to maintain certain minimum capital levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company’s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 On November 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a proposed rule to simplify the regulatory capital requirements for eligible banks and holding companies with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets that opt into the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (“CBLR”) framework, as required by Section 201 of the Economic Growth, Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”). The Regulatory Relief Act mandates that the banking agencies develop a CBLR of not less than 8% and not more than 10% for qualifying community banking organizations. A qualifying community banking organization that exceeds the CBLR threshold would be exempt from the agencies’ current capital framework, including the risk-based capital requirements and capital conservation buffer described above, and would be deemed well-capitalized under the agencies’ prompt corrective action regulations. The Regulatory Relief Act defines a “qualifying community banking organization” as a depository institution or depository institution holding company with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. Under the proposed rule, if a qualifying community banking organization elects to use the CBLR framework, it will be considered “well-capitalized” so long as its CBLR is greater than 9%. The agencies are expected to issue a final rule in the first quarter of 2019. 
 On December 21, 2018, federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the upcoming implementation of the “current expected credit losses” (“CECL”) accounting standard under GAAP; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, which introduced CECL as the methodology to replace the current “incurred loss” methodology for financial assets measured at amortized cost, and changed the approaches for recognizing and recording credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased credit impaired financial assets. Under the incurred loss methodology, credit losses are recognized only when the losses are probable or have been incurred; under CECL, companies are required to recognize the full amount of expected credit losses for the lifetime of the financial assets, based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This change will result in earlier recognition of credit losses that the Company deems expected but not yet probable. For SEC reporting companies with December 31 fiscal-year ends, such as the Company, CECL will become effective beginning with the first quarter of 2020. 
 Payment of Dividends 
 We are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and our other subsidiaries. Our primary source of cash, other than securities offerings, is dividends from the Bank. The prior approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank (such as the Bank) in any calendar year will exceed the sum of such bank’s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. Federal law also prohibits any national bank from paying dividends that would be greater than such bank’s undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debts in excess of such bank’s allowance for possible loan losses.
 In addition, we and the Bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal bank regulatory authority may prohibit the payment of dividends where it has determined that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. The OCC and the Federal Reserve have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsound and unsafe banking practice. The OCC and the Federal Reserve have each indicated that depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. 
 Under a Federal Reserve policy adopted in 2009, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider different factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to maintaining a strong financial position, and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios, such as potential events that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a strong financial 

  ​

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s dividends if: 
 •

 its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; 
 ​
 •

 its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or 
 ​
 •

 it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. 
 ​
 Prior approval by the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year exceeds the bank’s profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years. 
 Regulation of the Bank 
 As a national bank, our primary bank subsidiary, Bank First, N.A., is subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the OCC and is subject to its regulatory reporting requirements. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC and, accordingly, the Bank is also subject to certain FDIC regulations and the FDIC has backup examination authority and some enforcement powers over the Bank. The Bank also is subject to certain Federal Reserve regulations. 
 In addition, as discussed in more detail below, the Bank and any other of our subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products and services are subject to regulation and potential supervision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Authority to supervise and examine the Company and the Bank for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations on a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. The CFPB also may participate in examinations of our other direct or indirect subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products or services. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce certain federal consumer financial protection rules adopted by the CFPB. 
 Broadly, regulations applicable to the Bank include limitations on loans to a single borrower and to its directors, officers and employees; restrictions on the opening and closing of branch offices; the maintenance of required capital and liquidity ratios; the granting of credit under equal and fair conditions; the disclosure of the costs and terms of such credit; requirements to maintain reserves against deposits and loans; limitations on the types of investment that may be made by the Bank; and requirements governing risk management practices. The Bank is permitted under federal law to branch on a de novo basis across state lines where the laws of that state would permit a bank chartered by that state to open a de novo branch. 
  Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders.   The Bank is subject to restrictions on extensions of credit and certain other transactions between the Bank and the Company or any nonbank affiliate. Generally, these covered transactions with either the Company or any affiliate are limited to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus, and all such transactions between the Bank and the Company and all of its nonbank affiliates combined are limited to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. Loans and other extensions of credit from the Bank to the Company or any affiliate generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. In addition, any transaction between the Bank and the Company or any affiliate are required to be on an arm’s length basis. Federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on certain extensions of credit by insured banks, such as the Bank, to their directors, executive officers and principal shareholders. 
  Reserves.   Federal Reserve rules require depository institutions, such as the Bank, to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts, primarily NOW and regular checking accounts. For 2019, the first $16.3 million of covered balances are exempt from these reserve requirements, aggregate balances between $16.3 million and $124.2 million are subject to a 3% reserve 

  ​

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 requirement, and aggregate balances above $124.2 million are subject to a reserve requirement of $3,237,000 plus 10% of the amount over $124.2 million. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve. 
  FDIC Insurance Assessments and Depositor Preference.   The Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC’s DIF up to the limits under applicable law, which currently are set at $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. The Bank is subject to FDIC assessments for its deposit insurance. The FDIC calculates quarterly deposit insurance assessments based on an institution’s average total consolidated assets less its average tangible equity, and applies one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels, supervisory ratings, and certain other factors. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. On September 30, 2018, the FDIC announced that the designated reserve ratio (“DRR”) of the DIF reached 1.36 percent, exceeding the required 1.35 percent, two years ahead of the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. Though the FDIC has clarified that assessment rates will not change in the immediate future, banks with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Bank, will start receiving credits against their deposit insurance assessments when the DRR reaches or exceeds 1.38 percent. In addition, the Bank is subject to quarterly assessments by the FDIC to pay interest on Financing Corporation (“FICO”) bonds. The FDIC has announced that the remaining FICO bonds are expected to mature in September 2019, and that the final FICO assessment is expected to be made in March 2019 (at a rate of 0.140 (annual) basis points). 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution, including those of the parent bank holding company. 
  Standards for Safety and Soundness.   The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (1) internal controls; (2) information systems and audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate risk exposure; and (6) asset quality. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans. 
  Anti-Money Laundering.   The International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorism Funding Act of 2001 specifies “know your customer” requirements that obligate financial institutions to take actions to verify the identity of the account holders in connection with opening an account at any U.S. financial institution. Banking regulators will consider compliance with the Act’s money laundering provisions in acting upon acquisition and merger proposals. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and have been active in imposing cease-and-desist and other regulatory orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations. Sanctions for violations of the Act can be imposed in an amount equal to twice the sum involved in the violating transaction, up to $1 million. Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (“USA PATRIOT”) Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and “know your customer” standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. The USA PATRIOT Act, and its implementing regulations 

  ​

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCen”), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, requires financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs with minimum standards that include: 
 •

 the development of internal policies, procedures, and controls; 
 ​
 •

 the designation of a compliance officer; 
 ​
 •

 an ongoing employee training program; and 
 ​
 •

 an independent audit function to test the programs. 
 ​
 Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these anti-money laundering obligations and recently have been active in imposing “cease-and-desist” and other regulatory orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be in violation of these requirements. In addition, FinCEN issued rules that became effective on May 11, 2018, that require, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions, covered financial institutions to identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners of legal entity customers. 
  Economic Sanctions.   The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and acts of Congress. OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. If we find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must undertake certain specified activities, which could include blocking or freezing the account or transaction requested, and we must notify the appropriate authorities. 
  Concentrations in Lending.   During 2006, the federal bank regulatory agencies released guidance on “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending” (the “Guidance”) and advised financial institutions of the risks posed by commercial real estate (“CRE”) lending concentrations. The Guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations. Higher allowances for loan losses and capital levels may also be required. The Guidance is triggered when CRE loan concentrations exceed either: 
 •

 Total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land of 100% or more of a bank’s total risk based capital; or 
 ​
 •

 Total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land of 300% or more of a bank’s total risk-based capital. 
 ​
 The Guidance also applies when a bank has a sharp increase in CRE loans or has significant concentrations of CRE secured by a particular property type. We have always had exposures to loans secured by commercial real estate due to the nature of our markets and the loan needs of both retail and commercial customers. We believe our long term experience in CRE lending, underwriting policies, internal controls, and other policies currently in place, as well as our loan and credit monitoring and administration procedures, are generally appropriate to managing our concentrations as required under the Guidance. 
  Community Reinvestment Act.   The Bank is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), which imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with their safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of entire communities where the bank accepts deposits, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The OCC’s assessment of the Bank’s CRA record is made available to the public. Further, a less than satisfactory CRA rating will slow, if not preclude, expansion of banking activities. Following the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLB”), CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual CRA reports must be made to a bank’s primary federal regulator. Federal CRA regulations require, among other things, that evidence of discrimination against applicants on a prohibited basis, and illegal or abusive lending practices be considered in the CRA evaluation. On April 3, 2018, the Department of the Treasury published recommendations for 

  ​

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 amending the regulations implementing the CRA; on August 28, 2018, the OCC issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking seeking industry comment on how the CRA might be modernized. The Bank has a rating of “Outstanding” in its most recent CRA evaluation. 
  Privacy and Data Security.   The GLB generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to customers annually. Financial institutions, however, will be required to comply with state law if it is more protective of consumer privacy than the GLB. The GLB also directed federal regulators, including the FDIC and the OCC, to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. The Bank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying customers in the event of a security breach. Under federal law, the Bank must disclose its privacy policy to consumers, permit customers to opt out of having nonpublic customer information disclosed to third parties in certain circumstances, and allow customers to opt out of receiving marketing solicitations based on information about the customer received from another subsidiary. States may adopt more extensive privacy protections. We are similarly required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal. Customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused. 
 Furthermore, the federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management. A financial institution is expected to implement multiple lines of defense against cyberattacks and ensure that their risk management procedures address the risk posed by potential cyber threats. A financial institution is further expected to maintain procedures to effectively respond to a cyberattack and resume operations following any such attack. The Company has adopted and implemented an Information Security Program to comply with the regulatory cybersecurity guidance. 
  Consumer Regulation.   Activities of the Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations include, among numerous other things, provisions that: 
 •

 limit the interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank, including new rules respecting the terms of credit cards and of debit card overdrafts; 
 ​
 •

 govern the Bank’s disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 
 ​
 •

 require the Bank to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether it is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 
 ​
 •

 prohibit the Bank from discriminating on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors when it makes decisions to extend credit; 
 ​
 •

 govern the manner in which the Bank may collect consumer debts; and 
 ​
 •

 prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in the provision of consumer financial products and services. 
 ​
  Mortgage Regulation.   The CFPB adopted a rule that implements the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “ATR/QM rule”), which requires lenders to consider, among other things, income, employment status, assets, payment amounts, and credit history before approving a mortgage, and provides a compliance “safe harbor” for lenders that issue certain “qualified mortgages.” The ATR/QM rule defines a “qualified mortgage” to have certain specified characteristics, and generally prohibit loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years from being qualified mortgages. The rule also establishes general underwriting criteria for qualified mortgages, including that monthly payments be calculated based on the highest payment that will apply in the first five years of the loan and that the borrower have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less than or equal to 43%. While “qualified mortgages” will generally be afforded safe harbor status, a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements will attach to “qualified mortgages” that are “higher priced mortgages” (which are generally subprime loans). In addition, the securitizer of asset-backed securities must retain not less than 5 percent of the 

  ​

19​

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities, unless subject to an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as “qualified residential mortgages.” 
 The CFPB has also issued rules to implement requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act pertaining to mortgage loan origination (including with respect to loan originator compensation and loan originator qualifications) as well as integrated mortgage disclosure rules. In addition, the CFPB has issued rules that require servicers to comply with new standards and practices with regard to: error correction; information disclosure; force-placement of insurance; information management policies and procedures; requiring information about mortgage loss mitigation options be provided to delinquent borrowers; providing delinquent borrowers access to servicer personnel with continuity of contact about the borrower’s mortgage loan account; and evaluating borrowers’ applications for available loss mitigation options. These rules also address initial rate adjustment notices for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), periodic statements for residential mortgage loans, and prompt crediting of mortgage payments and response to requests for payoff amounts. 
  Non-Discrimination Policies.   The Bank is also subject to, among other things, the provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”) and the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), both of which prohibit discrimination based on race or color, religion, national origin, sex, and familial status in any aspect of a consumer or commercial credit or residential real estate transaction. The Department of Justice (“DOJ”), and the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued an Interagency Policy Statement on Discrimination in Lending that provides guidance to financial institutions in determining whether discrimination exists, how the agencies will respond to lending discrimination, and what steps lenders might take to prevent discriminatory lending practices. The DOJ has increased its efforts to prosecute what it regards as violations of the ECOA and FHA.
