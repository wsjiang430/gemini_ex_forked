PART II
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
 Shoe Carnival, Inc. is one of the nation’s largest omnichannel sellers of family footwear. We operate a retail focused business model that aims to deliver the leading footwear shopping experience with the national name brands desired by our customers. Our "bricks" first, omnichannel approach provides customers easy access to our wide assortment of branded footwear for work, athletics, daily activities and special events via their choice of delivery channel. We have a proven track record selling branded footwear, such as Nike, Skechers, adidas, Puma, HEYDUDE, Converse, Vans and Crocs, and generating profits without incurring debt. We have been in business for 44 years and have been a public company subject to SEC reporting requirements since 1993. Since 1993, we have earned a profit in every year except one.
We have experienced transformational growth in our business over the last two fiscal years, driven primarily by changes in our marketing and pricing strategies and the consummation and integration of our first acquisition. Our total Diluted Net Income per Share earned over the past two fiscal years of $9.38 ($3.96 in Fiscal 2022 and $5.42 in Fiscal 2021) exceeded the Diluted Net Income per Share earned over the preceding 13 years combined.
As of our Fiscal 2022 year end, we operated 397 stores across 35 states and Puerto Rico. Including e-commerce sales in close proximity to a physical store, our comparable physical stores generated an average of $3.2 million in Net Sales in Fiscal 2022 and over $281 in Net Sales per square foot. We believe there is room within our existing markets to grow our store count to over 500 stores by 2028 through both organic and acquired store growth. We believe this opportunity to increase our scale, together with stable double-digit operating income margins, will continue to drive shareholder value and our future earnings potential.
 In Fiscal 2022, our Net Sales were $1.26 billion and our goal is to be a multi-billion dollar omnichannel retailer by 2028.
Our fiscal year is a 52/53 week year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Referred to herein, Fiscal 2022 is the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023; Fiscal 2021 is the fiscal year ended January 29, 2022; Fiscal 2020 is the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021; and Fiscal 2019 is the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020. Fiscal years 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019 all consisted of 52 weeks.

 Our Banners
 Shoe Carnival
 Our Shoe Carnival retail concept has developed over our 44 year history and is differentiated from competitors by our distinctive, fun and promotional marketing efforts. Shoe Carnival stores combine competitive pricing with a high-energy in-store environment that encourages customer participation. Unique features of our store experience include upbeat music, opportunities for customers to spin our spin-n-win wheel and a mic-person who runs in-store specials. These specials include contests, games and hot deals of the moment to encourage customers to take immediate advantage of our special, in-store pricing. As of our Fiscal 2022 year end, we operated 373 Shoe Carnival stores located across 35 states and Puerto Rico and offered online shopping at www.shoecarnival.com.
Shoe Station
 On December 3, 2021, we acquired the physical stores and substantially all of the other assets and liabilities of privately-held, family-owned Shoe Station, Inc. ("Shoe Station"). The Shoe Station assets were acquired for approximately $70.4 million, funded with cash on hand. This acquisition was the first in our history. As of our Fiscal 2022 year end, we operated 24 stores across five states in the Southeast under the Shoe Station banner, inclusive of the 21 stores acquired and three additional stores opened since the acquisition. The addition of this banner has created a complementary retail platform for us to serve a broader base of family footwear customers in both urban and suburban demographics.
Net Sales attributed to the Shoe Station banner were $99.9 million in Fiscal 2022 and $16.6 million from the acquisition date through January 29, 2022 in Fiscal 2021. The Shoe Station e-commerce website, www.shoestation.com, went live on our e-commerce platform in early February 2023. More information on the acquisition can be found in Note 3 - "Acquisition of Shoe Station" in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in PART II, ITEM 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Diversified Sales Mix
 We sell broadly across the family footwear channel, with balanced distribution among type of customer (men, women and children), product (athletics and non-athletics) and age (senior citizens to infants) with no singular reliance on any particular segment. The products we offer are a mix of footwear necessities for sport, work, daily activities and special events. The table below sets forth our percentage of sales by product category over the last five fiscal years.

Fiscal Years | 2022 | | | 2021 | | 2020 | 2019 | | 2018 | 
Non-Athletics: | | | | | | | | | |

Our Strategic Growth Initiatives
 Store Growth
 Increasing market penetration by adding new stores is as a key component of our growth strategy. We are targeting operating at least 500 stores by 2028. We believe our current store footprint provides for near-term fill-in opportunities within existing markets as well as longer-term growth to new markets within the United States. In Fiscal 2022, we opened four new stores (one Shoe Carnival store and three Shoe Station stores) within existing markets. We aim to operate approximately 10 to 20 new stores in Fiscal 2023 with additional store growth acceleration in 2024 and beyond. This increased scale will be accomplished through a combination of both organic and acquired store growth. In the near term, our focus is to primarily grow the Shoe Station banner within our existing footprint, and we aim to achieve 100 Shoe Station stores also by 2028.
Store Modernization
 As a key component to increasing comparable store sales, in Fiscal 2021 we began a multiyear project to modernize our store fleet. In Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021 our capital expenditures were $77.3 million and $31.4 million,


respectively, with a primary focus on store modernization and new stores. Our new store design is viewed as a differentiator by certain strategic vendor partners and has provided us an opportunity to increase access to branded merchandise in the near term.

As of Fiscal 2022 year end, 41% of our fleet modernization program has been completed, representing 164 of the 397 stores in our fleet. Over 60% of our fleet modernization program is expected to be completed by Fiscal 2023 year end. The entire program is expected to be completed in the Fiscal 2024 - Fiscal 2025 horizon.
 E-commerce Growth
 Our e-commerce platform is an extension of our physical stores and is designed to improve our customer’s shopping experience. We are committed to providing a personalized, seamless customer experience across all channels, and we believe that our ongoing omnichannel initiatives are aligned with rapidly changing consumer behavior.
Our customers will have new online experiences in Fiscal 2023, as we launched our www.shoestation.com website in February 2023, and we expect to relaunch our www.shoecarnival.com website later in Fiscal 2023. We have completed the technology migration for both banners to a single platform hosted by a leading provider. This marks the first major redesign of our Shoe Carnival website since 2016. We anticipate these enhancements will increase user conversion, enhance the ease of navigation and improve overall functionality compared to the legacy website design.
 We continue to expect our e-commerce platform to be a significant sales channel for us. Our goal is for our e-commerce sales channel to provide between 10% and 15% of enterprise-wide merchandise sales, versus a pre-pandemic 6% in Fiscal 2019. E-commerce sales represented approximately 10% of our merchandise sales in Fiscal 2022, 12% in Fiscal 2021 and 19% in Fiscal 2020 as impacted by changes in customer shopping behavior during the peak of the pandemic.
 Customer Relationship Management ("CRM")
 Our CRM program continues to provide valuable customer insights to our business, resulting in more efficient and effective marketing outreach. CRM provides our marketing, merchandising, analytics and real estate teams a better and more complete view of our customer’s shopping behaviors and forms the foundation of our digital marketing efforts and our Shoe Perks loyalty program (“Shoe Perks”). Our view into customer data allows us to more effectively communicate with our customers on a segmented basis through all owned and paid media channels and tailor the merchandise mix down to a store level. Through transaction data, we gain useful insights into our customers’ shopping habits, including where, when and how they shop our stores and navigate our online presence. Additionally, our CRM program allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the brands and categories that our high-value customers consistently purchase so that we can continue to meet this customer need and demand at a geographic and store level.
 Our CRM program allows us to drive customer retention by delivering to each customer more individualized shopping opportunities and experiences and aids in gaining a better understanding of our existing customer base as well as identifying new customers. We expect segmentation and activation of our high-value customers through data analysis and targeting the broader market of ‘look-a-like’ customers to continue to play a key role in our growth.
Once a customer enrolls in Shoe Perks and provides a means for digital communication, the customer will begin receiving personalized communications from us. These communications afford us additional opportunities to highlight our broad product assortment and promotions. Shoe Perks provides customers with a heightened shopping experience, which includes exclusive offers and rewards that are earned by making purchases either in-store or online and through participating in other point earning opportunities that facilitate engagement with our brand and the national name brands we offer.
We are focused on expanding our Shoe Perks enrollment. In Fiscal 2022, our Shoe Perks membership grew to 32.1 million members, representing an increase in new customers of 34% compared to pre-pandemic Fiscal 2019 year end


and 13% compared to Fiscal 2021 year end. Our Shoe Perks loyalty program members now include Shoe Station customers, which added over 1.4 million customers in Fiscal 2022.
In Fiscal 2022, purchases from Shoe Perks members were approximately 67% of our comparable Net Sales, which does not include Shoe Station activity in Fiscal 2022. We believe our Shoe Perks program affords us tremendous opportunity to communicate, build relationships and engage with our most loyal shoppers and increase our customer touch points, which we believe will result in long-term sales gains. Our most loyal customers, those who qualify for our “Gold” tier, receive additional rewards and incentives. The average transaction value for our Gold tier customers was approximately 39% higher than non-Gold tier Shoe Perks members in Fiscal 2022.
Strong and Diversified Vendor Partnerships
 In Fiscal 2022, a record number of vendors generated over $15 million in merchandise sales for us. We continued our long-term relationships with both Nike, Inc. (“Nike”) and Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (“Skechers”) and further diversified our merchandise offerings among other vendor partners. Collectively, Nike and Skechers accounted for 27% of our Net Sales in Fiscal 2022, compared to 39% in Fiscal 2021 and 43% in Fiscal 2020. Nike accounted for approximately 14% of our Net Sales in Fiscal 2022, 28% in Fiscal 2021 and 33% in Fiscal 2020, and Skechers accounted for approximately 13% of our Net Sales in Fiscal 2022, 11% in Fiscal 2021 and 10% in Fiscal 2020.
We continually work to strengthen our brand offerings and our relationships with our key vendors. While we have no long-term contracts in place with any of our vendors, we anticipate that Nike and Skechers will continue to be high-volume vendors for us in Fiscal 2023. We also anticipate increased availability of athletic product in Fiscal 2023 as athletic supply chains are expected to return to a more normal cadence.
Stable Gross Profit Margins and Operating Income Margins
 We increased our gross profit margin in Fiscal 2021 and generally maintained that margin in Fiscal 2022.
 Our promotional model is derived from insights driven by our CRM program and return on investment of our promotional strategies. We have significantly reduced broad-based promotional activity, such as “buy one-get one half off.” Our level of promotional intensity decreased by over 17% in Fiscal 2022 compared to our pre-pandemic promotional activity in Fiscal 2019.
Primarily as a result of our change in promotional strategy, our gross profit margin increased to 37.1% in Fiscal 2022 and 39.6% in Fiscal 2021 compared to a pre-pandemic level of 30.1% in Fiscal 2019. Those higher gross profit margins have generated double digit operating income margins in each of the last two fiscal years, at 11.6% in Fiscal 2022 and 15.6% in Fiscal 2021, compared to a pre-pandemic Fiscal 2019 operating income margin of 5.2% and our pre-pandemic record operating income margin of 5.8%.
Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe our financial success is due to a number of key competitive strengths that make our Shoe Carnival and Shoe Station banners destinations of choice for our family channel footwear consumer.
Digital Media to Build Brand Awareness
 Our goal is to communicate a consistent brand image for both of our banners across all aspects of our operations and throughout our marketing strategies. We highlight our banners and the name brands we carry, including specific styles of product, using lifestyle and product imagery to showcase merchandise brands. The use of digital media comprises the substantial portion of our marketing mix, particularly as we leverage data that comes directly from our customers as part of our CRM solution, allowing us to directly communicate with our core customers. Television, radio, print media (including inserts, direct mail and newspaper advertising) and outdoor advertising accounted for the balance of our total advertising budget.
Centralized Distribution Process
 Our distribution center is equipped with mechanized processing and product movement equipment. The facility utilizes cross docking/store replenishment and redistribution methods to fill store product requirements. These


methods may include count verification, price and bar code labeling of each unit (when not performed by the manufacturer), redistribution of an order into size assortments (when not performed by the manufacturer) and allocation of shipments to individual stores. Throughout packing, allocating, storing and shipping, our distribution process is essentially paperless. Merchandise is typically shipped to each store location once per week. For stores within the continental United States, a dedicated carrier, with occasional use of common carriers, handles the majority of shipments. We leverage these investments with third party managed software tailored to our specific needs to track merchandise during the transportation and distribution process. During Fiscal 2022, 92% of merchandise was received into our distribution center, with a much smaller percentage of merchandise being either directly drop shipped to customers or sent directly to a store location. Additional information about our distribution center can be found in PART I, ITEM 2, "Properties" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Disciplined Approach to Capital Management
 We remain focused on funding our normal operations without debt. We ended Fiscal 2022 with no debt and $63.0 million of Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities. Over the last five fiscal years, we have had no debt outstanding and Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities of at least $61 million at the end of each fiscal year. We believe this approach increases our ability to make impactful long-term decisions and enhances our stakeholder relationships.
Leased Stores
 Our stores can be easily found in high traffic shopping areas and are generally located in open-air shopping centers. On average, our Shoe Carnival physical stores are approximately 10,900 square feet and carry inventory of approximately 30,800 pairs of shoes per location. On average, our Shoe Station physical stores are approximately 17,800 square feet and carry an average inventory of 44,100 pairs of shoes per location. More information about our store locations and other properties can be found in PART I, ITEM 2, "Properties" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All stores are currently leased and more information on our leases can be found in Note 10 - "Leases" in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in PART II, ITEM 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Distinctive In-Store Shopping Experience
 Our in-store merchandise is displayed directly on the selling floor in an open stock format, allowing customers to serve themselves, if they choose. Our trained staff is dedicated to customer service and assists and educates customers with the features and location of merchandise, as well as finding sizes, styles and colors. Our new store design incorporates the use of digital screens that are centrally controlled and are more adaptable than printed visual in-store advertising. These digital screens further enhance the in-store shopping experience and provide another opportunity for our vendors to compete for in-store advertising. We believe our distinctive shopping experience gives us various competitive advantages, including increased multiple unit sales, the building of a loyal, repeat customer base, the creation of word-of-mouth advertising, and enhanced sell-through of in-season goods.
Broad Merchandise Assortment
Our product assortment is comprised primarily of on-trend branded footwear for the entire family and includes dress and casual shoes, sandals, boots and a wide assortment of athletic shoes. Our physical stores carry shoes in two general categories – athletics and non-athletics with subcategories for men's, women's and children's shoes, as well as a broad range of accessories. Our e-commerce platform offers customers a large assortment of products in all categories of footwear with an increased depth of sizes and colors that may not be available in all stores. Although the core merchandise assortment tends to be similar for each store, there are differences between our store banners, and to some extent, there is further differentiation by store under each banner, reflecting each store’s unique demographics and customer interests. Our knowledge of these interests, combined with our vendor relationships and distribution process, allows us to react quickly to emerging trends or special events.
Information Technology
 Our proprietary inventory management and advanced point-of-sale (“POS”) systems provide us with the timely information necessary to monitor and control all phases of operations. The POS provides, in addition to other features, full price management, promotion tracking capabilities (in support of the spontaneous nature of the in-store price


promotions), real-time sales and cost of sales by product category at the store level and customer tracking. Using the POS, both store personnel and centralized merchandising staff are able to monitor sales, cost of sales and the success of product promotions in real-time.
Our systems provide up-to-date sales and inventory information. Our data warehouse enables our merchandising and store operations staff to analyze sales, margin and inventory levels by store. Using this information, our merchandise managers meet regularly with vendors to compare product sales and margins and return on inventory investment against previously stated objectives. We believe timely access to key business data has enabled us to drive our comparable store sales, manage our markdown activity and improve inventory turnover.
 Efficient E-commerce Order Management and Fulfillment (Ship-From-Store and Vendor Drop Ship Program)
 We recently implemented a third party hosted order management system designed to our specific needs, which has enabled us to meet the complex demands of omnichannel fulfillment and has positioned us for scaling our e-commerce capabilities as we grow.
Our Ship-From-Store program is a core element of our omnichannel strategy. Online orders are primarily fulfilled using physical stores. By fulfilling e-commerce orders principally from our store level inventory and staff, we are able to minimize out-of-stocks, offer our customers an expanded online assortment and leverage store level inventory and overhead. E-commerce orders can also be fulfilled from our distribution center in Evansville, Indiana and the distribution center is used in times of peak demand.
We also maintain a vendor drop-ship program with select business partners. This program offers our customers an expanded online assortment of styles and colors that we do not carry in-store. While our customers benefit from expanded item assortment, the functionality of this program is seamless, and our customers’ online experience is not impacted by the vendor drop-ship fulfillment option. We benefit from this program by not having to make a capital investment in the expanded inventory assortment, which is carried and fulfilled by our business partners participating in this program.
Competitive Pricing For Our Customers
 Our customer is primarily a value-conscious consumer seeking name brand footwear across all ages, with our Shoe Station banner targeting a higher price point and more suburban customer. We believe that by offering a wide selection of popular styles of primarily name brand merchandise at competitive prices, we generate broad customer appeal. Additionally, the time-conscious customer appreciates the convenience of one-stop shopping for the entire family, whether this occurs at any of our store locations or through our other omnichannel choices.
Competition
 The retail footwear business is highly competitive. We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry are merchandise selection, price, fashion, quality, location, shopping environment and service. We compete with department stores, shoe stores, sporting goods stores, e-commerce retailers and mass merchandisers. We compete with most department stores and traditional shoe stores by offering competitive prices. We compete with off-price retailers, mass merchandisers and discount stores by offering a wider and deeper selection of merchandise. Many of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than we do.
Culture and Human Capital Management
 We have intentionally built an employee-centric, customer-focused organization designed to compete at the highest levels in the retail industry. Our commitment to, and investment in, a strong performance culture is paramount to our long-term sustainability and success.
Workforce Diversity
We serve a diverse customer base and seek diversity in and among our workforce in all areas, from our stores to our distribution center and our corporate offices. We are firmly committed to providing equal opportunities in all aspects of employment and believe that all individuals should be treated with respect and dignity. Diversity is an important


element in our ongoing annual mandatory training for all employees and managers. We do not tolerate harassment or unlawful discrimination of any kind.
We have clear policies encouraging strong relationships and protecting open lines of communication with management at every level. This, coupled with our non-retaliation policy, encourages employees to raise issues and seek immediate redress of those issues if they should arise.
We understand the value of diversity at all levels, whether of gender, race, ethnicity, background or experience. As of our Fiscal 2022 year end, our workforce identified as 64% female and 36% male. Our broad-based leadership team, including those who manage and lead our stores and those who lead our Company, identified as 60% female and 40% male. With respect to ethnicity, our leadership team identified as 64% Caucasian and 36% non-Caucasian. The diversity of our leadership team trends with the diversity of our customer base, which based on recent data from our Shoe Perks customer loyalty program, approximates 70% Caucasian and 30% African American, Hispanic or Asian and is more female than male.
 In our corporate leadership roles (senior director-level employees through our named executive officers), the percentage identifying as female has significantly increased over the last five years from 5% to 18% with several departments, such as human resources, merchandising and technology, being led by those that identify as female.
 We are also focused on the diversity of our Board. Currently, two of four (50%) of our non-employee Board members and two of seven of our total Board identify as female. We are continuing to refresh our Board and assess long-term succession as well as the diversity of the Board’s collective skill set. Over the last three years, three board members have transitioned, creating opportunity for new directors who have enhanced our diversity.
 
Retention
 We believe our employee-centric culture not only supports higher levels of execution and performance, but also has led to increased retention of key talent. During the height of the pandemic when other retailers furloughed or laid off employees, we took a different route, finding innovative ways to retain and pay our full-time associates. We believe this decision had a positive impact on our employees and the communities we serve. This decision also allowed for us to reopen quickly to meet the in-store needs of our customer base and other stakeholders.
Our store-level training programs provide the foundation for long-term careers and our ability to promote from within. We support the first-time jobs for many of our associates where they gain workforce experiences that may grow into long-term careers.
 Currently, all of the general managers who operate our Shoe Carnival bannered stores and 90% of our district managers who oversee those general managers were trained, developed and promoted from within. As of our Fiscal 2022 year end, of our 33 district managers across both banners, 61% have been employed by us for more than 20 years. The average tenure of the general managers who operate our Shoe Carnival and Shoe Station bannered stores was 14 years as of Fiscal 2022 year end.
Individuals who comprise our leadership team, which includes our named executive officers, vice presidents and senior director-level employees, have been employed by Shoe Carnival or Shoe Station for an average of 19 years.
Employee Benefits
 Among the many ways we seek to serve our employees, we offer a complete range of benefits. These include competitive wages and incentives; an employee stock purchase plan with a discount off the fair value of our common stock; employer-subsidized medical plans with dental and vision benefits; qualified and unqualified defined contribution plans with employer matching contributions; and merchandise discounts, among other benefits.
Training and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
 We are dedicated to strengthening our culture and execution through ongoing training for all associates. We are uniquely focused on training within our store-level, customer-facing operations. Employees must obtain necessary


certifications in order to be responsible for the keys to a store and eventually to become a general manager. Our broad-based training program also engages and educates our employees on the following key topics:
 •Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Ethics”);
 •Non-discrimination and anti-harassment;
 •Cybersecurity awareness and responsibility; and
 •Supply chain security.
 More information regarding our approach to conducting business responsibly, including our guidelines on discrimination and harassment, can be found in our Code of Ethics. Our Code of Ethics applies to all of our Board members, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, our principal financial officer and our principal accounting officer.
 Our Code of Ethics is posted on our website at investors.shoecarnival.com/governance/governance-documents. We intend to disclose any amendments to the Code of Ethics by posting such amendments on our website. In addition, any waivers of the Code of Ethics for our Board members or executive officers will be disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Safety of our Employees and Security of our Data
 We strive to provide our associates with a safe and healthy work environment. We measure OSHA recordable incidents to gauge the success of our safety protocol. During calendar year 2022, we recorded 71 non COVID-related OSHA recordable incidents, an approximate 7% reduction in incidents compared to five years ago. Excluding the Shoe Station operations, which continue to be integrated into our safety culture, the decrease compared to five years ago was 20%.
 Our strategies to address the ever-expanding complexities of protecting customer and employee data and executing our business strategies in an increasingly digital world continue to advance. Our technology department monitors and regularly tests compliance with our protocols, provides regular updates to employees and management and conducts annual training.
 
Number of Employees
 As of our Fiscal 2022 year end, we had approximately 5,500 employees, of which approximately 3,000 were employed on a part-time basis. The number of employees fluctuates during the year primarily due to seasonality. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
Seasonality
 For a discussion of the impact of seasonality on our operating results and our business, see PART II, ITEM 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of Store Count and Seasonality on Quarterly Results.”
Trademarks
 We own the following federally registered trademarks and service marks: Shoe Carnival® and associated trade dress and related logos, Y-NOT?®, UNR8ED®, Solanz®, Shoe Perks®, SC Work Wear®, A Surprise In Store®, Shoes 2U®, Laces for Learning®, Princess Lacey’s Laces®, Shoe Station®, Shoe Station Super Store® and Shoe Station Select®. We believe these marks are valuable and, accordingly, we intend to maintain the marks and the related registrations. We are not aware of any pending claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use these marks.
Environmental
 We seek to minimize our impact on the environment and reduce our carbon footprint by actively implementing environmentally-friendly processes throughout our business, including energy efficiency initiatives, waste minimization and the use of recycled materials within our supply chain. Our most significant areas of focus are fuel


and packaging material used to deliver merchandise to our distribution center and stores; the HVAC and lighting systems in our stores, distribution center and corporate office; and recycling methods.
Compliance with current federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We anticipate no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for our current fiscal year or for the near future.
