Item 1. Business
Background
 CACI International Inc was founded in 1962 as a simulation technology company and has grown into an international information solutions and services provider.  CACI serves 12 markets for which we provide domain expertise, solutions and services to meet enterprise and mission needs.  
CACI International Inc was organized in Delaware on October 8, 1985 and is a holding company whose operations are conducted through subsidiaries, which are located in the U.S. and Europe.
 For the year ended June 30, 2019 (FY2019), we generated $5.0 billion of revenue from our contracts with customers in the U.S. federal government and commercial markets, primarily in North America, as well as in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and the Netherlands. As a result of our diverse capabilities and customer mission understanding, many of our customer relationships have existed for over 20 years.
 Our proven solutions and services and strong record of program delivery have enabled us to compete for and secure new customers and new contracts, win repeat business, and build and maintain long-term customer relationships. We seek competitive business opportunities and have built our operations to support major programs through a market-focused business development organization.
 Our primary customers are agencies and departments of the U.S. government. Our information solutions and services support national security missions and government modernization/transformation for intelligence, defense, and federal civilian customers.  The demand for our solutions and services, in large measure, is created by the increasingly complex network, systems, and information environments in which governments and businesses operate, and by the need to stay current with emerging technology while increasing productivity, enhancing security, and, ultimately, improving performance.
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “we”, “our”, “the Company” and “CACI” as used in Parts I, II and III include CACI International Inc and its subsidiaries and ventures that are majority-owned or otherwise controlled by it. The term “the Registrant” as used in Parts I, II and III refers to CACI International Inc only.
 Overview
 At June 30, 2019, we had approximately 22,100 employees.
 Domestic Operations
 Our domestic operations account for 100 percent of our U.S. government revenue and 32.6 percent of our commercial and other revenue.

International Operations
 Our international operations are conducted primarily through our operating subsidiaries in Europe, CACI Limited and CACI BV, and account for substantially all revenue generated from international customers and 67.4 percent of our commercial and other revenue.  Headquartered in London, our international operations provide a diverse mix of IT services and proprietary data and software products, serving commercial and government customers throughout the U.K., continental Europe and around the world.  
Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive industry that includes many firms, some of which are larger in size and have greater financial resources than we do. We obtain much of our business on the basis of proposals submitted in response to requests from potential and current customers, who may also receive proposals from other firms. Non-traditional players have entered the market and have established positions related to such areas as cloud computing, cyber, satellite operations, business systems and healthcare IT. Additionally, we face indirect competition from certain government agencies that perform services for themselves similar to those marketed by us. We know of no single competitor that is dominant in our fields of technology. We have a relatively small share of the available worldwide market for our solutions and services and intend to achieve growth and increase market share both organically and through strategic acquisitions.
Strengths and Strategy
 We offer substantially our entire range of solutions and services and proprietary products to defense, intelligence and civilian agencies of the U.S. government. Our work for U.S. government agencies may combine a wide range of skills drawn from our solutions, services and product offerings. We also contract through our international operations to supply solutions, services and/or products to governments of other nations. As with other government contractors, our business is subject to government customer funding decisions and actions that are beyond our control.
 Although we are a supplier of proprietary computer-based technology products and marketing systems products, we are not primarily focused on being a software product developer-distributor (see discussion following under “Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Licenses”).
 Our international commercial customer base consists primarily of large enterprises in the U.K.  This market is the primary target of our proprietary marketing systems software, and database products and consultancy services. Commercial bids are frequently negotiated as to terms and conditions for schedule, specifications, delivery and payment.

In order to effectively perform on our existing customer contracts and secure new customer contracts within the U.S. government, we must maintain expert knowledge of agency policies, operations and challenges. We combine this comprehensive knowledge with significant expertise in the design, integration, development and implementation of advanced information solutions and services. This capability provides us with opportunities either to compete directly for, or to support other bidders in competition for multi-million dollar and multi-year award contracts from the U.S. government.
 We have strategic business relationships with a number of companies associated with the information technology industry. These strategic partners have business objectives compatible with ours and offer products and services that complement ours. We intend to continue development of these kinds of relationships wherever they support our growth objectives.
 Our marketing and new business development is conducted by many of our officers and managers including the Chief Executive Officer, executive officers, vice presidents and division managers. We employ marketing professionals who identify and qualify major contract opportunities, primarily in the federal government market.
 Much of our business is won through submission of formal competitive bids. Government and commercial customers typically base their decisions regarding contract awards on their assessment of the quality of past performance, responsiveness to proposal requirements, price, and other factors. The terms, conditions and form of contract of government bids, however, are in most cases specified by the customer. In situations in which the customer-imposed contract type and/or terms appear to expose us to inappropriate risk or do not offer us a sufficient financial return, we may seek alternate arrangements or opt not to bid for the work. Essentially all contracts with the U.S. government, and many contracts with other government entities, permit the government customer to terminate the contract at any time for the convenience of the government or for default by the contractor. Although we operate under the risk that such terminations may occur and have a material impact on operations, such terminations have been rare and, generally, have not materially affected operations.
 Our contracts and subcontracts are composed of a wide range of contract types, including firm fixed-price, cost reimbursement, time-and-materials, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) and government wide acquisition contracts (known as GWACS) such as General Services Administration (GSA) schedule contracts. By company policy, significant fixed-price contracts require the approval of at least two of our senior officers.
 In FY2019, the top ten revenue-producing contracts, many of which consist of many task orders, accounted for 30.7 percent of our revenue, or $1.5 billion.
 Industry Trends
 Budgetary Environment
 In the U.S. government’s Fiscal Year (GFY) 2019, discretionary spending is expected to be approximately $1.3 trillion. Based on the analysis of an independent market consultant retained by the Company, we believe that the addressable market for our offerings is approximately $221 billion and is expected to continue to grow over the next several years. Approximately 70 percent of our revenue comes from defense-related customers, including those in the Intelligence Community (IC), with additional revenue coming from non-defense IC, homeland security, and other federal civilian customers. As a result of the two-year Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018), appropriations for the Department of Defense (DoD), including those for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), for GFY 2018 and GFY 2019 increased 10 percent and 2 percent, respectively. 
 We carefully follow federal budget, legislative and contracting trends and activities and evolve our strategies to take these into consideration. In late July 2019, Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (BBA 2019), which increased the caps for defense and non-defense spending for GFY 2020 and GFY 2021, established discretionary spending caps for GFY 2020 and GFY 2021, and suspended the national debt limit through July 2021. On August 2, 2019, the President signed the measure into law. While Congress has yet to determine the final allocations for the 12 appropriation bills for GFY 2020, bipartisan support remains for continued investment in the areas of defense and national security. Specifically, the BBA 2019 calls for defense spending, including OCO funds, of $738 billion in GFY 2020 and $740.5 billion in GFY 2021. Both represent increases from GFY 2019 levels of $716 billion. 
 7

Until September 30, 2021, the U.S. Government is operating under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA). This law established limits on discretionary spending, reducing planned defense spending by a minimum of $487 billion over a 10-year period that began at the end of GFY 2012. In addition, the BCA included a sequester mechanism that imposed additional defense cuts of $500 billion, or approximately 9 percent, over nine years starting in GFY 2013 if the Congress did not identify a means to reduce the U.S. deficit by $1.2 trillion. Because these means were not identified, the sequester mechanism took effect in March 2013. Since the beginning of sequestration in March 2013, there have been five laws enacted that have extended the automatic direct spending reductions beyond the GFY 2021, the most recent of which was the BBA 2019. As a result of the BBA 2019, the sequester mechanism instituted by the BCA has been eliminated for the remaining two government fiscal years covered by that law.
 During those periods of time when appropriations bills have not been passed and signed into law, government agencies operate under a continuing resolution (CR). During GFY 2019, from December 8 to December 21, 2018, the nine Cabinet departments and dozens of smaller agencies whose appropriations bills were not passed operated under a CR. If by September 30, 2019, Congress does not complete its budget process for GFY 2020, it must pass a CR to keep the government operating beyond that date. Depending on their scope, duration, and other factors, CRs can negatively impact our business due to delays in new program starts, delays in contract award decisions, and other factors. We continuously review our operations in an attempt to identify programs potentially at risk from CRs so that we can consider appropriate contingency plans. 
 When federal agencies and programs lack either appropriated or interim funding, they must cease operations, or shutdown, except in certain emergency situations or when the law authorizes continued activity. Government shutdowns necessitate furloughs of several hundred thousand federal employees, require cessation or reduction of many government activities, and affect numerous sectors of the economy. From December 22, 2018 to January 25, 2019, the aforementioned nine departments and dozens of smaller agencies were shutdown. On January 25, 2019, the President signed into law a short-term measure that ended the shutdown and funded the government through February 15, 2019. On February 15, 2019, the President signed into law an omnibus appropriations bill that funded for the remainder of GFY 2019 the nine Cabinet departments and dozens of smaller agencies that were affected by the government shutdown. The 35-day government shutdown that ended in January 2019 did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019.
 Market Environment
 Across our addressable market, we strive to address our customers’ most critical needs, supporting both the successful execution of their mission and the efficient operation of their enterprise. During our FY2019, we continued to align the Company’s capabilities with well-funded budget priorities and took steps to maintain a competitive cost structure in line with our expectations of future business opportunities. In light of these actions, as well as the budgetary environment discussed above, we believe we are well positioned to win new business in our large addressable market. We believe that the following trends will influence the USG’s spending in our addressable market:

● | A favorable USG budget environment, particularly in defense and intelligence-related areas;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A shift in focus from readiness toward increased capabilities, effectiveness, and responsiveness;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increased USG interest in faster contracting and acquisition processes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increased focus on defensive cyber, space and the electromagnetic spectrum as key domains for National Security;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Balanced focus on enterprise cost reductions through efficiency, with increased spend on infrastructure modernization and enhancements to cyber security protections; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increased investments in advanced technologies (e.g., Artificial Intelligence, 5G).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The demand for faster acquisitions is outpacing traditional methodologies and we believe this will benefit those that can provide agility, speed and innovation to address requirements. USG investments in advanced technologies and innovation ecosystems are likely to accelerate adoption into operational systems.
 We believe the USG will continue to seek spending reductions in core enterprise services through improved operational efficiency, technology adoption, automation, and performance-based-contracting. This is balanced by increased investments in modernizing enterprise enabling applications using agile methodologies, development, security and operations (DevSecOps) driven synergies between development and operations, integrated security services, and an increase in adoption of contemporary technology including Cloud, robotic process automation (RPA), data analytics, and transparent automated workflow. We expect to see a steady stream of funding for these types of transformational activities that yield results in a shorter timeframe while providing more stable, secure and predictable information systems.

The increased focus on cyber security, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum is increasing opportunities in the Electronic Warfare marketplace, driving toward modernization and innovation. Counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and counter proliferation also remain at the forefront of U.S. security concerns. The world is increasingly interconnected and interdependent. Instability can arise quickly and spread rapidly beyond borders. This phenomenon is readily apparent in events in the Pacific Rim, the Middle East and North Africa, and can create both opportunities and challenges as the contractor community adapts to the changing needs of Defense, Intelligence, Homeland Security, State, and U.S. partners. As the U.S. military advantage continues to be challenged, the need for intelligence and surveillance of potential adversaries of all types will continue or grow. Funding to support the use of military and intelligence assets, particularly special operating forces, to combat these threats is expected to remain stable or increase. Mission requirements continue to accelerate needs for agility, speed, flexibility and configurability to address the rapidly changing threat profile. 
 As companies strive to expand and increase market share by acquiring other companies, there is increasing competition for acquisition candidates. Companies providing cyber, electronic warfare, data analytics and advanced technology solutions are in particularly high demand.
 Customer Procurement Environment
 The USG continues to change the manner in which it purchases goods and services. The aspects of these changes that are most relevant to us are as follows:

● | The use of time and material and sole-source contracts is now greatly reduced. The use of award fees is diminishing. In addition, more scrutiny is being placed on the amount of fee bid on cost reimbursable type contracts;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Multiple award contract vehicles are being used at an increasing rate. Bidding and winning these types of contract vehicles does not ensure that revenue will follow since task orders under the vehicle are also competed; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fees for subcontract management are being limited such that the prime assumes more of the risk for its subcontractor relationships.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that our customers' use of lowest price/technically acceptable (LPTA) procurements, which contributed to pricing pressures in prior years, has moderated. We also continue to see protests of major contract awards and delays in USG procurement activities. In addition, many of our federal government contracts require us to employ personnel with security clearances, specific levels of education and specific past work experience. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain and competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense. Additional factors that could affect USG spending in our addressable market include changes in set-asides for small businesses and budgetary priorities limiting or delaying federal government spending in general.
 Recent Acquisitions
 During the past three fiscal years, we completed a total of nine acquisitions, including:
  
● | On June 1, 2019 CACI Limited acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Mood Enterprises Limited, a United Kingdom company that provides software and managed services to defense, national security and commercial organizations.

Seasonal Nature of Business
 Our business in general is not seasonal, although the summer and holiday seasons affect our revenue because of the impact of holidays and vacations on our labor and on product and service sales by our international operations. Variations in our business also may occur at the expiration of major contracts until such contracts are renewed or new business is obtained.
 The U.S. government’s fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year. It is not uncommon for government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of a fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended funds. Moreover, in years when the U.S. government does not complete the budget process for the next fiscal year before the end of September, government operations whose appropriations legislation has not been signed into law are funded under a continuing resolution that authorizes them to continue to operate but traditionally does not authorize new spending initiatives.
 CACI Employment and Benefits
 Our employees are our most valuable resource. We are in continuing competition for highly skilled professionals in virtually all of our business areas. The success and growth of our business is significantly correlated with our ability to recruit, train, promote and retain high quality people at all levels of the organization. For these reasons, we endeavor to maintain competitive salary structures, incentive compensation programs, fringe benefits, opportunities for growth, and individual recognition and award programs. Fringe benefits are generally consistent across our subsidiaries, and include: paid time off for vacations, sick leave, and holidays; medical, dental, disability and life insurance; tuition reimbursement for job-related education and training; and other benefits under various retirement savings and stock purchase plans. 
 We have published policies that set high standards for the conduct of our business. We require all of our employees, independent contractors working on customer engagements, officers, and directors annually to execute and affirm to the code of ethics applicable to their activities. In addition, we require annual ethics and compliance training for all of our employees to provide them with the knowledge necessary to maintain our high standards of ethics and compliance.
 Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Licenses
 Generally, our solutions and services are not substantially dependent upon obtaining or maintaining intellectual property protections, although our operations make use of such protections and benefit from them as discriminators in competition. The Company owns patents and claims copyright, trademark and other proprietary rights in a variety of intellectual property, including each of our proprietary computer software and data products and the related documentation. We also maintain a number of trade secrets that contribute to our success and competitive distinction and endeavor to accord such trade secrets protection adequate to ensure their continuing availability to us.
 Our proprietary information is protected through a combination of contractual arrangements with our employees and third parties and intellectual property laws. From time to time, we are required to assert our rights against former employees or other third parties who attempt to misappropriate our proprietary and confidential information. Although we are not materially dependent on the protection of our intellectual property, we take such matters seriously and pursue claims against such individuals to the extent necessary to adequately protect our rights.
 As a systems integrator, it is important that we maintain access to software, data and other products supplied by third parties and we continue to enter into agreements that give us the right to distribute and receive income from third party software, data and other products that serve our customers. The durations of such agreements are negotiated and vary according to the terms of the agreements.

Backlog
 The Company’s backlog represents total value on our existing contracts that has the potential to be recognized into revenue as work is performed.  The Company includes unexercised option years in its backlog amount and excludes task orders that may be issued underneath a multiple award IDIQ vehicle until such task orders are awarded.  
 The Company’s backlog as of period end is either funded or unfunded:
  
● | Funded backlog represents contract value appropriated by a customer that is expected to be recognized into revenue.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unfunded backlog represents the sum of unappropriated contract value on executed contracts and unexercised option years that is expected to be recognized into revenue.

 As of June 30, 2019, the Company had total backlog of $16.9 billion, of which $2.9 billion was funded.  The total backlog consists of remaining performance obligations (see Note 11, Revenue Recognition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) plus unexercised options.  
 There is no assurance that all funded or potential contract value will result in revenue being recognized.  The Company continues to monitor our backlog as it is subject to change from execution of new contracts, contract modifications or extensions, government deobligations, or early terminations.  Based on this analysis, an adjustment to the period end balance may be required.
