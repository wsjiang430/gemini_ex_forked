Item 1.    Business
Business Overview
Rimini Street, Inc. and its subsidiaries (referred to as “Rimini Street”, the “Company”, “we” and “us”) are global providers of end-to-end enterprise software support, products and services. The Company offers a comprehensive family of unified solutions to run, manage, support, customize, configure, connect, protect, monitor, and optimize clients’ enterprise application, database, and technology software platforms. 
Rimini Street, Inc. was formed in the State of Nevada in 2005 (“RSI” or “predecessor”) and, through a merger in 2017 with a public company, became Rimini Street, Inc., a Delaware corporation, trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol “RMNI.”
We founded Rimini Street to disrupt and redefine the enterprise software support market by developing and delivering innovative new solutions that filled a then-unmet need in the enterprise software market. We became and remain the leading independent software support provider for Oracle and SAP products based on both the number of active clients supported and recognition by industry analyst firms.
Over the years, as our reputation for technical capability, value, innovation, responsiveness and trusted reliability grew, clients and prospects began asking us to expand the scope of our support, product and service offerings to meet other current and evolving needs and opportunities related to their enterprise software. We also heard from prospects and clients that their goals include reducing the number of IT vendors to more manageable numbers from a governance perspective, with a desire to select vendors who can provide a wider scope of IT services and become true trusted partners.
To meet the needs of our clients and prospects and to service what we believe is a significantly expanded addressable market opportunity, we designed, developed and are now delivering a new, expanded solutions portfolio (our “Solutions Portfolio”) for a wider array of enterprise software – including an expanded list of supported software; managed services for Oracle, SAP, IBM, Salesforce and open-source database software; and new solutions for security, interoperability, observability and consulting. We also now offer an integrated package of our services as Rimini ONE™, a unique end-to-end, “turnkey” outsourcing option for Oracle and SAP landscapes designed to optimize our clients’ existing technologies with a minimum of 15 extended years of operating lifespan and enable our clients to focus their IT talent and budget on potentially higher-value, innovative projects that will support competitive advantage and growth.

Rimini ONE™ is our service program designed to offer a comprehensive set of unified, integrated services to run, manage, support, customize, configure, connect, protect, monitor, and optimize our clients’ application, database, and technology enterprise software. We believe Rimini ONE will provide clients with a comprehensive, unified “turnkey” service solution that can completely outsource their entire application, database, and technology infrastructure – all at a competitive, predictable cost and delivered by ONE trusted partner. 
Rimini Support™ is our award-winning, mission-critical support for Oracle, SAP, proprietary and open-source database, and technology software – delivered 24x7x365 with service level agreements (“SLAs”) providing 10-minute guaranteed support time. We extended the global availability of our award-winning, mission-critical, 24x7x365 support services beyond proprietary databases to leading open-source database platforms, including, but not limited to, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
Rimini Manage™ is our suite of managed services for application and database software (known in the industry as application management services “AMS”) delivered by highly-skilled engineers, featuring unlimited service ticket requests and industry-leading SLAs that we believe can resolve IT staffing/skill shortages and provide smoother system operations at optimized cost. Rimini Manage permits us to “run” our clients’ systems for them day-to-day with an integrated application management and support services solution provided by a single trusted vendor. 
Rimini Protect™ is our suite of innovative managed security solutions for applications, databases and technology infrastructure that is designed to be able to block newly identified attack vectors in minutes without any code changes to the software being protected; providing clients the ability to quickly protect their systems and data rather than risk remaining exposed potentially for weeks, months, or longer waiting for a solution from what we believe are dated, traditional vendor patching models that are typically not as responsive. As a pivotal part of a “defense-in-depth strategy,” Rimini Protect operates in conjunction with a client’s current security solutions and capabilities, while enhancing and strengthening the protection of the application stack. Utilizing advanced, real-time, active security controls, Rimini Protect is designed to monitor, remediate, and secure malicious application stack activity including the attempted exploitation of known and unknown vulnerabilities. 
Rimini Connect™ is our suite of managed interoperability solutions for browsers, operating systems, and email systems that we believe can enable continued utilization of and integration with existing software and infrastructure without the need for expensive system and software upgrades and migrations. For example, our patented Rimini Connect for Browsers allows certain new browsers that are incompatible with HTML messaging being sent by some applications to connect to those applications using our “universal translator.” In addition, Rimini Connect for OS supports new versions of operating systems that may be uncertified or incompatible for use with a particular software application version or release. The Rimini Connect for Email solution supports multiple new authentication and email protocols designed to promote seamless integration with existing email systems. 
Rimini Watch™ is our suite of observability solutions that include monitoring and system health check solutions designed to monitor the performance and execution of thousands of processes continuously 24x7x365 and identify potential issues before they happen so system downtime and impacts can be avoided. With Rimini Watch, we believe our clients will benefit from the predictability and confidence that their critical business applications are continuously monitored and will stay up and running, that problem resolution will be reduced through root cause analysis and that changes will be managed and documented.
Rimini Consult™ is our suite of professional services available for clients’ enterprise software customization, configuration, implementation, integration, interoperability, migration, staff augmentation and other project needs and delivered by experienced professionals. Rimini Consult also provides specialized advisory services, software resources planning, development services and technology and application roadmap planning designed to help clients successfully complete digital transformation and other innovation initiatives. 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed over 1,920 professionals and supported 3,020 active clients globally, including 75 Fortune 500 companies and 17 Fortune Global 100 companies, across a broad range of industries. We define an active client as a distinct entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a business unit of a company that purchases our services to support a specific product. For example, we count as two separate active client instances in circumstances where we provide support for two different products to the same entity. We market and sell our services globally, primarily through our direct sales force, and currently have wholly-owned subsidiaries in Australia, Brazil, UAE (Dubai), France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Our subscription-based revenue provides a strong foundation for, and visibility into, future period results. We generated revenue of $409.7 million, $374.4 million and $326.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of 9% and 15% for 2022 and 2021, respectively. We have a history of losses, and as of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $228.3 million. We recorded a net loss of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and we recorded net income of $75.2 million and $11.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We generated approximately 53%, 53% and 59% of our revenue in the United States and approximately 47%, 47% and 41% of our revenue from our international business for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Our Industry
We compete in the global IT services market for enterprise software support, products and services. We believe several major trends are shaping the IT services and support industry, impacting the manner in which businesses engage with service providers and creating significant sales and service needs that Rimini Street’s Solutions Portfolio can fulfill. 
Growth in hybrid IT environments
Today, we believe many organizations are defining business-driven roadmaps that better enable competitive advantage and growth by combining different software under perpetual, subscription and open-source licenses into an integrated business platform that is deployed across their own systems and cloud providers, commonly referred to as “hybrid IT” environments. We also believe that for many of these organizations, the cost of operating and supporting their hybrid IT environments consumes too many financial and labor resources, potentially preventing the strategic investment that is needed to compete effectively, grow revenue and improve margins.
We believe that most IT organizations operate, manage, and support hybrid, multivendor IT environments. Hybrid IT is presented in a variety of ways including cloud and locally hosted hybrid IT, hybrid licensing, hybrid support, or a hybrid IT strategy. As a result, IT services have become more complex. Most enterprises still organize service and support around products and vendors, yet the complexity of a hybrid environment can put enterprises at risk of overwhelming their existing IT service model’s ability to deliver high-quality, timely results. For example, multiple service levels that span cloud vendors and partners could mean longer service times in a vendor-based support model. Another example is the challenge of strategic solutioning across vendors that each have their own roadmaps and evolution timelines. 
Success with a hybrid IT environment can be achieved with a unified approach to services. We believe that businesses can address the complexity of a hybrid IT environment by consolidating services and support with a limited number of service-providers. This IT service modernization strategy leverages simplicity to help improve service quality, scalability, and delivery speed. It also positions IT to be more strategic and helps improve business outcomes.
To meet this need, we believe that IT service providers must be able to expand their offerings and thereby limit the disruption that can occur when multiple vendors and partners are involved in operating, managing, and supporting the technology portfolio. Scaling digital solutions successfully, for example, depends on the ability to make seamless service and support handoffs between services. When multiple IT service providers do work together, they must minimize accountability issues that can occur with multiple vendors when using a hybrid IT model. 
The desire for business-control in IT roadmaps
We believe enterprise software vendors have historically been the primary providers of software support services for their products, enabling such vendors to dictate which products and releases are supported and for how long, the scope of support services offered, service levels, terms and pricing. We also believe the lack of credible competitors of any scale other than the enterprise software vendors left software licensees with little choice but to agree to the software vendors’ terms of service, or risk potential tax, legal and regulatory non-compliance or failures of critical systems that require knowledge and skill sets beyond a licensee’s own abilities to resolve. Some software vendor support customers may be required to perform expensive and disruptive upgrades to newer product releases - even if they find no business value in doing so - just to remain eligible to receive full support.
We believe enterprises are steadily increasing their use of open-source databases, which have now surpassed commercial databases in popularity according to DB-Engines, in order to save on license and support costs, speed time to results, and avoid complex license compliance issues. We believe there is a gap in open-source database support sufficient and reliable enough for enterprises. Trial-and-error self-support and open-source community support are generally insufficient to 
-3-


allow IT organizations to meet service-level requirements of business applications or to bring non-production workloads under their administration. We further believe enterprises seek help in navigating how to migrate parts of their enterprise software portfolio to open-source software and in supporting the resulting hybrid environment.
We believe that application management services (AMS) for enterprise software is a large market with significant unmet needs in client satisfaction and value. Traditional AMS providers compete on price, but the traditional AMS model is broken with a focus on a “land and expand” model based on initially cheaper, less-skilled workers that frequently leads to higher costs, poor client satisfaction and potential degradation in service over time. Providers may under-bid contracts with the goal to grow revenue through scope expansion by adding hours to open tickets or selling new project work. These lower-cost AMS support models seem cost-effective, but their contractual structures can both enable and incent traditional AMS providers to maximize their own revenue at their clients’ expense by “addressing” issues (sometimes neither quickly nor efficiently), but not necessarily resolving them or their root causes. In addition, traditional AMS offerings are often disparate and separate from software vendor support, with inherent inefficiencies and gaps that further limit responsiveness, root cause analysis and business value.
We believe that businesses are pursuing and adopting new, next-generation enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system strategies, architectures and technologies referred to collectively as “composable ERP” by leading industry analysts. We believe composable ERP can provide organizations with greater systems flexibility and business agility to respond and meet current and future needs. We believe we are helping clients achieve the business benefits of composable ERP with a unique Rimini Street Smart Path™ solution that leverages their current ERP system investment as the foundation for a modern composable ERP architecture that is designed to enable the seamless integration of new software components and capabilities from a variety of software vendors. In a composable ERP strategy, we believe that businesses can take advantage of a modular functionality approach by selecting a mix of best-of-breed vendors, products and technologies to achieve their strategic, financial and operational goals - instead of being confined to the architecture, technology, products and capabilities of a single ERP software vendor like SAP or Oracle. 
Traditional IT service offerings not meeting full and evolving client needs 
Enterprise software support, products and services is one of the largest categories of overall global information technology (“IT”) spending. We believe ERP, customer relationship management (“CRM”), product lifecycle management (“PLM”) database and technology software platforms have become increasingly important in the operation of mission-critical business processes over the last 30 years, and also that the costs associated with failure, downtime, security exposure and maintaining the tax, legal and regulatory compliance of these core software systems have also increased. As a result, we believe that licensees often view software support as a mandatory cost of doing business. 
In a traditional licensing model, the customer typically procures a perpetual software license and pays for the license in a single upfront fee (“perpetual license”), and base software support services can be optionally procured from the software vendor for an annual fee that is typically 20-23% of the total cost of the software license. In a newer subscription-based licensing model, such as software as a service (“SaaS”), the customer generally pays as it goes for the usage of the software on a monthly or annual basis (“subscription license”). Under a subscription license, the product license and a base level of software support are generally bundled together as a single purchase, and the base level of software support is not procured separately nor is it an optional purchase.
The result is recurring and highly profitable revenue streams for enterprise software vendors. For example, for fiscal year 2022, SAP reported that support revenue represented approximately 39% of its total revenue and, for fiscal year 2022, Oracle reported a margin of 83% for cloud services and license support. 
In our experience, the base level of software support provided by enterprise software vendors for both perpetual licenses and subscription licenses has traditionally been delivered through call centers and generally includes the right to receive and use product support services, software bug fixes, and functional, technical, tax, legal and regulatory updates. In both licensing models, software support also generally includes the right to receive and use new releases of the licensed products, if and when made available. Base software support provided by enterprise software vendors for both models generally excludes other important, commonly needed enterprise services, such as support for interoperability, security, software performance, how-to questions, add-ons and customizations. Some enterprise software vendors do not include major new releases in the base support services, and instead, they charge additional license fees for such releases.
For all these reasons and others, we believe the software products and services historically offered by software vendors, such as IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP, do not meet the full and evolving needs of their customers across perpetual, subscription and open-source software, and are often more costly than alternatives. We further believe that disparate AMS

offerings from other managed service providers are disconnected from the needs of enterprises and promote incremental costs and inefficiencies. The product, service and cost gaps have created a significant market opportunity for our unique portfolio of solutions for software support and management to meet the underserved needs of enterprise software licensees at a value-driven price point.
 Our Solutions
Our subscription and fee-based software services offer enterprise software licensees a choice of solutions that replace or supplement the support products and services offered by enterprise software vendors for their products, as well as products and services offered by system integrators and other software service firms. We believe features, service levels, service breadth, technology and pricing differentiate our software products and services from our competitors. We also believe clients utilize our portfolio of software support products and services to facilitate achieving their strategic, operational, and financial objectives.
Our clients often first replace vendor support and leverage our comprehensive support for their licensed software and customizations, along with tax, legal, and regulatory updates for their specific applications and locales. A growing number of our clients then expand their service contracts with us, utilizing our application management services, database management services, security solutions, integration and interoperability capabilities, advanced strategic technology advisory services, and project-based professional services. By utilizing Rimini Street’s expanded portfolio of unified solutions, we believe our clients can achieve substantial cost savings; achieve better business outcomes; obtain support for their customized software that is not generally covered under the enterprise software vendor’s service offerings; enhance their software functionality, capabilities, and data usage; integrate and protect their systems and extend the life of their existing software releases and products. 
Our products and services seek to enable our clients to keep their mission-critical systems operating smoothly and to remain in tax, legal and regulatory compliance; improve productivity; and better allocate limited budgets, labor and other resources to investments that potentially provide competitive advantage and support growth.
The following table summarizes and compares the software support features of our Rimini Support solution to what management believes in its experience are the typical features of competing support offerings from enterprise software vendors:

When we provide our Rimini Support solutions for a perpetual software license, we generally offer our clients service for a fee that is equal to approximately 50% of the annual fees charged by the software vendor for their base support. When providing supplemental software support for a perpetual license, where the client procures our support service in addition to retaining the software vendor’s base support, we generally offer our clients service for a fee that is equal to approximately 25% of the annual fees charged by the software vendor for their base support. We also offer a special support service, Rimini Street Extra Secure Support, available to clients that require a more rigorous level of security background checks and/or government security clearance for engineers accessing a client’s system than our standard employment security background check and requirements. Clients may be asked to pay an additional fee for Rimini Street Extra Secure Support. 
We also offer additional support, products and services through our Rimini Manage, Rimini Protect, Rimini Connect, Rimini Watch and Rimini Consult solutions at an additional fee. Subscriptions for additional solutions are designed to meet specific client needs and are designed to provide what we believe is exceptional value and return for the fees charged. 
Since our inception over 17 years ago, we have invested significant resources in developing our proprietary knowledge, software tools and processes to meet the growing needs of our clients. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we delivered more than 57,000 tax, legal and regulatory updates to our global client base. We believe that we offer the most comprehensive scope of tax, legal and regulatory research available from a single vendor, including collecting and analyzing information from more than 5,300 government sites, close to 3,500 information sources and over 26,000 localities for 145 countries. We utilize a certified triple-scope verification process that involves multiple third parties such as premier subject matter experts including industry associations as well as accounting, consulting and law firms. Our capabilities are enabled by our proprietary data capture, management and analysis tool and ISO 9001:2015-based management system processes that we believe provide us with a significant competitive advantage.
We believe that we have product and service advantages that will benefit our clients. Our key strengths include:
Client Support Delivery
Our Client Support Delivery operation is staffed globally and provides product support services to our clients 24 hours a day, seven days a week. A key element of our support delivery model is the assignment of one or more named Primary Support Engineers (“PSE”), who serve as the primary product support contact for our clients. PSEs provide technical advice, functional expertise and general support to ensure the resolution of all support issues. Our PSEs are focused exclusively on supporting our clients and have on average over 20 years of experience and significant real-world understanding of client

implementations and deployments. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we delivered an average support call response time of less than two minutes for an experienced engineer to engage with a client to address critical (P1) and serious (P2) issues, which is significantly shorter than the 10-minute guaranteed response time that is standard in our client support agreements.
Each PSE works as part of our global network of engineers and provides deep expertise for a vendor, product family and product line. Support engineers across the company are able to leverage their collective knowledge and experience to meet the complex support needs of our clients.
In 2020, we brought to market our artificial intelligence (“AI”) support applications. These AI applications were developed by Rimini Street’s Global Service Delivery Innovation Team, whose mission is to invent innovative solutions that further enhance a client’s overall service experience. Built using open-source technologies, the AI applications can be integrated into support processes along with other new AI applications when they become available.
In 2021, we were granted a U.S. patent for our “Case Assignment Advisor,” which is one of our AI applications used as a competitive advantage in servicing our clients. We believe our AI applications have already delivered substantial service benefits to clients, including accelerating case resolution times by an average of 23% and reducing case escalations by approximately 29%.
Product Delivery
The Product Delivery team manages the scoping, development, testing, and delivery of all client deliverables and internally developed applications, tools and technologies. The primary client deliverables are grouped into the following categories:
Global tax, legal and regulatory updates
We provide our clients with the proactive updates they need to maintain compliance with changing tax, payroll, accounting, fixed asset and related rates, regulations and standards. In addition, we also create and update documentation that supports our tax, legal and regulatory updates.
New client synchronization
When a client switches to our support, they may not be up to date with the latest tax, legal and regulatory updates made available by the enterprise software vendor. As part of the client onboarding process, our Product Delivery team assesses the compliance level of each client deployment and creates initial updates as needed for clients to enable full adherence to current tax, legal and regulatory standards in their jurisdictions of operation and to streamline the process for future updates.
We believe the quality and scope of our Product Delivery processes and deliverables surpass those of traditional enterprise software vendors. For example, we maintain updates for tax, legal, and regulatory changes for over 100 countries on a continuous basis by employing a rigorous software development lifecycle that complies with ISO 9001:2015 standards to ensure that required and identified tax, legal, and regulatory changes are delivered in an accurate and timely manner that based on management’s experience and analysis, we believe is typically earlier than traditional enterprise software vendors. Our Product Delivery organization is scalable and has the capability to deploy its solutions for additional countries based on the needs of our clients. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we have delivered more than 57,000 tax, legal and regulatory updates to clients with quality and accuracy.
Product Delivery professionals serve in a variety of roles which include business, functional and technical analysts as well as software development, testing, quality assurance and delivery professionals. Scoping professionals and business analysts utilize proprietary methodologies to search for updates across all supported jurisdictions and provide support for all product groups. Technical and software development professionals are product-focused and have relevant domain expertise. Testing and delivery professionals are responsible for the implementation of any changes and support all product groups. Engineers support all aspects of analysis, development and testing for the Product Delivery team. We believe this flexible model has enabled us to identify best practices and solutions for the multiple product lines we service. Additionally, we utilize internally developed proprietary tools, technologies and processes to efficiently research and deliver quality and timely tax, legal and regulatory updates.

Client Engagement
Client success managers in our Client Engagement organization serve as a single point of contact for all non-product support-related client issues. The Client Engagement organization works closely with our Support, Product Delivery and Sales organizations to provide what we believe, based on client feedback, support case satisfaction survey results and analyst checks, is an exceptional client experience with superior client satisfaction and success, with the ultimate goal of retention, renewal and expansion of our client contracts. The Client Engagement team oversees the following client management processes:
Onboarding
When a client switches to our support products and services, a client success manager oversees the onboarding process, which is a set of interwoven processes that new clients undertake to facilitate a successful migration to our support model. During this time, we help clients smoothly transition their support while we gain an in-depth understanding of a client’s business needs, IT infrastructure, IT strategies and objectives.
Account Management
Following the onboarding period, client success managers coordinate our resources and capabilities to provide personalized support to each client. When issues arise, client success managers escalate them within our organization as appropriate to help ensure client satisfaction. Client success managers are also tasked with establishing and maintaining executive relationships and promoting expansion of usage and cross-sell of our extensive services within each client’s organization.
Account Retention
Client success managers play an integral role in client retention by helping to ensure our clients are realizing the full value of our service offering and working with our Renewal Sales team on the renewal and extension of client contracts.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our solutions primarily through our global direct sales organization. We organize our sales force by geographic region with sales teams currently covering North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia and Asia-Pacific. We organize our sales and marketing professionals into territory-specific teams in order to align sales and marketing toward common sales goals. In some cases, we organize our sales professionals in a specific region or territory by the industry of our prospective or current clients and focus certain marketing activities by industry. A typical sales cycle with a prospective client begins with the generation of a sales lead through trade shows, industry events, online marketing, outbound calling or other means of referral. The sales cycle for our support services continues with an assessment of the prospective client’s support contract renewal date, sales presentations and, in many cases, client reference calls. Our sales cycle can vary substantially from client to client, but typically requires six to twelve months depending on the scope of the support, products or services being purchased. Enterprise software customers typically need to renew their vendor support contracts on an annual basis so there usually is already a budget for our Rimini Support solutions, and that budget is usually larger than our fees since most of our prospective clients are enterprise software vendor customers paying higher annual fees for their current support services than we charge for our Rimini Support solution. The sales cycle for our Rimini Manage or other solutions, beyond our Rimini Support solutions, may or may not be replacing the services of an incumbent vendor and therefore may not be dependent on the renewal date of an existing annual contract.
We attempt to commence discussions with prospective clients far enough in advance of that prospective client’s services end date with their current vendor, to provide enough time to complete the sale and to perform certain transition tasks. In certain situations, we will engage with a prospective client over multiple renewal cycles with their current vendor. In addition to new support, products and service sales to prospective and existing clients, we have a dedicated sales team focused on renewals of existing client subscription contracts.
We generate global prospect leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs. Our marketing programs target chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief procurement officers and other IT executives, senior business leaders and procurement specialists. We focus on the unique benefits of our offerings. Additionally, our marketing programs serve to create further market awareness of the benefits of each offering in our solutions portfolio. As a result of our efforts in educating organizations, we believe we are recognized as a thought leader in the enterprise application support market and a growing, serious competitor in our other newer solution markets such as managed services, security, interoperability, observability, and consulting.

•outreach and engagement with our active clients to explore cross-sell opportunities and maintain high retention rates.
Our Competitive Advantages
We believe that we have a number of competitive advantages that will enable us to strengthen our position as the leading independent provider of enterprise software support and our other new solution markets. Our key competitive strengths include:
Unique end-to-end software support, products and services model
Our enterprise software support, products and services model differentiates us from traditional enterprise software vendors. We built our company from the ground up to disrupt the traditional enterprise software vendor support model with what we believe is a better model and value for clients, and we have expanded our enterprise software products and services beyond support to include integrated managed services; security; interoperability; observability; and professional services. While this extended line of unified services expands our competitive field to include systems integrators, consultants, and some specialized software product providers, we believe that no other organization provides our unique set of unified support, products and services across multiple enterprise software product lines, anchored by our comprehensive enterprise software support solutions.
We continue to be focused on delivering unique, highly responsive and award-winning enterprise software support solutions, along with our additional services. We believe our innovative support products and services, offered at a value-driven price point, provide a significant return on investment for our clients that cannot be achieved by the use of traditional enterprise software vendor offerings. Our model includes unlimited support cases, requests, and tasks, and we offer industry-leading SLAs for response time and case update communications. 
Our team of over 1,000 support engineers, developers, and other experts span the globe, providing 24/7/365 “follow-the-sun” support to clients with operations in over 155 countries. On average, our highly qualified PSEs have over 20 years of relevant industry experience, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage and is a key element of our proven track record of providing exceptional client service.
Comprehensive support services
We offer clients a comprehensive suite of independent support offerings in terms of features and capabilities; global breadth; vendor products and releases supported; and tax, legal and regulatory updates. We believe our continued investment in our software support, products and services will expand our scope of services to the benefit of our clients.
Scalable business model
We have developed proprietary knowledge, software tools and processes in the design, development and delivery of our enterprise software support services. We have also designed an innovative support model that organizes our support engineers into modular, scalable teams. We believe our client support model enables us to scale quickly and cost-effectively to meet growing global demand in our existing product lines. We have become proficient at applying our support methodologies and approach to new product lines, enabling us to rapidly and efficiently support additional enterprise software products in the future. We have increased our ability to scale by investing in support-related infrastructure and by developing patented and patent-pending artificial intelligence support applications that further optimize our support processes and ensure service

delivery outcomes at scale for our clients. Additionally, we have received ISO certifications for our support services, which we believe helps ensure our clients consistently receive high quality, responsive service as our client base continues to grow.
Large global client base
As of December 31, 2022, we provided support, products and services for 3,020 active clients globally, including 75 Fortune 500 companies and 17 Fortune Global 100 companies. We also believe that our proven ability to deliver value to an extensive list of clients across a broad range of industries validates our business model and provides us with important references to prospective clients.
Clear leadership position
We are the global leader of independent enterprise software support services for Oracle and SAP products, based on both number of active clients and recognition by industry analyst firms. We believe we have substantial thought leadership in our market through our extensive marketing efforts and promotion of the independent enterprise software support model, including participation in key industry conferences, publishing white papers and hosting webinars. We believe that our leadership position enables us to bring new services to market more quickly, attract and retain high quality personnel, and acquire new clients.
Highly experienced management team
Our senior management team has over 150 years of combined experience in the enterprise software and services industry with companies such as Accenture, EDS, Hewlett-Packard, JD Edwards, Oracle, PeopleSoft, ServiceSource, SAP, and Wind River and with a significant amount of time and experience focused on building, managing and delivering support products and services. We believe our senior management team’s significant relevant industry experience positions us to continue to extend our market leadership.
Client-centric culture
We believe that our culture is a key element of our success and one of our core values. We recruit employees who share a passion for delivering exceptional service to our clients and continuously measure, recognize and reward employees for achieving exemplary client satisfaction. We further believe that our culture has enabled us to attract and retain high-quality, experienced and skilled professionals. Over the years, we have earned several Great Place To Work® awards globally, have achieved exceptional client satisfaction ratings and have won numerous Stevie Awards for customer service.
Our Growth Strategy
We possess deep expertise in enterprise software products, services and support and intend to leverage our leadership position to further penetrate our current markets and expand our support product and service capabilities into new markets. The key elements of our growth strategy include:
Add new clients
We believe that the market for independent enterprise software support products and services is large, growing and underserved. We expect significant growth opportunities in our market as organizations increasingly look to achieve more value from their technology budgets. We are continuing to make significant investments in sales and marketing and will continue our strong focus on acquiring new clients.
Continue global expansion
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated approximately 47% of our revenue outside of the United States. We believe that there is a large opportunity to grow our global business by increasing our direct sales force and by selective use of strategic marketing and sales partnerships around the world. We attribute revenue to individual countries based on the location of the contracting entity. No foreign country individually comprised more than 10% of revenue for the three-year period ended December 31, 2022.

 Expand the portfolio of supported vendors and products
Since our inception over 17 years ago, we have developed a comprehensive portfolio of enterprise software support and related products and services, including support services for applications, databases and technologies; management services for applications, databases, technologies, cloud and security; security, interoperability and observability solutions; and professional services. We offer more than 20 Rimini Street solutions across six suites of products and services: Rimini Support, Rimini Manage, Rimini Protect, Rimini Connect, Rimini Watch and Rimini Consult. These products and services cover over 40,000 SKUs of software and technologies from primarily five software vendors, Oracle, SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft and IBM, as well as for open-source software. We believe there is a significant market opportunity to offer support and related products and services for additional vendors and software, and we intend to extend our Rimini Support offerings to additional enterprise software vendors, product lines and releases.
Capitalize on the shift to hybrid IT
We believe organizations are increasingly creating more complex IT environments that are a mixture of multiple technologies, business models and vendors, including perpetual license and subscription license software solutions, deployed across the client’s system and cloud computing providers (hybrid IT environments), and consisting of proprietary and non-proprietary open-source software, all from a multitude of different technology vendors. We believe traditional enterprise software vendors and general consulting firms cannot effectively support these heterogeneous environments because of complex integrations, customizations, multi-vendor relationships and other unique challenges. Further, we believe a hybrid IT strategy enables organizations to reliably and cost-effectively run their business on an existing, stable core enterprise software platform, while at the same time enabling them to more quickly adopt new innovative applications and services, including digital, cloud, mobile and analytics. Multi-application, multi-environment solutions create a unique growth opportunity for independent support providers like Rimini Street.
Further penetrate our existing client base
We intend to increase adoption of our solutions among our existing clients by selling additional Rimini Support contracts for other software products, releases and instances used within their organizations as well as by selling new contracts for our expanded portfolio of solutions, including, but not limited to, managed services, security, interoperability, observability and professional services. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 64% of our over 1,510 unique clients have selected us to provide services, products and solutions for more than one of their software product lines, and we believe there is additional opportunity for growth within our existing client base. Our client-centric focus in combination with the critical nature of our portfolio of solutions, enables us to maintain close working relationships with our clients’ primary decision makers, which we believe helps us identify and capitalize on additional growth opportunities. 
 Expand Managed Services global offering 
Our Rimini Manage for SAP and Oracle enterprise software was launched during the second half of 2019 and integrates our ultra-responsive traditional support services with clients’ day-to-day AMS needs. AMS is comprised of system administration, operational support, health monitoring and enhancement support, and we believe this offering can provide clients with a better model, better people, and better outcomes with higher satisfaction and potentially significant savings of time, labor and money. We also believe that Rimini Manage can deliver these same benefits to clients who require database management services for a wide array of databases. In addition, we are a Salesforce partner and offer Rimini Manage for their Salesforce Sales Cloud, Salesforce Service Cloud, and other Salesforce products. We are also an Amazon Web Services (AWS) partner and offer Rimini Manage for their cloud offering used by our clients.
Launch new enterprise software support solutions
We intend to develop and bring to market new enterprise software solutions that help our clients with various business needs. For example, we recently announced multiple suites of services that bring together existing and new support, products and service solutions.
Clients
As of December 31, 2022, we supported 3,020 active clients globally, including 75 Fortune 500 companies and 17 Fortune Global 100 companies across a broad range of industries. We define an active client as a distinct entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a business unit of a company that purchases our support, products or services. For example, we count as two separate active client instances in circumstances where we provide support for two

different products to the same entity. We define a unique client as a distinct entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution or subsidiary, division or business unit of a company that purchases one or more of our products or services. For example, we count as two separate unique clients when two separate subsidiaries, divisions or business units of an entity purchase our products or services.
Human Capital Resources
We have built our culture centered on our dedication to provide our clients with an exceptional service experience. Our employees focus on providing exceptional service to our clients, and we strive to foster an environment that enables and encourages them in this pursuit. To this end, we view all employees as partners and are committed to providing an exciting, participatory and team-oriented work environment. This commitment starts with our Core Values, known as our “4 C’s”:
As a key aspect of our success, we believe our culture enables us to recruit and retain high quality talent. In addition, we strive to offer compensation, bonus and benefit programs appropriate for proven top-performing professionals. To ensure alignment with our short- and long-term objectives, our compensation programs for all employees include base pay, short-term incentives, and opportunities for long-term incentives. Furthermore, we believe our remote delivery model provides an attractive employment option for our highly experienced PSEs compared to consulting roles that can require significant travel, and also reduces our carbon footprint. Further, we offer programs and resources designed to support the mental, physical, social and financial well-being of our employees. In addition to resources available through our health care plan providers, we provide voluntary web-based training on health and wellness topics (such as first aid/CPR, fire safety, and how to prepare for inclement weather conditions), as well as professional development seminars on topics such as time management and leadership skills. 
We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment and are proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer. Qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to age, race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender or gender identity, disability, protected veterans’ status or any other characteristic protected by law.
We have achieved Great Place to Work® (a recognized global authority on workplace culture and employee satisfaction) certifications in the United States, the United Kingdom, India, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France and Israel. The certification is achieved by distributing a third-party, anonymous survey to all employees in a geographic area and renewed each year to maintain certification.

From 2020 through 2022, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided special compensation bonuses for lower-paid employees and special compensation bonuses for the few of our employees who tested positive for COVID-19. 
Finally, through the Rimini Street Foundation, which is an initiative funded by the Company, we encourage our employees to “support humankind” and share our Company’s success by investing back into the communities we serve through in-kind donations, employee time and Company financial support.

As of December 31, 2022, we employed over 1,920 professionals globally. We also engage temporary employees and consultants as needed. None of our U.S.-based employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Certain of our non-U.S.-based employees are members of unions, works councils, trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in particular jurisdictions, as required by local labor laws. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good.
Technology Infrastructure and Operations
We have IT infrastructure and staff globally. Our operations support our client offerings, compliance requirements and future global expansion. To connect to systems owned, leased or otherwise controlled by our clients, we utilize site-to-site tunnels, virtual private networks with secure firewall administration and other secure connection methodologies underpinned with a high level of global network reliability, security and performance.
We maintain a formal and comprehensive information security management system, which is certified to ISO 27001: 2013. It is designed to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of client data, protect against security threats or data breaches, and prevent unauthorized access to the data of our clients. We control access to our office space where confidential and security-controlled information is located or may be visible while in use, have deployed advanced security software and hardware, and utilize advanced security measures. In addition, we have responsibility to comply with certain client-specific security contractual requirements and government security laws and regulations for some of our clients. 
Compliance and Certifications
ISO certifications are part of our commitment to developing and executing best-in-class processes to ensure our clients consistently receive exceptional service. We have achieved and maintain ISO 9001 and ISO 27001 certifications.
In 2010, we achieved ISO 9001 Quality Management System certification for “Third-party provider of enterprise software support services specifically on-boarding of client and client environments”. In 2011, we expanded our certification for “Provision of third-party enterprise software support services specifically on-boarding of client, building of client environments, worldwide tax and regulatory research and delivery of tax and regulatory updates”. In 2012, we expanded our certification for “Global provision of enterprise software support services, including client onboarding; client account management; product support for vendor delivered and client customized code; fix development and delivery; and research, development and delivery of worldwide tax, legal and regulatory updates”. The certification process verifies that detailed processes for relevant business areas are reviewed, continuously monitored and improved to ensure services and deliverables are consistently delivered with excellence. During 2018, the ISO standard was upgraded. Our current ISO 9001:2015 certification is effective December 2022 through December 2025. During this certification cycle, annual surveillance audits are conducted to validate ongoing compliance to the requirements.

In 2013, we achieved worldwide ISO 27001 information security certification for our support services. ISO 27001 is a security standard covering “The information security management system that supports the global provisioning of third-party software maintenance services”. Independent assessments of our conformity to the ISO 27001 standard includes evaluating security risks, designing and implementing comprehensive security controls and adopting an information security management process to meet security needs on an ongoing basis. Our current ISO 27001:2013 certification is effective April 2022 through March 2025. During this certification cycle, annual surveillance audits are conducted to validate ongoing compliance to the requirements. 
Competition
We compete in the global IT services market for enterprise software support, products and services and believe the principal competitive factors in our market include, but are not limited to, the following:
•track record of technical capability to provide the required software support;
•ability to identify, develop and deliver required tax, legal and regulatory updates;
-13-


•infrastructure model to deliver support globally within guaranteed service levels;
•track record of providing a high level of client satisfaction;
•ease of support model onboarding, deployment and usage;
•breadth and depth of support functionality, including the ability to support customized software;
•cost of products and services;
•brand awareness and reputation;
•capability for delivering services in a secure, scalable and reliable manner;
•ability to innovate and respond to client needs rapidly; and
•size of referenceable client base.
As further discussed under “Our Competitive Advantages,” above, we believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. We have also invested significant resources in developing our unique service methodologies. We believe our support management model allows us to gain an in-depth understanding of a given client’s unique software environment, enabling rapid and accurate responses to a client’s service requests.
We believe our primary competitors for our Rimini Support solutions are the enterprise software vendors whose products we service and support, including, but not limited to, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. We expect that continued growth in our market could lead to significantly increased competition resulting from new entrants. In the meantime, our success and growth will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of companies to engage an independent service vendor such as us to provide software maintenance and support services for their enterprise software.
We believe our primary competitors for our Rimini Manage, Rimini Consult and Rimini Watch solutions are systems integrators and consulting firms globally, including, but not limited to, Accenture, IBM, Wipro, Cap Gemini and DXC. We expect the market for these solutions to continue to be highly competitive. Our success and growth in management services will rely in part on our ability to differentiate the value and benefits of our fully integrated support and management solutions compared to other vendors’ offerings or internal resources, and our success and growth in consulting will rely in part on our ability to differentiate our talent, experience, value and benefits compared to other vendors’ resources and offerings.
We believe our primary competitors for our Rimini Protect solutions are manufacturers of other enterprise software security solutions, including, but not limited to, Oracle, SAP and IBM. We believe our primary competitors for our Rimini Connect solutions are manufacturers of other enterprise interoperability and connectivity products, including, but not limited to Citrix, Dell, Salesforce, Oracle and IBM. We expect the market for these solutions to continue to be highly competitive. Our success and growth in security and interoperability solutions will rely in part on our ability to differentiate the value and benefits of our solutions compared to other vendors’ offerings.
However, we also believe some of our actual and potential competitors currently have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, greater name recognition and deeper customer relationships. Additionally, some software licensees are reluctant to engage a smaller independent company such as us to provide services for their enterprise application software, choosing instead to rely on services provided by their enterprise software vendor or other larger competitors in our various service markets.
Intellectual Property

We rely on federal, state, common law and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property consisting of a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names and patented technology. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties, such as service providers, vendors, individuals and entities that may be exploring a business relationship with us.

We currently have four patent applications pending in the United States. We own U.S. Patent No. 10,509,639 which will expire in August 2035, U.S. Patent No. 10,749,926 which will expire in September 2034, and U.S. Patent No. 11,182,707 which will expire in July 2039, as long as the patent maintenance fees are paid during the corresponding fee payment windows.

Such registered trademarks will expire unless renewed at various times in the future.
Policing unauthorized use of our processes and software tools and intellectual property rights is difficult. As of the date of this Report, we are not aware of any material breaches of our intellectual property rights.
