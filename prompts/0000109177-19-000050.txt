General Overview
﻿
We are a diversified global branded consumer products company.  We manage the business in four vertically integrated, product focused segments: (i) Hardware & Home Improvement (“HHI”), (ii) Home and Personal Care (“HPC”), (iii) Global Pet Care (“GPC”), and (iv) Home and Garden (“H&G”).  The Company manufactures, markets and/or distributes its products globally in the North America (“NA”); Europe, Middle East & Africa (“EMEA”); Latin America (“LATAM”) and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) regions through a variety of trade channels, including retailers, wholesalers and distributors, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and construction companies. We enjoy strong name recognition in our regions under our various brands and patented technologies across multiple product categories. Geographic strategic initiatives and financial objectives are determined at the corporate level. Each segment is responsible for implementing defined strategic initiatives and achieving certain financial objectives and has a president or general manager responsible for sales and marketing initiatives and the financial results for all product lines within that segment. SB/RH is a wholly owned subsidiary of SBH. Spectrum Brands, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SB/RH (“SBI”) incurred certain debt guaranteed by SB/RH and domestic subsidiaries of SBI. The following is an overview of the consolidated business showing the net sales by segment and geographic region sold (based upon destination) as a percentage of consolidated net sales for the year ended September 30, 2019.



Our operating performance is influenced by a number of factors including: general economic conditions; foreign exchange fluctuations; trends in consumer markets; consumer confidence and preferences; our overall product line mix, including pricing and gross margin, which vary by product line and geographic market; pricing of certain raw materials and commodities; energy and fuel prices; and our general competitive position, especially as impacted by our competitors’ advertising and promotional activities and pricing strategies. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in Item 7 to this Annual Report, for further discussion of the consolidated operating results and segment operating results.

The principal raw materials used in manufacturing include brass, zinc, and steel that are sourced either on a global or regional basis. The prices of these raw materials are susceptible to fluctuations due to supply and demand trends, energy costs, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, general economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances. We have regularly engaged in forward purchase and hedging derivative transactions in an attempt to effectively manage certain raw material costs we expect to incur over the next 12 to 24 months. Substantially all of our Pfister products are manufactured by third party suppliers that are primarily located in the APAC region. We maintain ownership of most of the tooling used by our suppliers. We continually evaluate our manufacturing facilities’ capacity and related utilization. In general, we believe our existing facilities are adequate for our present and foreseeable needs. 
﻿
Our research and development strategy is focused on new product development and performance enhancements of our existing products. We plan to continue to use our brand names, customer relationships and research and development efforts to introduce innovative products that offer enhanced value to consumers through new designs and improved functionality.

Upon request, BDC may elect to extend the license to use the Black & Decker® brand to certain additional product categories. BDC has approved several extensions of the license to additional categories and geographies.﻿
