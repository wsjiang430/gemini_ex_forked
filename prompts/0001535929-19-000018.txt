Item 1. Business
For the purposes of this discussion, the term Voya Financial, Inc. refers to Voya Financial, Inc. and the terms "Company," "we," "our," and "us" refer to Voya Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
We are a leading retirement, investment and employee benefits company providing complementary solutions to improve the financial outcomes of approximately 13.8 million individual customers, workplace participants and institutions in the United States as of December 31, 2018. Our vision is to be America’s Retirement Company™. Our approximately 6,000 employees (as of December 31, 2018) are focused on executing our mission to make a secure financial future possible—one person, one family and one institution at a time. Through our complementary set of businesses, we help our customers save, grow, protect and enjoy their wealth to and through retirement. We offer our products and services through a broad group of financial intermediaries, independent producers, affiliated advisors and dedicated sales specialists throughout the United States.
Our extensive scale and breadth of product offerings are designed to help Americans achieve their retirement savings, investment income and protection goals. Our strategy is centered on preparing customers for financial wellness—being emotionally and economically secure and ready for their retirement. We believe that the aging of the U.S. population, weakening of traditional social safety nets, shifting of responsibility for retirement planning from institutions to individuals and growth in total retirement account assets will drive significant demand for our products and services going forward. We believe that we are well positioned to deliver on this Retirement Readiness need.
We believe that we help our customers achieve three essential financial goals, as they plan for, invest for and protect their retirement years: 
We provide our products and services principally through four segments: Retirement, Investment Management, Employee Benefits and Individual Life. In October 2018, we concluded a strategic review of our Individual Life business and announced that we would cease new individual life insurance sales and while retaining our in-force block of individual life policies. Applications for individual life insurance policies were accepted through the end of 2018, resulting in some placement of policies in the first quarter of 2019. Our pivot away from the individual life insurance market aligns with our strategic focus on higher-growth, higher-return, capital-light businesses, centered on workplace and institutional clients. 
Activities not related to our business segments such as our corporate operations, corporate-level assets and financial obligations are included in Corporate. 
The following table presents a summary of our key individual and institutional markets, how we define those markets, and the key products we sell in such markets: 
Our Segments
Voya is committed to being America's Retirement Company, and is focused on high-growth, high-return, capital light businesses that provide complementary solutions to workplaces and institutions. 
As of December 31, 2018, on a consolidated basis, we had $467.3 billion in total AUM and AUA and total shareholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income/loss ("AOCI") and noncontrolling interests, of $7.6 billion. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated $610 million of Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, and $802 million of Adjusted operating earnings before income taxes. Adjusted operating earnings before income taxes is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of Adjusted operating earnings before income taxes to Income (loss) before income taxes, see "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations— Company Consolidated."
ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY AND STRUCTURE
Our History
Prior to our initial public offering in May 2013, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of ING Groep N.V. ("ING Group"), a global financial institution based in the Netherlands.
Through ING Group, we entered the United States life insurance market in 1975 with the acquisition of Wisconsin National Life Insurance Company, followed in 1976 with ING Group's acquisition of Midwestern United Life Insurance Company and Security Life of Denver Insurance Company in 1977. ING Group significantly expanded its presence in the United States in the late 1990s and 2000s with the acquisitions of Equitable Life Insurance Company of Iowa (1997), Furman Selz, an investment advisory company (1997), ReliaStar Life Insurance Company (including Pilgrim Capital Corporation) (2000), Aetna Life Insurance and Annuity Company (including Aeltus Investment Management) (2000) and CitiStreet (2008). ING Group completely divested its ownership of Voya Financial, Inc. common stock between 2013 and 2015, and, as of March 2018, ING Group has also divested its remaining interest in warrants to acquire additional shares of our common stock, which it acquired in connection with our IPO.
Our Organizational Structure
We are a holding company incorporated in Delaware in April 1999. We operate our businesses through a number of direct and indirect subsidiaries. The following organizational chart presents the ownership and jurisdiction of incorporation of our principal subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018:
The chart above includes:

• | Voya Financial, Inc.


• | Our principal intermediate holding company, Voya Holdings, which is the direct parent of a number of our insurance and non-insurance operating entities.


• | Our principal operating entities that are the primary sources of cash distributions to Voya Financial, Inc. Specifically, these entities are our principal insurance operating companies (VRIAC, SLD and RLI) and Voya Investment Management LLC, the holding company for entities that operate our Investment Management segment.


• | SLDI, our Arizona captive.

CBVA and Annuity Transaction
On June 1, 2018, we consummated a series of transactions (collectively, the "Transaction") pursuant to a Master Transaction Agreement dated December 20, 2017 (the "MTA") with VA Capital Company LLC, a newly formed Delaware limited liability company ("VA Capital"), and Athene Holding Ltd., a Bermuda limited company ("Athene"), pursuant to which VA Capital's wholly owned subsidiary Venerable Holdings Inc. ("Venerable") acquired certain of our assets, including all of the shares of the capital stock of Voya Insurance and Annuity Company ("VIAC"), our Iowa-domiciled insurance subsidiary, and all of the membership interests of Directed Services LLC, an indirect broker-dealer subsidiary ("DSL"). This transaction resulted in our disposition of substantially all of our variable annuity and fixed and fixed indexed annuity businesses and related assets.
VA Capital is a holding company formed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management LLC ("Apollo") and Athene (collectively, the "Sponsors"). In connection with the Transaction, we also acquired a 9.99% equity interest in VA Capital. In addition, our other insurance subsidiaries continue to own surplus notes issued by VIAC in aggregate principal amount of $350 million.
Following its acquisition of VIAC, Venerable holds substantially all of the variable annuity business that was previously reported as our Closed Block Variable Annuity ("CBVA") segment, with an aggregate account value of approximately $35 billion based on June 30, 2017 balances. We separated CBVA from our other operations in 2009 and 2010, placing them in run-off as part of a strategic decision to stop actively writing new retail variable annuity products with substantial guarantee features. Accordingly, this segment was classified as a closed block and was managed separately from our other segments. 
Concurrently with the sale of VIAC, VIAC reinsured to Athene its individual fixed and fixed indexed annuities policies, and we also reinsured to Athene the fixed annuities policies of RLI, our Minnesota-domiciled insurance subsidiary. With approximately $19 billion of account value as of June 30, 2017, the VIAC and RLI policies reinsured to Athene represented a significant majority of our fixed and fixed indexed annuities business. We ceased manufacturing non-retirement-focused annuities after the Transaction closed. Following the Transaction, VIAC or one of Venerable's other affiliates became responsible for administering most of the variable, fixed and fixed indexed annuities included in the Transaction, subject to some exceptions and arrangements under which we provide some transitional services to Venerable for a limited time. Certain businesses in our former Annuities segment were not part of the Transaction, including approximately $6 billion in investment-only products (primarily Select Advantage) written by our other insurance affiliates that were retained by us. 
As part of the Transaction, Voya IM or its affiliated advisors entered into agreements to perform asset management services for Venerable and to serve as the preferred asset management partner for Venerable. Under these agreements, subject to certain criteria, Voya IM or its affiliated advisors manage specified assets of Venerable for a minimum of five years following the closing of the Transaction.
OUR BUSINESSES 
Retirement
Our Retirement segment is focused on meeting the needs of individuals in preparing for and sustaining a secure retirement through employer-sponsored plans and services, as well as through individual account rollover plans and comprehensive financial product offerings and planning and advisory services. We are well positioned in the marketplace, with our industry-leading Institutional Retirement Plans business and our Retail Wealth Management business having a combined $316.5 billion of AUM and AUA as of December 31, 2018, of which $67.0 billion were in proprietary assets.
Our Institutional Retirement Plans business offers tax-deferred employer-sponsored retirement savings plan and administrative services to corporations of all sizes, public and private school systems, higher education institutions, hospitals and healthcare facilities, not-for-profit organizations and state and local governments. We also offer stable value products to institutional plan sponsors. This broad-based institutional business is diversified across many sectors of the economy. In the defined contribution market, we provide services to more than 49,000 plan sponsors covering approximately 5.1 million plan participant accounts as of December 31, 2018.
Our Retail Wealth Management business, with AUM and AUA of $9.1 billion as of December 31, 2018, focuses on the rapidly expanding retiree market as well as on pre-retirees within our defined contribution plans. This business offers retail financial products and comprehensive financial planning and advisory services to help individuals manage their retirement savings and income needs. 
Our Retirement segment earns revenue principally from asset and participant-based advisory and recordkeeping fees. Retirement generated Adjusted operating earnings before income taxes of $701 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our Investment Management segment also earns market-based fees from the management of the general account and mutual fund assets supporting Institutional Retirement Plans and certain Retail Wealth Management rollover products and advisory solutions. Distribution of Investment Management products and services using the Retirement segment continues to present a growth opportunity for our Retirement and Investment Management segments.
We will continue to focus on growing our retirement platform through focused sales and retention efforts in our Institutional Retirement Plans business and by leveraging our financial wellness offerings and Retail Wealth Management business to deepen relationships with our Institutional Retirement Plan participants. We will also continue to place a strong emphasis on capital and cost management while also growing our distribution platform, achieving a diversified retirement product mix and focusing on innovation efforts that make it easy to do business with us and drive positive outcomes for customers. 
An important element of our Retirement strategy is to leverage the extensive customer base to which we have access through our Institutional Retirement Plans business in order to grow our Retail Wealth Management and Investment Management businesses. We are therefore focused on building long-term relationships with our plan participants, especially when initiated through service touch points such as plan enrollments and rollovers, which will enable us to offer such participant's individual retirement and investment management solutions both during and after the term of their plan participation.
Institutional Retirement Plans
Products and Services
We are one of only a few providers that offer tax-deferred institutional retirement savings plans, services and support to the full spectrum of businesses, ranging from small to mega-sized plans and across all markets and code sections. These plans may either be offered as full service options or recordkeeping services products. We also offer stable value investment options to institutional clients.
Full-service retirement products provide recordkeeping and plan administration services, tailored participant communications and education programs, award-winning myOrangeMoney® digital capabilities for sponsors and plan participants (plus mobile capabilities for participants), trustee services and institutional and retail investments. Offerings include a wide variety of investment and administrative products for defined contribution plans for tax-advantaged retirement savings, as well as nonqualified executive benefit plans and employer stock option plans. Plan sponsors may select from a variety of investment structures and products, such as general account, separate account, mutual funds, stable value or collective investment trusts and a variety of underlying asset types (including their own employer stock) to best meet the needs of their employees. A broad selection of funds is available for our products in all asset categories from over 180 fund families, including the Voya family of mutual funds managed by our Investment Management segment. Our full-service retirement plan offerings are also supported by financial planning and investment advisory services offered through our Retail Wealth Management business or through third parties (e.g., Morningstar) to help prepare individuals for retirement through customer-focused personalized and objective investment advice.
Recordkeeping service products provide recordkeeping and plan administration support for a sponsor base that includes multi-employer corporate plans, large-mega corporations and state and local governments. Our recordkeeping retirement plan offerings are also supported by participant communications and education programs, award-winning myOrangeMoney® digital capabilities for sponsors and plan participants (plus mobile capabilities for participants), as well as financial planning and investment advisory services offered through our Retail Wealth Management business and Voya Retirement Advisors (our registered investment advisor group serving in-plan participants with the in-plan advisory services program).
Stable value investment options may be offered within our full service institutional plans, or as investment-only options within our recordkeeping services plans or within other vendor plans. Our product offering includes both separate account guaranteed investment contracts ("GICs") and synthetic GICs managed by either proprietary or outside investment managers.
Pension risk transfer group annuity solutions were previously offered to institutional plan sponsors who needed to transfer their defined benefit plan obligations to us. We discontinued sales of these solutions in late 2016 to better align our business activities to our strategic priorities, but continue to manage existing policies and assets.

In 2017, we launched an enhanced version of our Voya Framework product that can be sold across both full service corporate and tax-exempt markets. It is a mutual fund program offered to fund qualified retirement plans, and it gives plan advisors and third party administrators who work with us a uniform and consistent product experience across multiple plan markets. The product is distinguished by its flexible recordkeeping platform and contains over 300 funds from well-known fund families for smaller plans or can be provided as an open architecture investment platform for larger plans (which offers most funds for which trades are cleared through the National Securities Clearing Corporation). This product also includes our general account and various stable value investment options.
In addition to Voya Framework, we offer products customized to each of the full service corporate market and the full service tax exempt market.
For plans in the full service corporate market, we offer Voya MAP Select, a group funding agreement/group annuity contract to fund qualified retirement plans. Voya MAP Select contains over 300 funds from well-known fund families for smaller plans or can be provided as an open architecture investment platform for larger plans (which offers most funds for which trades are cleared through the National Securities Clearing Corporation). This product also includes our general account and various stable value investment options.
For plans in the full service tax-exempt market, we offer a variety of products that include the following:

• | Voya Retirement Choice II and RetireFlex-MF, mutual fund products which provide flexible funding vehicles and are designed to provide a diversified menu of mutual funds in addition to a guaranteed option (available through a group fixed annuity contract or stable value product).

Markets and Distribution
Our Institutional Retirement Plans business can be categorized into two primary markets: Corporate and Tax Exempt. Both markets utilize our award-winning myOrangeMoney® participant-facing digital capabilities as a centerpiece to help shift the mindset of plan participants from focusing only on accumulation to focusing on both accumulation and adequate income in retirement. Additionally, a broad suite of financial wellness offerings, including retirement and financial planning, guidance and advisory products, tools and services are offered to help our plan participants in all markets reach their retirement goals. A brief description of each market, including sub segments and areas of particular focus, are as follows:
Corporate Markets:

• | Small-Mid Corporate Market. In this market, we offer full service solutions to defined contribution plans of small-mid-sized corporations (i.e., typically less than 1,000 employees). Our product offerings include an open architecture investment platform, comprehensive fiduciary solutions, dedicated and proactive service teams and product and service innovations leveraged from our expertise across multiple market segments (all sizes of plans as well as code sections). Furthermore, we offer a unique enrollment experience through our myOrangeMoney® digital capabilities that helps engage and inform plan participants with retirement savings and income goals.


• | Large-Mega Corporate Market. In this market we offer recordkeeping services to defined contribution plans of large to mega-sized corporations (i.e., typically more than 1,000 employees). Our solutions and capabilities support the most complex retirement plans with a special focus on client relationship management, tailored communication campaigns and education and enrollment support to help employers prepare their employees for retirement. We are dedicated to providing engaging information through innovative award-winning technology-based tools and print materials to help plan participants achieve a secure and dignified retirement.

Tax Exempt Markets:

• | Education Market. We offer comprehensive full service solutions to both public and private K-12 educational entities as well as public and private higher education institutions. In the United States, we rank fourth in both the K-12 and higher education markets by assets as of September 30, 2018. Our support to plan sponsors, including solutions to reduce administrative burden, deep technical and regulatory expertise, and strong on-site service teams, plus advisor support and a broad suite of financial wellness products, tools, and services for participants, continue to strengthen our position as one of the top providers in this market.


• | Healthcare/Other Non Profits Market. In this market we service hospitals, healthcare organizations and not-for-profit entities by offering full service solutions for a variety of plan types. We offer services that reduce sponsors' administrative burdens and provide them with deep technical and fiduciary expertise. Additionally, we offer on-site service teams to assist plan sponsors with their plans and to assist their employees with understanding and taking advantage of their plan benefits. We also provide tailored communications, education and enrollment support plus a broad suite of financial wellness products, tools and services in order to better prepare plan participants for retirement.


• | Government Market. We provide both full service and recordkeeping services offerings to small and large governmental entities (e.g., state and local government) with a client base that spans all 50 states plus US territories. For large governmental sponsors, we offer recordkeeping services that meet the most complex of needs, while also offering extensive participant communication and retirement education support, including a broad suite of financial wellness products, tools and services. We also offer a broad range of proprietary, non-proprietary and stable value investment options. Our flexibility

and expertise help make us the third ranked provider in the government market in the United States based on AUM and AUA as of September 30, 2018.
Products for Institutional Retirement Plans are distributed nationally through multiple unaffiliated channels supported by our employee wholesale field force and dedicated sales teams and via other affiliated distribution through our owned broker-dealer, Voya Financial Advisors ("VFA"). We offer localized support to distribution partners and their clients during and after the sales process as well as a broad selection of investment options with flexibility of choice and comprehensive fiduciary solutions to help their clients meet or exceed plan guidelines and responsibilities.
Unaffiliated Distribution:

• | Independent Sales Agents. As of December 31, 2018, we work with more than 4,000 sales agents who primarily sell fixed annuity products from multiple vendors in the education market. Activities by these representatives are centered on increasing participant enrollments and deferral amounts in our existing K-12 education segment plans.


• | Brokers and Advisors. Nearly 12,000 wirehouse and independent regional and local brokers, specialty retirement plan advisors plus registered investment advisors (as of December 31, 2018) are the primary distributors of our small-mid corporate market products, and they also distribute products to the education, healthcare and government markets. These producers typically present their clients (i.e., employers seeking a defined contribution plan for their employees) with plan options from multiple vendors for comparison and may also help with employee enrollment and education.


• | Third Party Administrators ("TPAs"). As of December 31, 2018, we have long-standing relationships with over 1,200 TPAs who work with a variety of retirement plan providers and are selling and/or service partners for our small-mid corporate markets and select tax exempt market plans. While TPAs typically focus on providing plan services only (such as administration and compliance testing), some also initiate and complete the sales process. TPAs also play a vital role as the connecting point between our wholesale team and unaffiliated producers who seek references for determining which providers they should recommend to their clients.

Affiliated Distribution:

• | Voya Financial Advisors ("VFA"). Our owned broker-dealer is one of the top quartile broker-dealers in the United States as determined by the total number of licensed and producing representatives and by gross revenue. As of December 31, 2018, VFA provided licensing and operational support to approximately 1,700 field and phone-based representatives. The field based financial planning and advisory representatives support sales of products, financial planning and advisory services for the Retirement segment. A closely affiliated sub-set of the field-based channel focuses primarily on driving enrollment and contribution activity within our education, healthcare and government market institutional plans. They also provide in-plan education and guidance plus retail sold-financial advisory services to help individuals in these markets meet their retirement savings and income goals. The home office phone-based representatives focus on providing education, guidance and rollover support services to our institutional plan participants.


• | Wholesale Field Force. Locally based employee wholesalers focus on expanding and strengthening relationships with unaffiliated distribution partners and third party administrators who sell and service our institutional plan offerings to employers across the nation.


• | Dedicated Voya Sales Teams. Our employee sales teams work with more than 90 different pension/specialty consulting firms that represent employers in corporate and tax-exempt markets seeking large-mega institutional plans and/or stable value solutions. Additionally, we have salaried phone-based sales teams that focus on supporting our institutional plan participants across all markets.

Competition
Our Institutional Retirement Plans business competes with other large, well-established insurance companies, asset managers, record keepers and diversified financial institutions. Competition varies in all market segments as few institutions are able to compete across all markets as we do. The following chart presents a summary of the current competitive landscape in the markets where we offer our Institutional Retirement Plans and stable value solutions:

Market/Product Segment | Competitive Landscape | Select Competitors
Small-Mid Corporate | Primary competitors are mutual fund companies and insurance-based providers with third-party administration relationships | EmpowerFidelity 
K-12 Education | Primary competitors are insurance-based providers that focus on school districts across the nation | AXAVALIC 
Higher Education | Competitors are 403(b) plan providers, asset managers and some insurance-based providers | TIAAFidelity 
Healthcare & Other Non-Profits | Competition varies across 403(b) plan providers, asset managers and some insurance-based providers | FidelityTIAA 
Government | Competitors are primarily insurance-based providers, but also include asset managers and 457 providers | EmpowerNationwide 
Recordkeeping | Competitors are primarily asset managers and business consulting services firms, but also include payroll firms and insurance-based providers | FidelityEmpower 
Stable Value | Competitors are primarily select insurance companies who are also dedicated to the Stable value market, but also include certain banking institutions | PrudentialMetLife 

In addition, we also compete more generally in the Institutional Retirement Plans business against companies such as Principal Financial, MassMutual, John Hancock, Lincoln Financial and Transamerica. 
Our Institutional Retirement Plans business competes primarily based on pricing for value delivered with a strong focus on an excellent customer experience. Our full-service business also competes on the breadth of our service and investment offerings, technical/regulatory expertise, industry experience, local enrollment and education support, investment flexibility and our ability to offer industry tailored product features to meet the financial wellness and retirement income needs of our clients. We have seen industry concentration in the large plan recordkeeping business, as providers seek to increase scale, improve cost efficiencies and enter new market segments. We emphasize our strong sponsor relationships, flexible value-added services, ability to customize recordkeeping and administration services to match client needs, and technical and regulatory expertise as our competitive strengths. Additionally, we compete with our broad suite of products and financial wellness tools and services, including our award-winning myOrangeMoney® retirement income focused digital and mobile capabilities, to help employers support the retirement preparedness and financial needs of their employees. Our long standing experience in the retirement market underscored by strong stable value expertise allows us to effectively compete against existing and new providers.
Underwriting and Pricing
We price our institutional retirement products based on long-term assumptions that include investment returns, mortality, persistency and operating costs. We establish target returns for each product based upon these factors and the expected amount of regulatory and rating agency capital that we must hold to support these contracts over their projected lifetime. We monitor and manage pricing and sales mix to achieve target returns. It may take new business several years before it is profitable, depending on the nature and life of the product, and returns are subject to variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions. We seek to mitigate 
investment risk by actively managing market and credit risks associated with investments and through asset/liability matching portfolio management.
Retail Wealth Management
Products and Services
Our Retail Wealth Management business offers a variety of investments and protection products, along with holistic advice and guidance delivered through field-based financial planning and advisory representatives and home office phone-based representatives. Our current investment solutions include a variety of mutual fund custodial IRA products, managed accounts and advisory programs, and brokerage accounts.
We also continue to offer certain tax-qualified mutual fund custodial products that were retained from the Annuities business we divested in the Transaction. 
While the primary focus of our Retirement segment is to serve over 5.1 million defined contribution plan participants (as of December 31, 2018), we also seek to capitalize on our access to these individuals by utilizing our Retail Wealth Management business to deepen our relationships with them for the long-term. We believe that our ability to offer an integrated approach to an individual customer’s entire financial picture, while saving for or living in retirement, presents a compelling reason for our Institutional Retirement Plans participants to use us as their principal investment and retirement plan provider. Through our broad range of advisory programs, our financial advisers have access to a wide set of solutions for our customers for building investment portfolios, including stocks, bonds and mutual funds, as well as managed accounts. These experienced advisers work with customers to select a program to meet their financial needs that takes into consideration each individual’s time horizon, goals and attitudes towards risk.
Markets and Distribution
Retail Wealth Management products, financial planning and advisory services are primarily sold through our group of nearly 1,700 representatives licensed through VFA, our broker-dealer. These VFA representatives help provide cohesiveness between our Institutional Retirement Plans and Retail Wealth Management businesses and are grouped into two primary categories: field-based and home office phone-based representatives. Field-based representatives are registered sales and investment advisory representatives that drive both fee-based and commissioned sales. They provide face-to-face interaction with individuals seeking retail investment products (e.g., IRA products) as well as financial planning and advisory solutions. Home office phone-based representatives focus on assisting participants in our institutional retirement plans, primarily for our large recordkeeping plans. While these representatives offer more simplified rollover products and advisory services than offered by the field-based representatives, they are highly trained in providing financial advice that helps customers transition through life stage and job-related changes.
In an effort to develop a path for our VFA representatives to offer holistic retirement planning solutions to participants in our Institutional Retirement Plans, we partner with our institutional clients to engage, educate, advise and motivate their employees to take action that will better prepare them for successful retirement outcomes.
Competition
Our Retail Wealth Management advisory services and product solutions compete for rollover and other asset consolidation opportunities against integrated financial services companies and independent broker-dealers who also offer individual retirement products, all of which currently have more market share than insurance-based providers in this space. Primary competitors to our Retail Wealth Management business are, in the phone-based channel, Fidelity, Schwab, and Vanguard, and in the field-based channel, LPL Financial, Ameriprise, Commonwealth, Cambridge, Cetera, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Our Retail Wealth Management advisory services and product solutions are competitively priced and compete based on our consultative approach, simplicity of design and a fund and investment selection process that includes proprietary and non-proprietary investment options. The advisory services and product solutions are targeted towards existing institutional plan participants, which allow us to benefit from our extensive relationships with large corporate and tax-exempt plan sponsors, our small and mid-corporate market plan sponsors and other qualified plan segments in healthcare, higher education and K-12 education.
Underwriting and Pricing
We price our individual retirement products based on long-term assumptions that include investment returns and operating costs. We establish target returns for each product based upon these factors and the expected amount of regulatory and rating agency capital, to the extent any is required, that we must hold to support these contracts and investment products over their projected lifetime. We monitor and manage pricing and sales mix to achieve target returns. It may take new business several years before it is profitable, depending on the nature and life of the product, and returns are subject to variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions. Where we bear investment risk, we seek to mitigate such risk by actively managing both market and credit risks associated with investments and through asset/liability matching portfolio management.
Investment Management 
We offer domestic and international fixed income, equity, multi-asset and alternatives products and solutions across market sectors, investment styles and capitalization spectrums through our actively managed, full-service investment management business. Multiple investment platforms are backed by a fully integrated business support infrastructure that lowers expense and creates operating efficiencies and business leverage and scalability at low marginal cost. As of December 31, 2018, our Investment Management segment managed $122.2 billion for third-party institutional and individual investors, $24.9 billion in separate account assets for our other businesses (including variable annuity-sourced assets) and $56.3 billion in general account assets. Upon closing of the Transaction, our general account AUM declined by approximately $28 billion, which was offset by approximately $10 billion of additional third-party AUM associated with our management of Venerable's general account assets. See "–Organizational History and Structure–CBVA and Annuity Transaction". We also offer a range of specialty asset solutions across fixed income and alternative investment products with AUM of $66.4 billion for such specialty products.
We are committed to reliable and responsible investing and delivering research-driven, risk-adjusted, specialty and retirement client-oriented investment strategies and solutions and advisory services across asset classes, geographies and investment styles. Through our institutional distribution channel and our Voya-affiliate businesses, we serve a variety of institutional clients, including public, corporate and Taft-Hartley Act defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans, endowments and foundations, and insurance companies. We also serve individual investors by offering our mutual funds and separately managed accounts through an intermediary-focused distribution platform or through affiliate and third-party retirement platforms. 
Investment Management’s primary source of revenue is management fees collected on the assets we manage. These fees are typically based upon a percentage of AUM. In certain investment management fee arrangements, we may also receive performance-based incentive fees when the return on AUM exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance hurdles. In addition, and to a lesser extent, Investment Management collects administrative fees on outside managed assets that are administered by our mutual fund platform, and distributed primarily by our Retirement segment. Investment Management also receives fees as the primary investment manager of our general account, which is managed on a market-based pricing basis. Finally, Investment Management generates revenues from a portfolio of capital investments. Investment Management generated Adjusted operating earnings before income taxes of $205 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The success of our platform begins with providing our clients continued strong investment performance. In addition to investment performance, our focus is on client "solutions" and income and outcome-oriented products which include target date funds. We expect that both our traditional and specialty capabilities, leveraging strong investment performance combined with superior client service, will result in AUM growth. 
We are also focused on capitalizing on the Retirement segment's leading market position and have established dedicated retirement resources within our Investment Management intermediary-focused distribution team to work with Retirement and have enhanced our MASS investment platform (which we describe below) to increase focus on retirement products such as our target date and target risk portfolios, which we believe will help us to capture an increased proportion of retirement flows.
Other key strategic initiatives for growth include continued focus on higher margin specialty capabilities: improved distribution productivity, sub-advisory mandates for Investment Management capabilities on client platforms; leveraging partnerships with financial intermediaries and consultants; opportunistic launching of capital markets products such as collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs") and Closed End Mutual Funds; and prudent expansion of our private equity business.

Investment Management delivers products and services that are manufactured by traditional and specialty investment platforms. The traditional platforms are fixed income, equities and MASS. Our specialty capabilities include investment strategies such as 
senior bank loans, CLOs, private equity and certain fixed income strategies such as private credit, mortgage derivatives and commercial mortgage loans. 
Fixed Income. Investment Management’s fixed income platform manages assets for our general account, as well as for domestic and international institutional and retail investors. As of December 31, 2018, there were $116.3 billion in AUM on the fixed income platform, of which $56.3 billion were general account assets. Through the fixed income platform clients have access to money market funds, investment-grade corporate debt, government bonds, residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS"), commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS"), asset-backed securities ("ABS"), high yield bonds, private and syndicated debt instruments, unconstrained fixed income, commercial mortgages and preferred securities. Each sector within the platform is managed by seasoned investment professionals supported by significant credit, quantitative and macro research and risk management capabilities.
Equities. The equities platform is a multi-cap and multi-style research-driven platform comprising both fundamental and quantitative equity strategies for institutional and retail investors. As of December 31, 2018, there were $51.0 billion in AUM on the equities platform covering both domestic and international markets including Real Estate. Our fundamental equity capabilities are bottom-up and research driven, and cover growth, value, and core strategies in the large, mid and small cap spaces. Our quantitative equity capabilities are used to create quantitative and enhanced indexed strategies, support other fundamental equity analysis, and create extension products.
MASS. Investment Management’s MASS platform offers a variety of investment products and strategies that combine multiple asset classes using asset allocation techniques. The objective of the MASS platform is to develop customized solutions that meet specific, and often unique, goals of investors and that dynamically change over time in response to changing markets and client needs. Utilizing core capabilities in asset allocation, manager selection, asset/liability modeling, risk management and financial engineering, the MASS team has developed a suite of target date and target risk funds that are distributed through our Retirement segment and to institutional and retail investors. These funds can incorporate multi-manager funds. The MASS team also provides pension risk management, strategic and tactical asset allocation, liability-driven investing solutions and investment strategies that hedge out specific market exposures (e.g., portable alpha) for clients.
Senior Bank Loans. Investment Management’s senior bank loan group is an experienced manager of below-investment grade floating-rate loans, actively managing diversified portfolios of loans made by major banks around the world to non-investment grade corporate borrowers. Senior in the capital structure, these loans have a first lien on the borrower’s assets, typically giving them stronger credit support than unsecured corporate bonds. The platform offers institutional, retail and structured products (e.g., CLOs), including on-shore and off-shore vehicles with assets of $25.5 billion as of December 31, 2018.
Alternatives. Investment Management’s primary alternatives platform is Pomona Capital. Pomona Capital specializes in investing in private equity funds in three ways: by purchasing secondary interests in existing partnerships; by investing in new partnerships; and by co-investing alongside buyout funds in individual companies. As of December 31, 2018, Pomona Capital managed assets totaling $8.6 billion across a suite of limited partnerships and the Pomona Investment Fund, a registered investment fund launched in May, 2015 that is available to accredited investors. In addition, Investment Management offers select alternative and hedge funds leveraging our core debt and equity investment capabilities.

(1) | $19.6 billion of MASS assets are included in the fixed income, equity and senior bank loan AUM figures presented above. The balance of MASS assets, $6.2 billion, is managed by third parties and we earn only a modest, market-rate fee on the assets.

(2) Upon closing of the Transaction, our general account AUM declined by approximately $28 billion, which was offset by approximately $10 billion of additional third-party AUM associated with our management of the general account assets of Venerable. See "–Organizational History and Structure–CBVA and Annuity Transaction".
Markets and Distribution
We serve our institutional clients through a dedicated sales and service platform and for certain international regions, through selling agreements with a former affiliated party and for sponsored structured products through the arranger. We serve individual investors through an intermediary-focused distribution platform, consisting of business development and wholesale forces that partner with banks, broker-dealers and independent financial advisers, as well as our affiliate and third-party retirement platforms.
With the exception of Pomona Capital and structured products, the different products and strategies associated with our investment platforms are distributed and serviced by these Retail and Institutional client-focused segments as follows:

• | Retail client segment: Open- and closed-end funds through affiliate and third-party distribution platforms, including wirehouses, brokerage firms, and independent and regional broker-dealers. As of December 31, 2018, total AUM from these channels was $61.3 billion. Included in our retail client segment is $15.9 billion of AUM managed on behalf of Venerable as of December 31, 2018.


• | Institutional client segment: Individual and pooled accounts, targeting defined benefit, defined contribution recordkeeping and retirement plans, Taft Hartley and endowments and foundations. As of December 31, 2018, Investment Management had approximately 342 institutional clients, representing $85.9 billion of AUM primarily in separately managed accounts and collective investment trusts. As a result of the Transaction, we now manage $11.3 billion of AUM for Venerable as an institutional client.

Investment Management manages a variety of variable portfolio, mutual fund and stable value assets, sold through our Retirement and Employee Benefits segments, together with assets that were previously sold through our Individual Life and remaining Annuities businesses. As of December 31, 2018, total AUM from these channels and the divested variable annuity business was 61.6 billion with the majority of the assets gathered through our Retirement segment.
As described above under "–Organizational History and Structure–CBVA and Annuity Transaction" as a result of the Transaction, Voya IM or its affiliated advisors entered agreements to serve as the preferred asset management partner for Venerable.
Competition
Investment Management competes with a wide array of asset managers and institutions in the highly fragmented U.S. investment management industry. In our key market segments, Investment Management competes on the basis of, among other things, investment performance, investment philosophy and process, product features and structure and client service. Our principal competitors include insurance-owned asset managers such as Principal Global Investors (Principal Financial Group), Prudential and Ameriprise, bank-owned asset managers such as J.P. Morgan Asset Management, as well as "pure-play" asset managers including Invesco, Legg Mason, T. Rowe Price, and Franklin Templeton.
Employee Benefits
Our Employee Benefits segment provides group insurance products to mid-size and large corporate employers and professional associations. In addition, our Employee Benefits segment serves the voluntary worksite market by providing individual and payroll-deduction products to employees of our clients. Our Employee Benefits segment is among the largest writers of stop loss coverage in the United States, currently ranking sixth on a premium basis with approximately $969 million of in-force premiums. We also have a fast growing voluntary benefits offering and are a top provider of group life. As of December 31, 2018, Employee Benefits total in-force premiums were $1.9 billion.
The Employee Benefits segment generates revenue from premiums, investment income, mortality and morbidity income and policy and other charges. Profits are driven by the spread between investment income and credited rates to policyholders on voluntary universal life and whole life products, along with the difference between premiums and mortality charges collected and benefits and expenses paid for group life, stop loss and voluntary health benefits. Our Employee Benefits segment generated Adjusted operating earnings before income taxes of $160 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
We believe that our Employee Benefits segment offers attractive growth opportunities. For example, we believe there are significant opportunities through expansion in the voluntary benefits market as employers shift benefits costs to their employees. We have a number of new products and initiatives that we believe will help us drive growth in this market. While expanding these lines, we also intend to continue to focus on profitability in our well established group life and stop loss product lines, by adding profitable new business to our in-force block, improving our persistency by retaining more of our best performing groups, and managing our overall loss ratios to below 74%.
Products and Services
Our Employee Benefits segment offers stop loss insurance, voluntary benefits, and group life and disability products. These offerings are designed to meet the financial needs of both employers and employees by helping employers attract and retain employees and control costs, as well as provide ease of administration and valuable protection for employees.
Stop Loss. Our stop loss insurance provides coverage for mid-sized to large employers that self-insure their medical claims. These employers provide a health plan to their employees and generally pay all plan-related claims and administrative expenses. Our stop loss product helps these employers contain their health expenses by reimbursing specified claim amounts above certain deductibles and by reimbursing claims that exceed a specified limit. We offer this product via two types of protection—individual stop loss insurance and aggregate stop loss insurance. The primary difference between these two types is a varying deductible; both coverages are re-priced and renewable annually.
Voluntary Benefits. Our voluntary benefits business involves the sale of universal life insurance, whole life insurance, critical illness, accident and hospital indemnity insurance. This product lineup is mostly employee-paid through payroll deduction. New products have been introduced that focus on group-like structures that address the cost-shifting trend.
Group Life. Group life products span basic and supplemental term life insurance as well as accidental death and dismemberment for mid-sized to large employers. These products offer employees guaranteed issue coverage, convenient payroll deduction, affordable rates and conversion options.
Group Disability. Group disability includes group long term disability, short term disability, telephonic short term disability, voluntary long term disability and voluntary short term disability products for mid-sized to large employers. This product offering is typically packaged for sale with group life products, especially in the middle-market.
The following chart presents the key employee benefits products we offer, along with data on annualized in-force premiums for each product:

($ in millions) | Annualized In-Force Premiums
Employee Benefits Products | Year Ended December 31, 2018
Stop Loss | $ | 969
Voluntary Benefits | 317 | 
Group Life | 524 | 
Group Disability | 129 | 

Markets and Distribution
Our Employee Benefits segment works primarily with national and regional benefits consultants, brokers, TPAs, enrollment firms and technology partners. Our tenured distribution organization provides local sales and account management support to offer customized solutions to mid-sized to large employers backed by a national accounts team. We offer innovative and flexible solutions to meet the varying and changing needs of our customers and distribution partners. We have many years of experience providing unique stop loss solutions and products for our customers. In addition, we are an experienced multi-line employee benefits insurance carrier (group life, disability, stop loss and elective benefits).
We primarily use three distribution channels to market and sell our employee benefits products. Our largest channel works through hundreds of brokers and consultant firms nationwide and markets our entire product portfolio. Our Voluntary sales team focuses on marketing elective benefits to complement an employer’s overall benefit package. In addition, we market stop-loss coverage to employer sponsors of self-funded employee health benefit plans. Our breadth of distribution gives us access to employers and their employees and the products to meet their needs. When combined with distribution channels used by our Individual Life segment, we are able to provide complete access to our products through worksite-based sales.
The following chart presents our Employee Benefits distribution, by channel:

($ in millions) | Sales | | % of Sales 
Channel | Year Ended December 31, 2018 | | Year Ended December 31, 2018
Brokerage (Commissions Paid) | $ | 295 | | | 66.0 | %
Benefits Consulting Firms (Fee Based Consulting) | 144 | | | 32.3 | % 
Worksite Sales | 7 | | | 1.7 | % 

Competition
The group insurance market is mature and, due to the large number of participants in this segment, price and service are important competitive drivers. Our principal competitors include Tokio Marine HCC (formerly Houston Casualty), Symetra and Sun Life in Stop Loss; Unum, Allstate and Transamerica in voluntary benefits and MetLife, Prudential and Minnesota Life in group life.
For group life insurance products, rate guarantees have become the industry norm, with rate guarantee duration periods trending upward in general. Technology is also a competitive driver, as employers and employees expect technology solutions to streamline their administrative costs.
Underwriting and Pricing
Group insurance and disability pricing reflects the employer group’s claims experience and the risk characteristics of each employer group. The employer’s group claims experience is reviewed at time of policy issuance and periodically thereafter, resulting in ongoing pricing adjustments. The key pricing and underwriting criteria are morbidity and mortality assumptions, the employer group’s demographic composition, the industry, geographic location, regional and national economic trends, plan design and prior claims experience.
Stop loss insurance pricing reflects the risk characteristics and claims experience for each employer group. The product is annually renewable and the underwriting information is reviewed annually as a result. The key pricing and underwriting criteria are medical cost trends, morbidity assumptions, the employer group’s demographic composition, the industry, geographic location, plan design and prior claims experience. Pricing in the stop loss insurance market is generally cyclical.
Reinsurance
Our Employee Benefits reinsurance strategy seeks to limit our exposure to any one individual which will help limit and control risk. Group Life, which includes Accidental Death and Dismemberment, cedes the excess over $750,000 of each coverage to a reinsurer. Group Long Term Disability cedes substantially all of the risk including the claims servicing, to a TPA and reinsurer. As of January 1, 2018, Excess Stop Loss has a reinsurance program in place that limits our exposure on any one specific claim to $3 million, with aggregate stop loss reinsurance that limits our exposure to $3 million over the Policyholder's Aggregate Excess Retention. For policies issued in 2017 and 2016, the limits on any one specific claim are $2.25 million and $2 million, respectively. . For both 2017 and 2016 circumstances, there is aggregate stop loss reinsurance that limits our exposure to $2 million over the Policyholders Aggregate Excess Retention. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Risk Management". We also use an annually renewable reinsurance transaction which lowers required capital of the Employee Benefits segment.
Individual Life
In October 2018, we concluded a strategic review of our Individual Life business and announced that we would cease new individual life insurance sales while retaining our in-force block of individual life policies. Applications for individual life insurance products were accepted through the end of 2018, resulting in some placement of policies in the first quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2018, Individual Life’s in-force book comprised nearly 800 thousand policies and gross premiums and deposits for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $1.8 billion.
The Individual Life segment generates revenue on its products from premiums, investment income, expense load, mortality charges and other policy charges, along with some asset-based fees. Profits are driven by the spread between investment income earned and interest credited to policyholders, plus the difference between premiums and mortality charges collected and benefits and expenses paid. Our Individual Life segment generated Adjusted operating earnings before income taxes of $(33) million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Because we have ceased new sales, future earnings in our Individual Life segment will be driven by effectively managing our in-force block to meet our profitability and capital management objectives, improving our investment margins, and consolidating and simplifying our administrative systems in order to continue to reduce costs. In addition, we will continue to utilize reinsurance to actively manage our risk and capital profile with the goal of controlling exposure to losses, reducing volatility and protecting capital. We aim to maximize earnings and capital efficiency in part by relieving the reserve strain for certain of our term and universal life products by means of reinsurance arrangements and other financing transactions. We also look for opportunities to transfer certain blocks of business through reinsurance in order to more effectively manage our capital. For example, in 2015 and 2014 we reinsured two in-force blocks comprising approximately 325,000 term life insurance policies, representing approximately $190 billion of life insurance in-force and backed by approximately $2.7 billion in statutory reserves, to a third-party reinsurer.
Products and Services
Although new sales have ceased, our Individual Life segment will continue to offer certain permanent products for conversion of existing in-force term policies. We have historically offered products that included indexed universal life, ("IUL"), universal life ("UL"), and variable universal life ("VUL") insurance. 
The following chart presents data on our remaining in-force face amount and total gross premiums and deposits received by product:

 | In-Force Face | | Total gross premiums
($ in millions) | Amount | | and deposits 
 | As of | | Year Ended 
Individual Life Product | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2018 
Term Life | $ | 231,865 | | | $ | 520
Indexed Universal Life | 25,364 | | | 465 | 
Other Universal Life | 56,970 | | | 684 | 
Variable Universal Life | 20,146 | | | 138 | 

Reinsurance
In general, our reinsurance strategy is designed to limit our mortality risk and effectively manage capital. We partner with highly rated, well regarded reinsurers and set up pools to share our excess mortality risk.
As of January 1, 2013, for term business, we retain the first $3 million of risk and the excess risk is shared among a pool of reinsurers. For most of our universal life product portfolio, we retain the first $5 million of risk and reinsure 100% of the excess over $5 million among a pool of reinsurers. For policies sold to foreign nationals, we retain 20% of risk and the remaining 80% of risk is shared among a pool of reinsurers. Our maximum overall retained risk on any one life is $5 million. Prior to January 1, 2013, our retention limits for most of the universal life product portfolio and the maximum overall retained risk on any one life were higher than the current limits.
Since 2006, reinsurance for new business was on a monthly renewable term basis, which only transfers mortality risk and limits our counterparty risk exposure. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Risk Management".
CBVA and Annuities Businesses
As described under "–Organizational History and Structure–CBVA and Annuity Transaction", on June 1, 2018, we completed a transaction to dispose of substantially all of our CBVA and Fixed and Fixed Indexed Annuities businesses and related assets. Certain investment-only products in our former Annuities segment were retained by us and are managed in our Retirement segment, and we retained a small amount of existing variable and fixed annuities businesses, which is managed in Corporate. See also Overview in the Management's Discussion and Analyses section in Part II, Item 7. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 6,000 employees, with most working in one of our ten major sites in nine states.
REGULATION 
Our operations and businesses are subject to a significant number of Federal and state laws, regulations, and administrative determinations. Following is a description of certain legal and regulatory frameworks to which we or our subsidiaries are or may be subject.
Voya Financial, Inc. is a holding company for all of our business operations, which we conduct through our subsidiaries. Voya Financial, Inc. is not licensed as an insurer, investment advisor or broker-dealer but, because we own regulated insurers, we are subject to regulation as an insurance holding company.
Insurance Regulation
Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision under U.S. state and federal laws. Each U.S. state, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories and possessions have insurance laws that apply to companies licensed to carry on an insurance business in the jurisdiction. The primary regulator of an insurance company, however, is located in its state of domicile. Each of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and regulated in each state where it conducts insurance business.
State insurance regulators have broad administrative powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business including: licensing to transact business, licensing agents, admittance of assets to statutory surplus, regulating premium rates for certain insurance products, approving policy forms, regulating unfair trade and claims practices, establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards, establishing credit for reinsurance requirements, fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum accumulation or surrender values and other matters. State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing the marketplace conduct of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosures to consumers, product illustrations, advertising, product replacement, suitability, sales and underwriting practices, complaint handling and claims handling. State regulators enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations. State insurance laws and regulations regulating affiliate transactions, the payment of dividends and change of control transactions are discussed in greater detail below.
Our three principal insurance subsidiaries, SLD, VRIAC, and RLI (which we refer to collectively as our "Principal Insurance Subsidiaries") are domiciled in Colorado, Connecticut and Minnesota, respectively. Our other U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in Indiana and New York. Our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Minnesota and New York are collectively referred to as "our insurance subsidiaries" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for purposes of discussions of U.S. insurance regulatory matters. In addition, we have special purpose life reinsurance captive insurance company subsidiaries domiciled in Missouri that provide reinsurance to our insurance subsidiaries in order to facilitate the financing of statutory reserve requirements associated with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") Model Regulation entitled "Valuation of Life Insurance Policies" (commonly known as "Regulation XXX" or "XXX"), or NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (commonly known as "AG38" or "AXXX"). Our special purpose life reinsurance captive insurance company subsidiaries domiciled in Missouri are collectively referred to as our "Missouri captives" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We also have captive reinsurance subsidiaries domiciled in Arizona that provide reinsurance to our insurance subsidiaries for specific blocks of business. Our captive reinsurance subsidiaries domiciled in Arizona are referred to as our "Arizona captives" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We refer to our Missouri captives and our Arizona captives collectively as our "captive reinsurance subsidiaries. For more information on our use of captive reinsurance structures, see "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Facilities and Subsidiary Credit Support Arrangements". 
State insurance laws and regulations require our insurance subsidiaries to file financial statements with state insurance regulators everywhere they are licensed and the operations of our insurance subsidiaries and accounts are subject to examination by those regulators at any time. Our insurance subsidiaries prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices and procedures developed by regulators to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurance companies and their ability to pay current and future policyholder obligations. The NAIC has approved these uniform statutory accounting principles ("SAP") which have in turn been adopted, in some cases with minor modifications, by all state insurance regulators.
Our Missouri captives are required to file financial statements with the Missouri Insurance Department, including statutory financial statements. Our Arizona captives are required to file financial statements with the Arizona Department of Insurance ("ADOI") on either a statutory basis or a U.S. GAAP basis, and our Arizona captives have received permission to prepare their financial statements on a U.S. GAAP basis, modified for certain prescribed practices outlined in the Arizona insurance statutes. In addition, our Arizona captives have obtained approval from the ADOI for certain permitted practices, including, for SLDI, taking reinsurance credit for certain ceded reserves where the trust assets backing the liabilities are held by one of our wholly owned insurance companies. SLDI has recorded a receivable for these assets held in trust by its affiliate. 
Our insurance subsidiaries, including our captive reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic financial examinations and other inquiries and investigations by their respective domiciliary state insurance regulators and other state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general.
Captive Reinsurer Regulation
State insurance regulators, the NAIC and other regulatory bodies have been investigating the use of affiliated captive reinsurers and offshore entities to reinsure insurance risks, and the NAIC has made recent advances in captives reform.
In 2014, the NAIC considered a proposal to require states to apply NAIC accreditation standards, applicable to traditional insurers, to captive reinsurers. In 2015, the NAIC adopted such a proposal, in the form of a revised preamble to the NAIC accreditation standards (the "Standard"), with an effective date of January 1, 2016 for application of the Standard to captives that assume XXX or AXXX business. Under the Standard, a state will be deemed in compliance as it relates to XXX or AXXX captives if the applicable reinsurance transaction satisfies the NAIC's Actuarial Guideline 48 ("AG48"), which limits the type of assets that may be used as collateral to cover the XXX and AG38 statutory reserves. The Standard applies prospectively, so that XXX or AXXX 
captives will not be subject to the Standard if reinsured policies were issued prior to January 1, 2015 and ceded so that they were part of a reinsurance arrangement as of December 31, 2014. The NAIC left for future action application of the Standard to captives that assume variable annuity business. 
Insurance Holding Company Regulation
Voya Financial, Inc. and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance holding companies laws of the states in which such insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance regulator in the insurance company’s state of domicile and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system. Generally, all transactions affecting the insurers in the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and, if material, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the state’s insurance regulator. Our captive reinsurance subsidiaries are not subject to insurance holding company laws.
Change of Control. State insurance holding company regulations generally provide that no person, corporation or other entity may acquire control of an insurance company, or a controlling interest in any parent company of an insurance company, without the prior approval of such insurance company's domiciliary state insurance regulator. Under the laws of each of the domiciliary states of our insurance subsidiaries, any person acquiring, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company is presumed to have acquired "control" of the company. This statutory presumption of control may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact. The state insurance regulators, however, may find that "control" exists in circumstances in which a person owns or controls less than 10% of voting securities.
To obtain approval of any change in control, the proposed acquirer must file with the applicable insurance regulator an application disclosing, among other information, its background, financial condition, the financial condition of its affiliates, the source and amount of funds by which it will effect the acquisition, the criteria used in determining the nature and amount of consideration to be paid for the acquisition, proposed changes in the management and operations of the insurance company and other related matters.

Any purchaser of shares of common stock representing 10% or more of the voting power of our capital stock will be presumed to have acquired control of our insurance subsidiaries unless, following application by that purchaser in each insurance subsidiary's state of domicile, the relevant insurance commissioner determines otherwise.
The licensing orders governing our captive reinsurance subsidiaries provide that any change of control requires the approval of such company’s domiciliary state insurance regulator. Although our captive reinsurance subsidiaries are not subject to insurance holding company laws, their domiciliary state insurance regulators may use all or a part of the holding company law framework described above in determining whether to approve a proposed change of control.
NAIC Regulations. The current insurance holding company model act and regulations (the "NAIC Regulations"), versions of which have been adopted by our insurance subsidiaries' domicile states, include a requirement that an insurance holding company system’s ultimate controlling person submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an "enterprise risk report" that identifies activities, circumstances or events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied properly, are likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. The NAIC Regulations also include a provision requiring a controlling person to submit prior notice to its domiciliary insurance regulator of a divestiture of control. Each of the states of domicile for our insurance subsidiaries has adopted its version of the NAIC Regulations.
The NAIC's "Solvency Modernization Initiative" focuses on: (1) capital requirements; (2) corporate governance and risk management; (3) group supervision; (4) statutory accounting and financial reporting; and (5) reinsurance. This initiative resulted in the adoption by the NAIC, and our insurance subsidiaries' domicile states, of the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act ("ORSA"). ORSA requires that insurers maintain a risk management framework and conduct an internal own risk and solvency assessment of the insurer's material risks in normal and stressed environments. The assessment must be documented in a confidential annual summary report, a copy of which must be made available to regulators as required or upon request. In accordance with statutory requirements, Voya Financial regularly prepares and submits ORSA summary reports. This initiative also resulted in the adoption by the NAIC and several of our insurance subsidiary domiciliary regulators of the Corporate Governance Annual Filing Model Act, which requires insurers, including Voya Financial, to make an annual confidential filing regarding their corporate governance policies. 
Dividend Payment Restrictions. As a holding company with no significant business operations of our own, we depend on dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries as the principal source of cash to meet our obligations, including the payment of interest on, and repayment of principal of, our outstanding debt obligations. The states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled impose certain restrictions on such subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends to us. These restrictions are based in part on the prior year’s statutory income and surplus. In general, dividends up to specified levels are considered ordinary and may be paid without prior approval. Dividends in larger amounts, or extraordinary dividends, are subject to approval by the insurance commissioner of the state of domicile of the insurance subsidiary proposing to pay the dividend.
For a summary of ordinary dividends and extraordinary distributions paid by each of our Principal Insurance Subsidiaries to Voya Financial or Voya Holdings in 2017 and 2018, and a discussion of ordinary dividend capacity for 2018, see "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Restrictions on Dividends and Returns of Capital from Subsidiaries". 
Our Missouri captives may not declare or pay dividends in any form to us other than in accordance with their respective insurance securitization transaction agreements and their respective governing license orders. Likewise, our Arizona captives may not declare or pay dividends in any form to us other than in accordance with their annual capital and dividend plans as approved by the ADOI which include minimum capital requirements. 
Approval by a captive's domiciliary insurance regulator of an ongoing plan for the payment of dividends or other distribution is conditioned upon the retention, at the time of each payment, of capital or surplus equal to or in excess of amounts specified by, or determined in accordance with formulas approved for the captive by its domiciliary insurance regulator.
Financial Regulation
Policy and Contract Reserve Sufficiency Analysis. Under the laws and regulations of their states of domicile, our insurance subsidiaries are required to conduct annual analyses of the sufficiency of their statutory reserves. Other jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries are licensed may have certain reserve requirements that differ from those of their domiciliary jurisdictions. In each case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion that states that the aggregate statutory reserves, when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such reserves, are sufficient to meet the insurer’s contractual obligations and related expenses. If such an opinion cannot be rendered, the affected insurer must set up additional statutory reserves by moving funds from available statutory surplus. Our insurance subsidiaries submit these opinions annually to applicable insurance regulatory authorities.
Surplus and Capital Requirements. Insurance regulators have the discretionary authority, in connection with the ongoing licensing of our insurance subsidiaries, to limit or prohibit the ability of an insurer to issue new policies if, in the regulators' judgment, the insurer is not maintaining a minimum amount of surplus or is in hazardous financial condition. Insurance regulators may also limit the ability of an insurer to issue new life insurance policies and annuity contracts above an amount based upon the face amount and premiums of policies of a similar type issued in the prior year. We do not currently believe that the current or anticipated levels of statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries present a material risk that any such regulator would limit the amount of new policies that our Principal Insurance Subsidiaries may issue.
Risk-Based Capital. The NAIC has adopted RBC requirements for life, health and property and casualty insurance companies. The requirements provide a method for analyzing the minimum amount of adjusted capital (statutory capital and surplus plus other adjustments) appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, taking into account the risk characteristics of the company’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. State insurance regulators use the RBC requirements as an early warning tool to identify possibly inadequately capitalized insurers. An insurance company found to have insufficient statutory capital based on its RBC ratio may be subject to varying levels of additional regulatory oversight depending on the level of capital inadequacy. As of December 31, 2018, the RBC of each of our insurance subsidiaries exceeded statutory minimum RBC levels that would require any regulatory or corrective action.
As a result of the federal tax legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017 ("Tax Reform"), the NAIC updated the factors affecting RBC requirements, including ours, to reflect the lowering of the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Adjusting these factors in light of Tax Reform resulted in an increase in the amount of capital we are required to maintain to satisfy our RBC requirements. 
The NAIC is currently working with the American Academy of Actuaries as they consider possible updates to the asset factors that are used to calculate the RBC requirements for investment portfolio assets. The NAIC review may lead to an expansion in the number of NAIC asset class categories for factor-based RBC requirements and the adoption of new factors, which could increase capital requirements on some securities and decrease capital requirements on others. We cannot predict what, if any, 
changes may result from this review or their potential impact on the RBC ratios of our insurance subsidiaries that are subject to RBC requirements. We will continue to monitor developments in this area.
IRIS Tests. The NAIC has developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System ("IRIS") to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of U.S. insurance companies and identifying companies requiring special attention or action. For IRIS ratio purposes, our Principal Insurance Subsidiaries submit data to the NAIC on an annual basis. The NAIC analyzes this data using prescribed financial data ratios. A ratio falling outside the prescribed "usual range" is not considered a failing result. Rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. In many cases, it is not unusual for financially sound companies to have one or more ratios that fall outside the usual range. 
Regulators typically investigate or monitor an insurance company if its IRIS ratios fall outside the prescribed usual range for four or more of the ratios, but each state has the right to inquire about any ratios falling outside the usual range. The inquiries made by state insurance regulators into an insurance company’s IRIS ratios can take various forms.
We do not anticipate regulatory action as a result of our 2018 IRIS ratio results. In all instances in prior years, regulators have been satisfied upon follow-up that no regulatory action was required. 
Insurance Guaranty Associations. Each state has insurance guaranty association laws that require insurance companies doing business in the state to participate in various types of guaranty associations or other similar arrangements. The laws are designed to protect policyholders from losses under insurance policies issued by insurance companies that become impaired or insolvent. Typically, these associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on member insurers on the basis of the member insurer’s proportionate share of the business in the relevant jurisdiction in the lines of business in which the impaired or insolvent insurer is engaged. Some jurisdictions permit member insurers to recover assessments that they paid through full or partial premium tax offsets, usually over a period of years.
Cybersecurity Regulatory Activity
The NAIC, numerous state and federal regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations like FINRA are focused on cybersecurity standards both for the financial services industry and for all companies that collect personal information, and have proposed and enacted legislation and regulations, and issued guidance regarding cybersecurity standards and protocols. For example, in February 2017, the New York Department of Financial Services ("NYDFS") issued final Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies that required banks, insurance companies, and other financial services institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including us, to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program "designed to protect consumers and ensure the safety and soundness of New York State's financial services industry". In 2018, South Carolina, Ohio and Michigan adopted versions of the NAIC Insurance Data Security Model Law. These laws, with effective dates ranging from January 1, 2019 to January 20, 2021, ensure that licensees of the Departments of Insurance in these states have strong and aggressive cybersecurity programs to protect the personal data of their customers. During 2019, we expect cybersecurity risk management, prioritization and reporting to continue to be an area of significant focus by governments, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations at all levels.
Securities Regulation Affecting Insurance Operations
Certain of our insurance subsidiaries sell variable life insurance and group variable annuities that are registered with and regulated by the SEC as securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). These products are issued through separate accounts that are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act, and are regulated by state law. Each separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is itself a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"). Our mutual funds, and in certain states, our variable life insurance and variable annuity products, are subject to filing and other requirements under state securities laws. Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors and generally grant broad rulemaking and enforcement powers to regulatory agencies.
In April 2018, the SEC published a proposed rule that would, among other things, apply a heightened "best interest" standard to broker-dealers and their associated persons when they make securities investment recommendations to retail customers. If the SEC finalizes this rule, other federal regulators and state regulators may follow with their own rules applicable to investment recommendations relating to other separate or overlapping investment products and accounts, such as insurance products and retirement accounts. 
Federal Initiatives Affecting Insurance Operations
The U.S. federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business. Federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly affect insurance companies. These areas include federal pension regulation, financial services regulation, federal tax laws relating to life insurance companies and their products and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the "Patriot Act") requiring, among other things, the establishment of anti-money laundering monitoring programs.
Regulation of Investment and Retirement Products and Services
Our investment, asset management and retirement products and services are subject to federal and state tax, securities, fiduciary (including the Employment Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA")), insurance and other laws and regulations. The SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"), the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC"), state securities commissions, state banking and insurance departments and the Department of Labor ("DOL") and the Treasury Department are the principal regulators that regulate these products and services. 
Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets and generally grant regulatory agencies broad enforcement and rulemaking powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business in the event of non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Federal and state securities regulatory authorities and FINRA from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations regarding compliance by us and our subsidiaries with securities and other laws and regulations.
Securities Regulation with Respect to Certain Insurance and Investment Products and Services 
Our variable life insurance and mutual fund products, and certain of our group variable annuities, are generally "securities" within the meaning of, and registered under, the federal securities laws, and are subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA. Our mutual funds, and in certain states our variable life insurance and certain group variable annuity products, are also "securities" within the meaning of state securities laws. As securities, these products are subject to filing and certain other requirements. Sales activities with respect to these products are generally subject to state securities regulation, which may affect investment advice, sales and related activities for these products.
Broker-Dealers and Investment Advisers
Our securities operations, principally conducted by a number of SEC-registered broker-dealers, are subject to federal and state securities, commodities and related laws, and are regulated principally by the SEC, the CFTC, state securities authorities, FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and similar authorities. Agents and employees registered or associated with any of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and to regulation and examination by the SEC, FINRA and state securities commissioners. The SEC and other governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the United States, have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of the regulated entity or its employees.
Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover many aspects of the securities business, including, among other things, sales methods and trading practices, the suitability of investments for individual customers, the use and safekeeping of customers’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping, financial reporting and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. The federal securities laws may also require, upon a change in control, re-approval by shareholders in registered investment companies of the investment advisory contracts governing management of those investment companies, including mutual funds included in annuity products. Investment advisory clients may also need to approve, or consent to, investment advisory agreements upon a change in control. In addition, broker-dealers are required to make certain monthly and annual filings with FINRA, including monthly FOCUS reports (which include, among other things, financial results and net capital calculations) and annual audited financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
As registered broker-dealers and members of various self-regulatory organizations, our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the SEC’s Net Capital Rule, which specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer is required to maintain and requires a minimum part of its assets to be kept in relatively liquid form. These net capital requirements are designed to measure the financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. The net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of preventing a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and may require that prior notice to the regulators be provided prior to making capital withdrawals. Compliance with net capital requirements could limit operations that require the intensive 
use of capital, such as trading activities and underwriting, and may limit the ability of our broker-dealer subsidiaries to pay dividends to us.
Some of our subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Advisers Act") and provide advice to registered investment companies, including mutual funds used in our annuity products, as well as an array of other institutional and retail clients. The Investment Advisers Act and Investment Company Act may require that fund shareholders be asked to approve new investment advisory contracts with respect to those registered investment companies upon a change in control of a fund’s adviser. Likewise, the Investment Advisers Act may require that other clients consent to the continuance of the advisory contract upon a change in control of the adviser. 
The commodity futures and commodity options industry in the United States is subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the "Commodity Exchange Act"). The CFTC is charged with the administration of the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations adopted under that Act. Some of our subsidiaries are registered with the CFTC as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors. Our futures business is also regulated by the National Futures Association.
Employee Retirement Income Security Act Considerations
ERISA is a comprehensive federal statute that applies to U.S. employee benefit plans sponsored by private employers and labor unions. Plans subject to ERISA include pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans, including health, life and disability plans. Among other things, ERISA imposes reporting and disclosure obligations, prescribes standards of conduct that apply to plan fiduciaries and prohibits transactions known as "prohibited transactions," such as conflict-of-interest transactions, self-dealing and certain transactions between a benefit plan and a party in interest. ERISA also provides for a scheme of civil and criminal penalties and enforcement. Our insurance, investment management and retirement businesses provide services to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA, including limited services under specific contracts where we may act as an ERISA fiduciary. We are also subject to ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules for transactions with ERISA plans, which may affect our ability to, or the terms upon which we may, enter into transactions with those plans, even in businesses unrelated to those giving rise to party in interest status. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code are subject to enforcement by the DOL, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC").
Trust Activities Regulation
Voya Institutional Trust Company ("VITC"), our wholly owned subsidiary, was formed in 2014 as a trust bank chartered by the Connecticut Department of Banking and is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Connecticut Department of Banking. VITC is not permitted to, and does not, accept deposits (other than incidental to its trust and custodial activities). VITC’s activities are primarily to serve as trustee or custodian for retirement plans or IRAs. 
Voya Investment Trust Co., our wholly owned subsidiary, is a limited purpose trust company chartered with the Connecticut Department of Banking. Voya Investment Trust Co. is not permitted to, and does not, accept deposits (other than incidental to its trust activities). Voya Investment Trust Co.'s activities are primarily to serve as trustee for and manage various collective and common trust funds. Voya Investment Trust Co. is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Connecticut Banking Commissioner and is subject to state fiduciary duty laws. In addition, the collective trust funds managed by Voya Investment Trust Co. are generally subject to ERISA.
Other Laws and Regulations
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
The Dodd-Frank Act creates a framework for regulating over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives which has transformed derivatives markets and trading in significant ways. Under the new regulatory regime and subject to certain exceptions, certain standardized OTC interest rate and credit derivatives must now be cleared through a centralized clearinghouse and executed on a centralized exchange or execution facility, and the CFTC and the SEC may designate additional types of OTC derivatives for mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements in the future. In addition to mandatory central clearing of certain derivatives products, non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives which have been excluded from the clearing mandate and which are used by market participants like us are now subject to additional regulatory reporting and margin requirements. Specifically, both the CFTC and federal banking regulators issued final rules in 2015, which became effective in 2017, establishing minimum margin requirements for OTC derivatives traded by either (non-bank) swap dealers or banks which qualify as swaps entities. Nearly all of the counterparties we trade with are either swap dealers or swap entities subject to these rules. Both the CFTC and prudential regulator margin rules require mandatory exchange of variation margin for most OTC derivatives transacted by us and will require exchange of initial margin commencing in 2020. As a result of the transition to central clearing and the new margin requirements for OTC derivatives, we will be required to hold more cash and highly liquid securities resulting in lower yields in order to satisfy the projected increase in margin required. In addition, increased capital charges imposed by regulators on non-cash collateral held by bank counterparties and central clearinghouses is expected to result in higher hedging costs, causing a reduction in income from investments. We are also observing an increasing reluctance from counterparties to accept certain non-cash collateral from us due to higher capital or operational costs associated with such asset classes that we typically hold in abundance. These developments present potentially significant business, liquidity and operational risk for us which could materially and adversely impact both the cost and our ability to effectively hedge various risks, including equity, interest rate, currency and duration risks within many of our insurance and annuity products and investment portfolios. In addition, inconsistencies between U.S. rules and regulations and parallel regimes in other jurisdictions, such as the EU, may further increase costs of hedging or inhibit our ability to access market liquidity in those other jurisdictions.
USA Patriot Act
The Patriot Act contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance companies. The Patriot Act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the United States contain provisions that may be different, conflicting or more rigorous. Internal practices, procedures and controls are required to meet the increased obligations of financial institutions to identify their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies and share information with other financial institutions.
We are also required to follow certain economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control that prohibit or restrict transactions with suspected countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals. We are also subject to regulations governing bribery and other anti-corruption measures.
Privacy Laws and Regulation
U.S. federal and state laws and regulations require all companies generally, and financial institutions, including insurance companies in particular, to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information and to notify consumers about their policies and practices relating to their collection, use, and disclosure of consumer information and the protection of the security and confidentiality of that information. The collection, use, disclosure and security of protected health information is also governed by federal and state laws. Federal and state laws also require notice to affected individuals, law enforcement, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain personal information, including social security numbers, and require holders of certain personal information to protect the security of the data. Federal regulations require financial institutions to implement effective programs to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft. Federal and state laws and regulations regulate the ability of financial institutions to make telemarketing calls and to send unsolicited e-mail or fax messages to consumers and customers. Federal laws and regulations also regulate the permissible uses of certain types of personal information, including consumer report information. Federal and state governments and regulatory bodies may consider additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects. Numerous state regulatory bodies are focused on privacy requirements for all companies that collect personal information and have proposed and enacted legislation and regulations regarding privacy standards and protocols. For example, on June 28, 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, which will take effect on January 1, 2020. We continue to evaluate this 
legislation and its potential impact on our operations, but depending on its implementation, we and other covered businesses may be required to incur significant expense in order to meet its requirements. 
Environmental Considerations
Our ownership and operation of real property and properties within our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Risks of hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any required clean-up are inherent in owning and operating real property. Under the laws of certain states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of clean-up, which could adversely affect the valuation of, and increase the liabilities associated with, the commercial mortgage loans we hold. In several states, this lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against such property. In addition, we may be liable, in certain circumstances, as an "owner" or "operator," for costs of cleaning-up releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at a property mortgaged to us under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and the laws of certain states. Application of various other federal and state environmental laws could also result in the imposition of liability on us for costs associated with environmental hazards.
We routinely conduct environmental assessments prior to closing any new commercial mortgage loans or to taking title to real estate. Although unexpected environmental liabilities can always arise, we seek to minimize this risk by undertaking these environmental assessments and complying with our internal environmental policies and procedures.
Health Care Reform
In March 2010, President Obama signed into Law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was subsequently amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, the "Health Care Act"). The Health Care Act regulates coverage that must be provided under employer-sponsored health care plans, which in turn affects the coverage we provide on our Excess Risk Insurance products. There is significant uncertainty surrounding the current administration's efforts to repeal and replace the Health Care Act. Future changes to, or de-funding of, the Health Care Act could result in increased insurance regulatory activity at the state level, which could negatively affect our Employee Benefits segment.
