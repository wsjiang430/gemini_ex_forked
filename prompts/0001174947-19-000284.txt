Item 1. Business
General Description
 
First Bancorp (the “Company”) is the fourth largest bank holding company headquartered in North Carolina.  At December 31, 2018, the Company had total consolidated assets of $5.9 billion, total loans of $4.2 billion, total deposits of $4.7 billion, and shareholders’ equity of $0.8 billion.  Our principal activity is the ownership and operation of First Bank (the “Bank”), a state-chartered bank with its main office in Southern Pines, North Carolina. 
 
The Company was incorporated in North Carolina on December 8, 1983, as Montgomery Bancorp, for the purpose of acquiring 100% of the outstanding common stock of the Bank through a stock-for-stock exchange. On December 31, 1986, the Company changed its name to First Bancorp to conform its name to the name of the Bank, which had changed its name from Bank of Montgomery to First Bank in 1985.
 
The Bank was organized in 1934 and began banking operations in 1935 as the Bank of Montgomery, named for the county in which it operated. Until September 2013, the Bank’s main office was in Troy, North Carolina, located in the center of Montgomery County. In September 2013, the Company and the Bank moved their main offices approximately 45 miles to Southern Pines, North Carolina, in Moore County. As of December 31, 2018, we conducted business from 101 branches covering a geographical area from Florence, South Carolina to the south, to Wilmington, North Carolina to the east, to Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina to the northeast, to Mayodan, North Carolina to the north, and to Asheville, North Carolina to the west. Of the Bank’s 101 branches, 95 branches are in North Carolina and six branches are in South Carolina. Ranked by assets, the Bank was the fourth largest bank headquartered in North Carolina as of December 31, 2018 and the only one with total assets between $4 billion and $35 billion.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had three wholly owned subsidiaries, First Bank Insurance Services, Inc. (“First Bank Insurance”), SBA Complete, Inc. (“SBA Complete”), and First Troy SPE, LLC. First Bank Insurance’s primary business activity is the placement of property and casualty insurance coverage. SBA Complete specializes in providing consulting services for financial institutions across the country related to Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loan origination and servicing. First Troy SPE, LLC, which was organized in December 2009, is a holding entity for certain foreclosed properties.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 300 SW Broad Street, Southern Pines, North Carolina, 28387, and our telephone number is (910) 246-2500. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this annual report on Form 10-K shall mean collectively First Bancorp and its consolidated subsidiaries.

General Business
 
We engage in a full range of banking activities, with the acceptance of deposits and the making of loans being our most basic activities. We offer deposit products such as checking, savings, and money market accounts, as well as time deposits, including various types of certificates of deposits (“CDs”) and individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). We provide loans for a wide range of consumer and commercial purposes, including loans for business, real estate, personal uses, home improvement and automobiles. We offer residential mortgages through our Mortgage Banking Division, and we offer SBA loans to small business owners across the nation through our SBA Lending Division. We also offer credit cards, debit cards, letters of credit, safe deposit box rentals and electronic funds transfer services, including wire transfers. In addition, we offer internet banking, mobile banking, cash management and bank-by-phone capabilities to our customers, and are affiliated with ATM networks that give our customers access to thousands of ATMs across the country, with no surcharge fee. We also offer a mobile check deposit feature for our mobile banking customers that allows them to securely deposit checks via their smartphone. For our business customers, we offer remote deposit capture, which provides them with a method to electronically transmit checks received from customers into their bank account without having to visit a branch. We are a member of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”), which gives our customers the ability to obtain Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance on deposits of up to $50 million, while continuing to work directly with their local First Bank branch.
 
Because the majority of our customers are individuals and small to medium-sized businesses located in the markets we serve, management does not believe that the loss of a single customer or group of customers would have a material adverse impact on the Bank. There are no seasonal factors that tend to have any material effect on the Bank’s business, and we do not rely on foreign sources of funds or income. Because we operate primarily within North Carolina and northeastern South Carolina, the economic conditions of these areas could have a material impact on the Company. See additional discussion below in the section entitled “Territory Served and Competition.”
 
We also offer various ancillary services as part of our commitment to customer service. Through First Bank Insurance, we offer the placement of property and casualty insurance. We also offer non-FDIC insured investment and insurance products, including mutual funds, annuities, long-term care insurance, life insurance, and company retirement plans, as well as financial planning services through our investments division called FB Wealth Management Services.
 
First Bank also offers SBA loans to small business owners throughout the nation, which is supported by First Bank’s subsidiary, SBA Complete. SBA Complete specializes in providing consulting services for financial institutions across the country related to SBA loan origination and servicing.
 
The Company is also the parent to a series of statutory business trusts organized for the purpose of issuing trust preferred debt securities that qualify as regulatory capital. See additional discussion below in the section entitled “Borrowings.”

Territory Served and Competition
 
Our headquarters are located in Southern Pines, Moore County, North Carolina, where we have a significant concentration of deposits. At the end of 2018, we served regions spread across North Carolina, with additional operations in northeastern South Carolina. The following table presents, for each county where we operated as of December 31, 2018, the number of bank branches operated by the Bank within the county, the approximate amount of deposits with the Bank in the county as of December 31, 2018, our approximate deposit market share at June 30, 2018, and the number of bank competitors located in the county at June 30, 2018.

Historically, our branches and facilities have been primarily located in small to medium-sized communities, whose economies are based primarily on a variety of industries, including services and manufacturing. Leading producers of lumber and rugs are located in Montgomery County, North Carolina. The Pinehurst area within Moore County, North Carolina, is a widely known golf resort and retirement area. The High Point, North Carolina area is widely known for its furniture market. New Hanover and Brunswick Counties, located in the southeastern coastal region of North Carolina, are popular with tourists and have significant retirement populations. Buncombe County, located in the western region of North Carolina, is a highly diverse area with industries in manufacturing, service, and tourism. Additionally, several of the communities served by the Bank are “bedroom” communities of large cities like Charlotte, Raleigh and Greensboro, while several branches are located in medium-sized cities such as Albemarle, Asheboro, Fayetteville, Greenville, Jacksonville, High Point, Southern Pines, and Sanford.

In recent years, we have implemented a branch strategy of expansion into larger, higher growth markets. In 2016, this expansion continued with additional investments in Charlotte, Raleigh and the Triad region of North Carolina. Several seasoned bankers joined the Bank and have led our expansion efforts in these markets. We opened our first full service branch in Charlotte in August 2016, after opening a loan production office there in 2015. In Raleigh, we opened a loan production office early in 2016 and upgraded that location to a full service branch in April 2017. In the Triad region, experienced bankers joined us in early 2016 as we opened our first loan production office in Greensboro. Our expansion into higher growth markets was significantly enhanced by three strategic transactions that we implemented in 2016 and 2017. See discussion below in the section entitled “Mergers and Acquisitions.”
 
We have three counties that hold significant shares of our deposit base. Buncombe County, the former headquarters of one of our 2017 acquisitions (Asheville Savings Bank), holds 12% of our total deposit base. Moore County, the headquarters of the Company, has total deposits comprising approximately 10% of our deposit base, while Guilford County, the former headquarters of another 2017 acquisition (Carolina Bank), also holds 10% of our deposit base. Accordingly, material changes in competition, the economy or the population of these counties could materially impact the Company. No other county comprises more than 10% of our deposit base.
 
We compete in our various market areas with, among others, several large interstate bank holding companies. These large competitors have substantially greater resources than our Company, including broader geographic markets, higher lending limits and the ability to make greater use of large-scale advertising and promotions. A significant number of interstate banking acquisitions have taken place in the past few years, thus further increasing the size and financial resources of some of our competitors, some of which are among the largest bank holding companies in the nation. In many of our markets, we also compete against smaller, local banks. With banks of all sizes attempting to maximize yields on earning assets, the competition for high-quality loans remains intense. Accordingly, loan rates in our markets continue to be under competitive pressure. Also, with the continued interest rate increases initiated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”), the competitive pressure on increasing rates on deposits has intensified. Many of the markets we operate in are particularly competitive markets, with at least ten other financial institutions having a physical presence within those markets.
 
We compete not only against banking organizations, but also against a wide range of financial service providers, including federally and state-chartered thrift institutions, credit unions, investment and brokerage firms and small-loan or consumer finance companies. One of the credit unions in our market area is among the largest in the nation. Competition among financial institutions of all types is virtually unlimited with respect to legal ability and authority to provide most financial services. We also experience competition from internet loan providers, especially for mortgage loans, and from internet banks, particularly in the area of time deposits.
 
Despite the competitive market, we believe we have certain advantages over our competition in the areas we serve. We are large enough to be able to more easily absorb higher costs being experienced in the banking industry, particularly regulatory costs and technology costs, than the smaller banks with which we compete. We are also able to originate significantly larger loans than many of our smaller bank competitors. At the same time, we attempt to maintain a banking culture associated with smaller banks – a culture that has a personal and local flavor that appeals to many retail and small business customers. Specifically, we seek to maintain a distinct local identity in each of the communities we serve and we actively sponsor and participate in local civic affairs. Most lending and other customer-related business decisions can be made without the delays often associated with larger institutions. Additionally, employment of local managers and personnel in various offices and low turnover of personnel enable us to establish and maintain long-term relationships with individual and corporate customers. Also, due to acquisitions of other banks headquartered in North Carolina and South Carolina, we are the only bank headquartered in North Carolina with total assets between $4 billion and $35 billion and the only bank headquartered in either state with total assets between $4 billion and $14 billion. We believe that enhances several of our competitive advantages discussed above, as well as provides scarcity value from an investor viewpoint.

Lending Policy and Procedures
 
Conservative lending policies and procedures and appropriate underwriting standards are high priorities of the Bank. Loans are approved under our written loan policy, which provides that lending officers, principally branch managers, have authority to approve loans of various amounts up to $350,000 with lending limits varying depending upon the experience of the lending officer and whether the loan is secured or unsecured. We have seven senior lending officers who have authority to approve secured loans up to $500,000 and each of our five Regional Presidents has authority to approve secured loans up to $1,000,000. Loans up to $5,000,000 are approved by the Bank’s Regional Credit Officers through our Credit Administration Department. The Bank’s President and Chief Credit Officer have authority to approve loans up to $10,000,000, while the President and the Chief Credit Officer have joint authority to approve loans up to $25,000,000. The Bank’s Board of Directors maintains loan authority in excess of the Bank’s in-house limit, currently $25,000,000, and generally approves loans through its Executive Loan Committee. All lending authorities are based on the borrower’s Total Credit Exposure (“TCE”), which is an aggregate of the Bank’s lending relationship to the borrower. TCE is based on the borrower’s total credit exposure with the Bank either directly or indirectly through loan guarantees or other borrowing entities related to the borrower through control or ownership.
 
The Executive Loan Committee reviews and approves loans that exceed the Bank’s in-house limit, loans to executive officers, directors, and their affiliates and, in certain instances, other types of loans. New credit extensions are reviewed daily by our senior management and the Credit Administration Department.
 
We continually monitor our loan portfolio to identify areas of concern and to enable us to take corrective action. Lending and credit administration officers and the board of directors meet periodically to review past due loans and portfolio quality, while assuring that the Bank is appropriately meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves. Individual lending officers are responsible for monitoring any changes in the financial status of borrowers and pursuing collection of early-stage past due amounts. For certain types of loans that exceed our established parameters of past due status, the Bank’s Asset Resolution Group assumes the management of the loan, and in some cases we engage a third-party firm to assist in collection efforts.
 
The Bank has an internal Loan Review Department that conducts on-going and targeted reviews of the Bank’s loan portfolio and assesses the Bank’s adherence to loan policies, risk grading and accrual policies. Reports are generated for management based on these activities and findings are used to adjust risk grades as deemed appropriate. In addition, these reports are shared with the Bank’s Board of Directors. The Loan Review Department also provides training assistance to the Bank’s Training and Credit Administration departments.
 
To further assess the Bank’s loan portfolio and as a secondary review of the Bank’s Loan Review Department, we also contract with an independent consulting firm to review new loan originations meeting certain criteria, as well as to assign risk grades to existing credits meeting certain thresholds. The consulting firm’s observations, comments, and risk grades, including variances with the Bank’s risk grades, are shared with the audit committee of the Company’s board of directors and are considered by management in setting Bank policy, as well as in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. For additional information, see “Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience” under Item 7 below.
 
Investment Policy and Procedures 
 
We have adopted an investment policy designed to maximize our income from funds not needed to meet loan demand, in a manner consistent with appropriate liquidity and risk objectives. Pursuant to this policy, we may invest in U.S. government and government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities, state and municipal obligations, public housing authority bonds, and, to a limited extent, corporate bonds. We may also invest up to $60 million in time deposits with other financial institutions. Time deposit purchases from any one financial institution exceeding FDIC insurance coverage limits are evaluated as a corporate bond and are subject to the same due diligence requirements as corporate bonds (described below).
 
9

In making investment decisions, we do not solely rely on credit ratings to determine the credit-worthiness of an issuer of securities, but we use credit ratings in conjunction with other information when performing due diligence prior to the purchase of a security. Securities that are not rated investment grade will not be purchased. Securities rated below Moody’s BAA or Standard and Poor’s BBB generally will not be purchased. Securities rated below A are periodically reviewed for credit-worthiness. We may purchase non-rated municipal bonds only if such bonds are in our general market area and we determine these bonds have a credit risk no greater than the minimum ratings referred to above. We are also authorized by our Board of Directors to invest a portion of our securities portfolio in high quality corporate bonds, with the amount of such bonds not to exceed 15% of the entire securities portfolio. Prior to purchasing a corporate bond, the Company’s management performs due diligence on the issuer of the bond, and the purchase is not made unless we believe that the purchase of the bond bears no more risk to the Company than would an unsecured loan to the same company. On a quarterly basis, we review the financial statements for the corporate bond issuers that we own for any signs of deterioration so that we can take timely action if deemed necessary.
 
Our Chief Investment Officer implements the investment policy, monitors the investment portfolio, recommends portfolio strategies and reports to the Company’s Investment Committee. The Investment Committee generally meets on a quarterly basis to review investment activity and to assess the overall position of the securities portfolio. The Investment Committee compares our securities portfolio with portfolios of other companies of comparable size. In addition, reports of all purchases, sales, issuer calls, net profits or losses and market appreciation or depreciation of the securities portfolio are reviewed by our Board of Directors. Once a quarter, our interest rate risk exposure is evaluated by our Board of Directors. Each year, the written investment policy is approved by the board of directors.
 
Mergers and Acquisitions
 
As part of our operations, we have pursued an acquisition strategy over the years to augment our organic growth. We regularly evaluate the potential acquisition of various financial institutions. Our acquisitions have generally fallen into one of three categories: 1) an acquisition of a financial institution or branch thereof within a market in which we operate, 2) an acquisition of a financial institution or branch thereof in a market contiguous or nearly contiguous to a market in which we operate, or 3) an acquisition of a company that has products or services that we do not currently offer. Historically, we have paid for our acquisitions with cash and/or common stock and any operating income or loss has been fully borne by the Company beginning on the closing date of the acquisition.
 
Since becoming a public company in 1987, we have completed numerous acquisitions in each of the three categories described above. We have completed several whole-bank traditional acquisitions in our existing and contiguous markets; we have purchased a number of bank branches from other banks (both in existing market areas and in contiguous/nearly contiguous markets); and we have acquired several insurance agencies, which has provided us with the ability to offer property and casualty insurance coverage.
 
In 2009, FDIC-assisted acquisitions began to occur frequently as banking regulators closed problem banks. In FDIC-assisted transactions, the acquiring bank often does not pay any consideration for the failed bank, and in some cases receives cash from the FDIC as part of the transaction. In addition, the acquiring bank usually enters into one or more loss share agreements with the FDIC, which affords the acquiring bank significant loss protection. In both 2009 and 2011 we acquired the operations of failed banks in FDIC-assisted transactions. See the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K for those years for more information on these acquisitions.
 
The following paragraphs describe the other acquisitions that we have completed in the past three years.
 
In January 2016, we acquired Bankingport, Inc., an insurance agency based in Sanford, North Carolina. Although not material to the Company’s consolidated operations, the acquisition provided us with the opportunity to enhance our product offerings, as well as expand our insurance agency operations into a significant banking market for our Company. Also, this acquisition provides us a larger platform for leveraging insurance services throughout our bank branch network.

In May 2016, we completed the acquisition of SBA Complete. SBA Complete specializes in consulting with financial institutions across the country related to SBA loan origination and servicing. Many community banks do not have the in-house capability to comprehensively originate and service those types of loans, so they contract with SBA Complete for assistance. To learn more about this subsidiary of the Bank, please visit www.sbacomplete.com. Information included on our Internet site is not incorporated by reference into this annual report.
 
Soon after the acquisition of SBA Complete, we leveraged its capabilities by launching our own SBA Lending Division. Through a network of specialized First Bank loan officers, this Division offers SBA loans to small business owners throughout the United States. We typically sell the portion of each loan that is guaranteed by the SBA at a premium and record the non-guaranteed portion to our balance sheet. To learn more about our SBA Lending Division, please visit www.firstbanksba.com. Information included on our Internet site is not incorporated by reference into this annual report.
 
In March 2016, we announced an agreement to exchange our seven Virginia branches, with approximately $151 million in loans and $134 million in deposits, for six North Carolina branches of a community bank with a large Virginia presence that included approximately $152 million in loans and $111 million in deposits. Four of the six branches we assumed were in Winston-Salem, with the other two branches located in the Charlotte-metro markets of Mooresville and Huntersville. The Winston-Salem branches we assumed improved the Triad expansion initiative, while the Mooresville and Huntersville branches increased our Charlotte market expansion. This transaction, which was completed in July 2016, resulted in our exit from western Virginia. The opportunity to assume what is essentially a banking franchise in markets where we had recently invested in human capital was the primary factor we considered in entering into the exchange agreement.
 
In March 2017, we acquired Carolina Bank Holdings, Inc. (“Carolina Bank”), the parent company of Carolina Bank. Carolina Bank was a community bank headquartered in Greensboro with $682 million in assets, with eight branches located in Greensboro, Winston-Salem, Burlington and Asheboro. This acquisition built on the Winston-Salem expansion previously discussed and significantly accelerated our recent expansion initiative in the Greensboro market.
 
In September 2017, we acquired Bear Insurance Services, an insurance agency based in Albemarle, North Carolina. This acquisition provided us a larger platform for leveraging insurance services throughout our bank branch network and more than doubled our insurance agency revenue.
 
In October 2017, we acquired ASB Bancorp, Inc. (“Asheville Savings Bank”), the parent company of Asheville Savings Bank, SSB. Asheville Savings Bank operated in the attractive and high-growth market of Asheville, North Carolina, with $798 million in assets and 13 branches located throughout the Asheville market area.
 
There are many factors that we consider when evaluating how much to offer for potential acquisition candidates, with a few of the more significant factors being projected impact on earnings per share, projected impact on capital, and projected impact on book value and tangible book value. Significant assumptions that affect this analysis include the estimated future earnings stream of the acquisition candidate, estimated credit and other losses to be incurred, the amount of cost efficiencies that can be realized, and the interest rate earned/lost on the cash received/paid. In addition to these primary factors, we also consider other factors including (but not limited to) marketplace acquisition statistics, location of the candidate in relation to our expansion strategy, market growth potential, management of the candidate, potential integration issues (including corporate culture), and the size of the acquisition candidate.
 
We plan to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that could potentially benefit the Company and its shareholders. These opportunities may include acquisitions that do not fit the categories discussed above.
 
11

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,054 full-time and 44 part-time employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Supervision and Regulation
 
As a bank holding company, we are subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve and the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks (the “Commissioner”). The Bank is also subject to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve and the Commissioner. For additional information, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
 
Supervision and Regulation of the Company
 
The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company is also regulated by the Commissioner under the North Carolina banking laws.
 
A bank holding company is required to file quarterly reports and other information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries with the Federal Reserve. It is also subject to examination by the Federal Reserve and is required to obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to making certain acquisitions of other institutions or voting securities. The Federal Reserve requires the Company to maintain certain levels of capital - see “Capital Resources and Shareholders’ Equity” under Item 7 below. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to take enforcement action against any bank holding company that commits any unsafe or unsound practice, or violates certain laws, regulations or conditions imposed in writing by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve generally prohibits a bank holding company from declaring or paying a cash dividend that would impose undue pressure on the capital of subsidiary banks or would be funded only through borrowing or other arrangements which might adversely affect a bank holding company’s financial position. Under the Federal Reserve policy, a bank holding company is not permitted to continue its existing rate of cash dividends on its common stock unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund each dividend and its prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
 
The Commissioner is empowered to regulate certain acquisitions of North Carolina banks and bank holding companies, issue cease and desist orders for violations of North Carolina banking laws, and promulgate rules necessary to effectuate the purposes of those banking laws.
 
Regulatory authorities have cease and desist powers over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries where their actions would constitute a serious threat to the safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary bank. Those authorities may compel holding companies to invest additional capital into banking subsidiaries upon acquisitions or in the event of significant loan losses or rapid growth of loans or deposits.
 
The U.S. Congress and the North Carolina General Assembly have periodically considered and adopted legislation that has impacted the Company.
 
Supervision and Regulation of the Bank
 
Federal banking regulations applicable to all depository financial institutions, among other things: (i) provide federal bank regulatory agencies with powers to prevent unsafe and unsound banking practices; (ii) restrict preferential loans by banks to “insiders” of banks; (iii) require banks to keep information on loans to major shareholders and executive officers; and (iv) bar certain director and officer interlocks between financial institutions.
 
As a state-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to the provisions of the North Carolina banking statutes and to regulation by the Commissioner. The Commissioner has a wide range of regulatory authority over the activities and operations of the Bank, and the Commissioner’s staff conducts periodic examinations of the Bank and its affiliates to ensure compliance with state banking laws and regulations and to assess the safety and soundness of the Bank. Among other things, the Commissioner regulates the merger of state-chartered banks, the payment of dividends, loans to officers and directors, recordkeeping, types and amounts of loans and investments, and the establishment of branches. The Commissioner also has cease and desist powers over state-chartered banks for violations of state banking laws or regulations and for unsafe or unsound conduct that is likely to jeopardize the interest of depositors.

The dividends that may be paid by the Bank to the Company are subject to legal limitations under North Carolina law. In addition, under Federal Reserve regulations, a dividend cannot be paid by the Bank if it would be less than well-capitalized after the dividend. The Federal Reserve may also prevent the payment of a dividend by the Bank if it determines that the payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The ability of the Company to pay dividends to its shareholders is largely dependent on the dividends paid to the Company by the Bank.
 
The Federal Reserve is authorized to approve conversions, mergers, and assumptions of deposit liability transactions between insured banks and uninsured banks or institutions, and to prevent capital or surplus diminution in such transactions if the resulting, continuing, or assumed bank is an insured member bank. First Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System, and accordingly the Federal Reserve also conducts periodic examinations of the Bank to assess its safety and soundness and its compliance with banking laws and regulations, and it has the power to implement changes to, or restrictions on, the Bank’s operations if it finds that a violation is occurring or is threatened. In addition, the Federal Reserve monitors the Bank’s compliance with several banking statutes, such as the Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act and the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977.
 
FDIC Insurance
 
As a member of the FDIC, our deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC, and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. The basic deposit insurance level is generally $250,000, as specified in FDIC regulations. For this protection, each insured bank pays a quarterly statutory assessment and is subject to the rules and regulations of the FDIC.
 
The FDIC insurance premium is based on an institution’s total assets minus its Tier 1 capital. An institution’s premiums are determined based on its capital, supervisory ratings and other factors. Premium rates generally may increase if the FDIC deposit insurance fund is strained due to the cost of bank failures and the number of troubled banks. In addition, if the Bank experiences financial distress or operates in an unsafe or unsound manner, its deposit premiums may increase.
 
We recognized approximately $2.3 million, $2.4 million, and $2.0 million in FDIC insurance expense in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. In November 2018, the FDIC announced that the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) reserve ratio exceeded the statutory minimum of 1.35% as of September 30, 2018. Among other things, this resulted in the FDIC awarding assessment credits for banks with less than $10 billion in total assets that had contributed to the DIF in prior years. We were notified in January 2019 that we had received $1.35 million in credits that could be used to offset deposit insurance assessments in the future. When the DIF reaches 1.38%, the FDIC will begin to apply the Bank’s credits against our quarterly deposit insurance assessments. The DIF was 1.36% at December 31, 2018.
 
The FDIC may conduct examinations of and require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. It may also prohibit an institution from engaging in any activity that it determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the deposit insurance fund and may terminate the Bank’s deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition.
 
Legislative and Regulatory Guidance and Developments
 
In addition to the regulations that are described above, new legislation is introduced from time to time in the U.S. Congress that may affect our operations. In addition, the regulations governing the Company and the Bank may be amended from time to time by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), or other agencies, as appropriate. Any legislative or regulatory changes, or changes to accounting standards, in the future could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
 
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act became law. The Dodd-Frank Act has had and will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes including, among other things,

· | enhanced authority over troubled and failing banks and their holding companies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increased capital and liquidity requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | increased regulatory examination fees; and
--+-------------------------------------------


· | specific provisions designed to improve supervision and safety and soundness by imposing restrictions and limitations on the scope and type of banking and financial activities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While much of the original provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act were not directly applicable to us due to size thresholds, many of the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to implementation over the course of several years. While we do not currently expect the final requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act to have a material adverse impact on the Company, we do expect them to negatively impact our profitability, require changes to certain of our business practices, including limitations on fee income opportunities, and impose more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements upon the Company. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with the new statutory and regulatory requirements.
 
In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Economic Growth Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory changes for banks and their holding companies.
 
The Economic Growth Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and provides for an alternative capital rule for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. The Economic Growth Act instructed the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” of between 8% and 10%, which has been proposed to be 9% by the federal regulators. The Community Bank Leverage Ratio provides for a simpler calculation of a bank’s capital ratio than the Basel III provisions currently in place (see below). Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the Community Bank Leverage Ratio will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered to be “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules. In addition, the Economic Growth Act includes regulatory relief for community banks of certain sizes regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans. We continue to evaluate the impact that the rules issued thus far under the Economic Growth Act will have on the bank, but we currently do not believe that it will be significant. At this time, we do not expect to opt-in to the ability to utilize the Community Bank Leverage Ratio and will instead continue to use the Basel III standards.
 
It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the Economic Growth Act will ultimately be applied to, or what specific impact the Economic Growth Act and the yet-to-be-written implementing rules and regulations will have on us.

Regulatory Capital Requirement under Basel III
 
Effective January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank became subject to new regulatory capital rules agreed to by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the accord referred to as “Basel III.” Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the following were the initial minimum capital ratios applicable to the Company and the Bank as of January 1, 2015:

· | 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;
--+-----------------------------------


· | 6.0% Tier I capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier I capital) to risk-weighted assets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 8.0% total capital (that is, Tier I capital plus Tier II capital) to risk-weighted assets; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 4.0% Tier I leverage ratio (that is Tier I capital) to quarterly average total assets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Common Equity Tier I capital (“CET1”) is comprised of common stock and related surplus, plus retained earnings, and is reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities. Tier I capital is comprised of CET1 capital plus Additional Tier I capital, which for the Company includes non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities. Total capital is comprised of Tier I capital plus certain adjustments, the largest of which for the Company and the Bank is the allowance for loan losses. Risk-weighted assets refer to the on- and off-balance sheet exposures of the Company and the Bank, adjusted for their related risk levels using formulas set forth in Federal Reserve regulations
 
The Basel III Capital Rules include a “capital conservation buffer,” composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and is being phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). Thus, effective as of January 1, 2019, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain this additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, resulting in the following minimum capital ratios:
 

· | 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 6.0% Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier I capital ratio of at least 8.5%;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 8.0% total capital to risk-weighted assets, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of at least 10.5%; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 4.0% Tier I leverage ratio
--+---------------------------

 
In addition to the minimum capital requirements described above, the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action also contains specific capital guidelines for a bank’s classification as “well capitalized.” The current specific guidelines are as follows:
 

· | CET1 Capital Ratio of at least 6.50%;
--+--------------------------------------


· | Tier I Capital Ratio of at least 8.00%;
--+----------------------------------------


· | Total Capital Ratio of at least 10.00%; and a
--+----------------------------------------------


· | Leverage Ratio of at least 5.00%.
--+----------------------------------

 
If a bank falls below “well capitalized” status in any of these three ratios, it must ask for FDIC permission to originate or renew brokered deposits. First Bank is well-capitalized under all capital guidelines.
 
Current Expected Credit Loss Accounting Standard
 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss (or “CECL”), requires FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies (banking organizations) to recognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader range of assets than the current method of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, a banking organization must record a one-time adjustment to its allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of credit loss allowances under the current methodology and the amount required under CECL. For a banking organization, implementation of CECL is generally likely to reduce retained earnings, and to affect other items, in a manner that reduces its regulatory capital. We continue our ongoing analysis on the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
15

The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted a rule that provides a banking organization the option to phase-in over a three-year period the effects of CECL on its regulatory capital upon the adoption of the standard.
 
Liquidity Requirements
 
Historically, the regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without required formulaic measures. Liquidity risk management has become increasingly important since the financial crisis. The Basel III liquidity framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward would be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”), is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements will incent banking entities to increase their holdings of Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source.
 
In September 2014, the federal bank regulators approved final rules implementing the LCR for advanced approaches banking organizations (i.e., banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure) and a modified version of the LCR for bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets that are not advanced approach banking organizations, neither of which would apply to the Company or the Bank. The federal bank regulators have not yet proposed rules to implement the NSFR or addressed the scope of bank organizations to which it will apply.
 
Following the enactment of the Economic Growth Act in May 2018, the Federal Reserve stated that it would no longer require bank holding companies with less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets to comply with the modified version of the LCR. In addition, in October 2018, the federal bank regulators proposed to revise their liquidity requirements so that banking organizations that are not global systematically important banks and have less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $75 billion in each of off-balance sheet exposure, nonbank assets, cross-jurisdictional activity and short-term wholesale funding would not be subject to any LCR or NSFR requirements.
 
Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity
 
The federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services.

In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing Internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. The Company has multiple Information Security Programs that reflect the requirements of this guidance. If, however, we fail to observe the regulatory guidance in the future, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.
 
In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. We employ an in-depth, layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyber-attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. While to date we have not detected a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity.
 
Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act
 
A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “USA Patriot Act”) substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations on financial institutions, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States.
 
On May 11, 2016, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued new anti-money laundering (“AML”) rules governing corporate entities doing business with banks and other financial institutions that are subject to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act. The AML rules impose significant due diligence obligations on financial institutions with respect to opening of new accounts and the monitoring of existing accounts. Under the AML rules, a financial institution must identify persons owning or controlling 25% or more of a “legal entity,” whenever the legal entity opens a new account at the bank. The financial institution must also identify an individual who has substantial management authority at the legal entity, such as a CEO, CFO, or managing partner. These new AML rules became effective in May 2018.
 
The AML rules codify within the FinCEN regulations the “pillars” that must be included in a financial institutions AML compliance program. Regulators previously communicated their expectations with respect to four of these pillars: (1) the development of internal policies, procedures, and control; (2) the designation of a compliance officer; (3) the establishment of an ongoing employee training program; and (4) the implementation of an independent audit function to test programs. The new beneficial ownership requirement establishes a fifth pillar. Among other things, this new pillar includes the necessity to monitor and update the beneficial ownership of a legal entity, including the need to subject corporate borrowers to due diligence requests from financial institutions for certifications with respect to their beneficial owners. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 
 
The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others which are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.
Community Reinvestment Act
 
The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”) requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low- and moderate- income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings. In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination under the CRA. Furthermore, banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering a request for an approval of a proposed transaction. First Bank received a rating of “satisfactory” in its most recent CRA examination. In April 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury issued a memorandum to the federal banking regulators with recommended changes to the CRA’s implementing regulations to reduce their complexity and associated burden on banks. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the CRA.
Federal Securities Laws
 
The common stock of the Company is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Therefore, the Company is subject to the reporting, information disclosure, proxy solicitation, insider trading limits and other requirements imposed on public companies by the SEC under the Exchange Act. This includes limits on sales of stock by certain insiders and the filing of insider ownership reports with the SEC. The SEC and Nasdaq have adopted regulations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd Frank Act that apply to the Company as a Nasdaq-traded, public company, which seek to improve corporate governance, provide enhanced penalties for financial reporting improprieties and improve the reliability of disclosures in SEC filings.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
 
U.S. tax reform legislation was signed into law on December 22, 2017 and made broad and complex changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including reducing the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018. With the adoption of this tax reform, our deferred tax balances were reduced as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the new 21% statutory tax rate.
 
Beginning January 1, 2018, we applied the federal tax rate of 21% to our taxable earnings. Other provisions of U.S. tax reform that we adopted on January 1, 2018, include, but are not limited to: 1) provisions reducing the dividends received deduction; 2) essentially eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; 3) retaining an element of current inclusion of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; 4) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax ("AMT") and 5) changing how existing AMT credits will be realized.
