Overview
 We design and cause to be designed advanced zero-emission electric and hybrid drivetrain systems for integration in new school buses and medium to heavy-duty commercial fleet vehicles. We also design and cause to be designed re-power conversion kits to replace conventional drivetrain systems for combustion powered vehicles with zero-emission electric or hybrid drivetrain systems.  We expect to expand our product offerings to include the sale of zero-emission systems in vehicles manufactured by outside, original equipment manufacture (“OEM”) partners located in China, Malaysia and the Philippines, that can be marketed, sold, warrantied and serviced through our developing distribution and service network.
Our drivetrain systems can include options for telemetrics for remote monitoring, electric power-export and various levels of grid-connectivity. Our zero-emission systems may also grow to include automated charging infrastructure and “intelligent” stationary energy storage that enables fast vehicle charging, emergency back-up facility power, and access to the developing, grid-connected opportunities for the aggregate power available from groups of large battery packs.
 In addition to providing the zero-emission electric and hybrid drivetrain systems and re-power conversion kits mentioned above, we are also a provider of new zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles focused on total cost of ownership. Our drivetrain systems and vehicles are designed to help fleet operators unlock the benefits of green technology and address the challenges of local, state and federal regulatory compliance and traditional-fuel price cost instability, in addition to the health benefits that are a benefit of this technology.
 We generated minimal revenue from inception through June 30, 2018. For 
the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated $5.0 million, most of which we generated in the second half of 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our net losses were $11.0 million and $21.9 million, respectively. 
 Market Overview
 Concerns regarding climate change and other environmental considerations have led to the implementation of laws and regulations t
hat restrict, cap, or tax emissions in the automotive industry and throughout other industries. In particular, Environmental Protection Agency (“
EPA”
) Tier 4 emission standards, California Air Resources Board (“
CARB”) regulations, and recently implemented policies in Europe, generally referred to as Stage I, II, III and IV regulations, require a significant reduction in the level of emissions and particulate matter produced by diesel power systems and are increasing the costs associated with producing carbon-intensive fuels. On June 28, 2018, China officially released the China VI emission standard for new heavy-duty vehicles, which is equivalent to, or in some aspects even more stringent than, the Euro VI emission standard. The China VI standard intends to force diesel particulate filters on all new diesel heavy-duty vehicles introduced to the market after July 2021. If effectively implemented, it will transition all new heavy-duty vehicles in China to soot-free emission levels. 
 These regulations are expected to increase both the cost and size of emission-compliant diesel power products, primarily due to the need to incorporate additional combustion and after-treatment components. A variety of market factors are contributing to the increased use of alternative fuels and growth of alternative fuel technology, including economics, energy independence, environmental concerns, and the widespread availability of alternative fuels. As the price of crude oil remains volatile and the threats of climate change and air pollution increase as public concerns, we believe the search for more cost effective and cleaner fuels has become more important. Electricity has emerged as a cleaner-fuel solution to these challenges. The price of alternative fuels such as electricity is often substantially less than diesel or gasoline, and alternative fuels can result in the production of lower amounts of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants. In addition, several public utilities in California and elsewhere have applied to their states’ public utilities commissions (“PUCs”) for rate increases to be used for the purchase or leasing of electric vehicles and infrastructure. Additional requests have been made by the utilities to offer favorable costs for electric bus charging. In fact, three states (California, New York and New Jersey) are expected to spend $1.3 billion to build more electric vehicle charging.

According to the International Energy Agency (“IEA”), the world’s fleet of electric vehicles grew 54% to about 3.1 million in 2017, and the IEA forecasts electric vehicles will grow from 3 million to 125 million by 2030, with government policy being the linchpin for electric vehicle adoption.
 Based on the IEA’s view, we believe that existing policies 
will make China and Europe the biggest adopters. In China, we anticipate that 
credits and subsidies will help electric vehicles 
grow to account for more than a quarter of the car market by 2030. Meanwhile, we believe that tightening emissions standards and
 high fuel taxes in Europe will result in substantial increases in 
the market share of 
electric vehicles. However, despite increasing 
market penetration in places like California and other states that have adopted 
zero emission 
plans, reduced taxes on fuel
s and the Trump administration’s stated 
intentions to scale back vehicle emissions standards could suppress 
growth. Notwithstanding, new 
electric car sales in China grew 
by 72%
, or 580,000 units, in 2017, which increased 
total ownership to over 1 million v
ehicles. Further, according to the IEA, China 
is also driving growth in electric buses and two-wheeled vehicles, and accounts 
for about 99% 
of the world’s stock of the fast-growing categories.
 In the United States
, through June 2018, over 123,000 new electric vehicles 
were registered in the United States
, compared to 91,000 in the first half of 2017, an increase of 35% and more than double the sales from just 3 years ago.
 The overall market for electric vehicles consists of multiple, discrete markets for various vehicle types, including passenger cars, buses, two-wheelers and others. Passenger cars are the most prominent, but two-wheelers are far more prevalent, particularly in Asia, and buses and trucks, although smaller in number, are significantly higher in price and often purchased in bulk by major corporate customers or government or transit agencies. Because light duty passenger vehicles represent the largest potential market and have received the most attention from both analysts and policymakers, most
 global forecasts look at light duty electric vehicle sales.
 Charging infrastructure is another important factor in electric vehicle 
adoption rates. According to an October 2018 United States 
Department of Energy (“DOE”) 
article, there are 19,975 Level 2 charging stations and 2,368 DC Fast Charging stations to serve electric vehicles in the United States
. They define a “station” as a non-residential address where Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (“
EVSE”
) is located, inclu
ding both public and private stations, some of which may include 
several charging outlets per station. Over 60% of those charging stations are maintained by four networks: ChargePoint, Tesla, Blink, and SemaCharge. Level 2 charging stations can be used res
identially or commercially to provide electricity faster than a standard 120-volt outlet. ChargePoint has the largest number of non-residential Level 2 charging stations, 
followed by Tesla. DC Fast Charging stations allow for long distance travel of electric vehicles 
by providing quick recharge rates along highways and well-traveled corridors between metropolitan areas. The eVgo Network has the largest number of DC Fast Charging stations, followed by Tesla with its SuperCharger network. Some geographic area
s have considerably more charging stations than others, contributing to greater electric vehicle usage in those regions.
 Commercial Vehicles
 As relatively simple as the pricing analysis is for individual consumers, the purchase and deployment of heavy duty
 commercial vehicles involves consideration of many more variables. Here, the type of customer is a major determinant, whether it is a commercial customer buying trucks for a fleet, a school district, or a municipal entity purchasing buses for public use. 
Navigant Research forecasts global sales of electric drive and electric-assisted medium and heavy duty commercial vehicles (over 10,000 gross vehicle weight rating (“
GVWR”)) to grow from 16,000 in 2014 to almost 160,000 in 2023, for total sales of over 800
,000 of such vehicles during the period. Navigant Research expects the electric vehicle market share to increase from 0.4% to 2.9% of all medium and heavy duty commercial vehicle sales over the same period.
 Environmental Benefits
 Because heavy-duty commerc
ial vehicles consume considerably more fuel than light duty passenger vehicles, the environmental benefits of replacing conventionally fueled commercial vehicles with electric vehicles
can also be substantial. Whereas an electric passenger car may reduce g
reenhouse gas (“
GHG”) emissions by 3 tons per year as compared to a conventional car, replacing a conventional Class 8 port drayage truck with an electric equivalent can bring an 18 metric ton annual reduction in GHG emissions. Replacing a conventional diesel bus with an all-electric bus can achieve a 78 metric ton (approximately 171,961 pounds) reduction in GHG emissions. Electric buses can also reduce nitrous oxide emissions by 47 kg (approximately 104 pounds) per year compared to a diesel bus and 19 kg (
approximately 42 pounds) compared to a clean natural gas (“
CNG”
) bus. As discussed below, we believe these pollution reductions have had the greatest impact in the electric bus market, where municipalities are the principal purchasers. 
3

Electricity Cost Considerations
 Despite the higher electricity consumption of electric trucks, more widespread adoption could lead to more efficient utilization of utility and power generation assets and thus not necessarily lead to higher rates. At this point, deployment of electric trucks and buses is still too small to assess their full impact on electricity prices. As a study by the clean transportation nonprofit CALSTART emphasizes, evaluating this impact will involve weighing potential efficiency benefits, the impact on utility distribution grids, including the cost of potential upgrades, and the need for additional infrastructure. In this regard, several public utilities have applied to their state’s PUCs for rate increases to be used for the purchase or leasing of electric vehicles and infrastructure. Additional requests have been made by the utilities to offer favorable costs for electric school bus charging.  
Trucks
 Some of the main markets for electric trucks include delivery vans, shuttle buses, and utility or work trucks, each of which has its own set of challenges. Where PHEVs have greater operational flexibility, and require less charging infrastructure, BEVs can be either short range, which can charge quickly and operate with limited interruption, or long range, requiring longer charging times but more intraday operational flexibility. The table below presents a few of the examples of different kinds of vehicles, battery sizes, and electricity demands.
Table 1: Electricity Needs of Electric Truck and Bus Types
 
 
Technology Type | Example | Average Peak Demand | Battery Size 
-----------------+---------------------------------------------+---------------------+--------------
Short Range PHEV | Volvo PHEV Class 8 Drayage Truck | 10 kW | 10kWh 
Work Truck PHEV | Odyne Advanced Diesel PHEV Truck | 3.3 kW | 14/28 kWh 
Long Range PHEV | Efficient Drivetrain PHEV/CNG Class 4 Truck | Up to 6.6 kW | 40 kWh 
Short Range BEV | Proterra Fast Charge Catalyst | 280 to 380 kW* | 53 or 131 kWh
Medium Range BEV | Transpower Electric Drayage Drive | 70 kW | 215 kWh 
Long Range BEV | BYD 40-foot Electric Transit Bus | 80 kW or 200 kW | 324 kWh 


* | For deployments of 4 to 8 buses per fast charger
--+-------------------------------------------------

 Because of charging needs and restrictions, we believe short-haul fleet vehicles that operate in a limited geographic area and return to central locations, such as delivery vans and shuttle buses, are the best candidates for electrification.
 Transit Buses
 For a number of reasons, we believe buses present a more promising near-term market for electrification than other commercial vehicles. First, most bus purchases are public in nature
, coming from transit agencies or school districts, many of which require public transportation operators to purchase and operate low-emissions vehicles. For public entities, cleaner transportation systems can provide benefits beyond reduced operating costs, in the form of less pollution and lower abatement and cleanup costs. Second, electric buses are likely to have lower fuel and maintenance costs, typically a large cost area for transit operators, compared to conventional diesel buses. Third, we believe electric buses have smoother, faster acceleration and provide a quieter, smoother ride, benefiting both passengers and the surrounding urban environment.
 Similar to commercial fleets, high initial costs and the logistics of charging remain the greatest drawbacks. Depending on the market, hybrid buses can cost at least 40% more than, and sometimes over twice as much as, conventional diesel or CNG buses. Electric buses can be anywhere from two to nearly five times as expensive as conventional buses.
 4

Hybrid buses have gained greater traction than pure electric models in China and India, the two largest markets for electric buses. Both countries have some of the world’s worst urban pollution, as well as cities where buses form a greater part of public transportation than rail systems. Both China and India have a number of domestic hybrid and electric bus manufacturers, including Yutong, Xiamen King Long Motor Group, BYD, Nanjing Golden Dragon Bus, and Zhongtong Bus in China and Tata and Ashok Leyland in India. Of the 500,000 city buses in operation in China in 2014, analysts estimate that 80,000 were electric (presumably including hybrid electric models), with 27,000 more sold in 2014 and about 20,000 sold through the first half of 2015. The five companies mentioned above accounted for 62.5%, or 17,011, of the buses sold in 2014.
 Electric or hybrid electric buses made up 17% of bus fleets in the United States in 2014, with most being gasoline or diesel hybrids, which made up between 30% and 40% of new bus sales. At the end of 2016, there were over 300 zero-emissions buses, that is, fully electric or fuel cell-powered buses, operating in transit fleets throughout the nation. A CALSTART executive has estimated that that zero-emissions models will make up 20% of the tr
ansit bus market by 2030. As an example of the cost impact of purchasing new electric buses, the Chicago Transit Authority recently awarded a $32 million contract for the 
purchase of 
20 new electric buses.
 School Buses
 School buses present another significant potential market for electrification. The United States has 480,000 school buses carrying 25 million children to school every day. The typically short, predictable routes of school buses are particularly suited to running solely on electricity. Traditional diesel school buses, which make up over half the total fleet, not only consume large amounts of fuel-more than 800 million gallons of diesel a year in the United States, at a fuel economy of only 4–5 mpg-but also directly impact children with tailpipe emissions. In response, a number of states have included school buses in clean transportation mandates, and some school districts, notably in California and Illinois, have begun to replace diesel buses with electric. Incentive programs to help fund the pu
rchase of electric school buses in the United States are significant. 
 Market Drivers
 A number of factors, including the general world-wide desire to improve the health of people, impact both the supply and demand for various types of electric vehicles and we believe that we are well positioned to benefit as a result of these driving forces. Except for energy storage technologies, discussed earlier, subsequent sections will address these market drivers in greater detail.
 We believe prominent drivers of supply include:
  
• | The declining cost and higher availability of energy storage technologies, specifically the cost and capacity of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grants, loans, tax breaks, and other financial support available for energy storage and electric vehicle research and development;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Requirements that a specific percentage of automakers’ models be electric or other zero-emission vehicles; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fuel economy standards that require automakers to meet certain fleet-wide miles per gallon benchmarks that effectively require them to sell electric zero-emission vehicles.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe prominent drivers of demand include:
  
• | Mandates that government fleets purchase certain percentages of low emission, energy efficient, or other alternative fuel vehicles;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mandates for transport agencies, ports or school districts to purchase or convert to electric or other alternative fuel vehicles;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rebates, tax credits, and other incentives for purchasing or leasing electric or other alternative fuel vehicles;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5

 
• | The availability of charging stations and other charging infrastructure, driven in turn by government funding, tax credits, rebates, and other incentives and regulatory initiatives aimed at increasing the number of charging stations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The cost of electricity to recharge plug-in electric vehicles, impacted by special rates introduced by utilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preferential treatment in registration, emissions testing, and access to highways, city centers, and HOV lanes; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The cost of traditional petroleum-based fuels compared to the resultant incremental costs of owning and operating an electric vehicle.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 United States—Federal Laws and Incentives
 As numerous as U.S. policies at the state and federal levels may at first appear, unlike in China and many European nations, few federal and state
 policies directly single out electric vehicles. More broadly, federal U.S. policies encourage greater use of vehicles that run on some kind of alternative fuel, whether electricity, natural gas, hydrogen, biodiesel or ethanol. In addition, the U.S. federa
l government has less of a comprehensive, coherent framework aimed at increasing electric vehicle use than do countries like China and many European nations.
 United States—State Laws and Incentives
 Among U.S. states, California is notable for pioneering a number of measures that have encouraged electric vehicle production and adoption, often later copied by other jurisdictions. These include financial incentives like tax credits and rebates for both individual and fleet owners, HOV lane access, and various grant and loan programs. Besides setting the nation’s most stringent tailpipe emissions standards, California has required automakers to produce increasing percentages of zero-emission vehicles, of 
which electric vehicles 
make up a significant portion, along with creating a market that allows manufacturers to buy and sell credits awarded for selling electric vehicles. California has also authorized funding for the purchase of new school buses or retr
ofit of existing buses to accomplish the primary goal of reducing children’s exposure to both cancer-causing and smog-forming pollutants. The purchase of new buses is also 
permitted for fleet expansion as well. See “—Governmental Programs and Incentives” for an additional discussion of certain relevant incentive programs.
 Fleet Operator Challenges
 Fleet operators and their companies face a number of challenges in the market today, including:
  
• | Difficulty complying with existing and new federal and state emission restrictions and compliance requirements. Federal regulatory agencies, such as the EPA, and state regulatory agencies, such as CARB, have set forth mandates designed to reduce emissions from mobile sources. According to CARB, 12 other states and the District of Columbia have adopted California’s greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Finding cost savings while managing high fuel, maintenance and repair costs. The federal Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act of 2007 set strict air quality standards for particulate matter, nitrous oxide and GHG reductions from new manufactured vehicles which were further tightened in 2010 to further reduce the amounts of particulate matter, nitrous oxide and GHG emitted by newly manufactured vehicles.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extending the lives of existing vehicles. Due to reductions in capital expenditure budgets and the legislatively mandated addition of expensive and limiting emission reduction equipment, it is challenging to prolong the lives of existing vehicles because of the increased cost of expensive maintenance, service and repairs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Difficulty planning for the operation of their fleet when fuel supplies are interrupted, such as during a natural disaster. Existing vehicles rely on fuel that must be pumped (using electricity), which may be a challenge to source when supply is interrupted during natural or man-made disasters. It may be possible for emergency service organizations to use the large battery packs of electric drive, commercial fleet vehicles as a mobile source of stored electrical energy. This electrical energy could supplement traditionally fueled back-up generators.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Difficulty in improving the environment around these heavy-duty commercial fleets. Many studies have shown that the air quality in and around vehicles fueled by fossil fuels poses a health risk not only to drivers of these vehicles but to their passengers and those in and around these vehicles. Especially at risk are children as passengers on older diesel fueled buses, as their lungs, brains and other organs have not fully developed and the air quality surrounding a typical school bus using diesel fuel can pose serious health risks. By using zero-emission buses, trucks and cars, we believe we are creating a healthier environment in and around the vehicles they operate for their employees, customers and the communities they serve. In January 2017 (updated in June 2018), the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, on behalf of the California Environmental Protection Agency, released Version 3.0 of the California Communities Environmental Health Screening Tool (“CalEnviroScreen”). CalEnviroScreen identifies California communities by census tract that are disproportionately burdened by, and vulnerable to, multiple sources of pollution.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Solution
 We design and cause to be designed, advanced zero-emission electric and hybrid drivetrain systems for integration into new school buses and medium to heavy-duty commercial fleet vehicles. Variants of these systems, sold in our  re-power conversion kits, can be used to re-power traditionally fueled, existing fleet vehicles for zero-emission, all-electric operation. We also intend to market, sell and support zero-emission vehicles built by others. The drivetrain systems and vehicles we offer are designed to help fleets run more efficiently and cost effectively.  Under our supervision, we subcontract the manufacture of most of our drivetrain systems to integrator partners with excess capacity and appropriate facilities. At this time, we do not manufacture complete vehicles. We sell our zero-emission drivetrain systems to third party OEMs with whom we partner and they manufacture the complete vehicle after installing the drivetrain systems with our initial supervision and support. As of December 31, 2018, we have 
shipped 22 drivetrain systems.  At December 31, 
2018, we have 34 drivetrain systems in production for scheduled delivery in 2019.
 We seek to enable our customers to:
  
• | Add Emission-Compliant Vehicles and Drivetrain Systems to Their Fleets. Our commercial fleet vehicles and drivetrain systems are designed to reduce or eliminate the use of traditional petroleum-based fuels that create greenhouse gases and particulate matter.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduce Total Cost of Ownership. Our technology is designed to reduce fuel budgets by eliminating or reducing the reliance on traditional petroleum-based fuels, instead using the more energy efficient and less variably priced grid-provided electricity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prolong Lives of Existing Vehicles. Zero-emission electric vehicles generally have lower maintenance costs. These reduced maintenance costs may take the form of longer service intervals between brake system maintenance, elimination of internal combustion engine oil and oil filter changes, reduction or elimination of transmission oil and oil filter changes, reduction or elimination of air filter changes, elimination of emissions systems services, elimination of diesel emission fluid use, elimination of emissions tests on traditional fuel vehicles (if converted to a zero-emission electric drivetrain system) and the elimination of certification tests of high pressure tanks on propane, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas powered vehicles (if converted to a zero-emission electric drivetrain system).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Plan for Natural Disasters When Fuel Supply May be Interrupted. Our zero-emissions systems are designed, when optionally equipped, to serve as on-site emergency back-up energy storage if grid power becomes intermittent or fails temporarily during natural or man-made disasters.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improve the Environment Around Vehicles. As a result of our zero-emission systems, drivers, operators, customers and the communities they serve could have healthier environments in and around these vehicles.

Development of the Business to Date
 We have taken an active role in building awareness and support for our zero-emission electric and hybrid drivetrain systems in industry specific target groups and at all levels of government and regulatory agencies and the constituencies they serve. We have accomplished this through
 our participation with Blue Bird Corporation (“Blue Bird”) in its DOE grant program to accelerate the adoption of advanced and alternative fuel vehicles. We have also maintained prior and current memberships in industry groups (private and governmental) a
nd participate in their events; speaking engagements; management interviews; pilot product exhibits; fleet vehicle demonstrations and responses to requests for information and requests for proposals. We regularly engage with electric utility companies acro
ss the United States 
to build awareness of the medium to heavy-duty electric vehicles we currently offer and how their greater adoption could positively increase their customers’ electricity 
usage.
 As discussed below under the section entitled “—Partnershi
ps/Teaming Agreements”, we have entered into a number of agreements with third parties and continue to explore additional alliances, and 
to establish our decentralized assembly, sales and service model. We believe we can preserve cash resources while scaling up quickly when demand requires by leveraging the unused or underutilized service technician time, specific vehicle type expertise and service facility equipment of specific partners in ways to off-load some defined tasks, providing seasonal demand adjustments to technician headcount that will partially mitigate the human resource costs and challenges associated with scaling-up or down an employee base.
 Our Strengths
 We believe the following attributes and capabilities provide us with long-term competitive advantages:
  
• | Product Diversity. We have multiple product offerings, including zero-emission electric and hybrid drivetrain systems for new vehicles or to re-power existing commercial fleet vehicles, new purpose-built zero-emission electric vehicles and, as a result, the ability to scale-up, scale-down or refine a specific product line in response to market demands and the evolving local, state and federal regulatory and incentive programs. Also, within each product area, we have multiple suppliers of key drivetrain system components, allowing price flexibility both for our final products and replacement parts required over the product lifespan. This allows us to meet the expectations and budget constraints of public or private commercial fleet operators.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regulatory Agency Familiarity. By taking an active role in many trade industry groups and related events, we have developed and continually strive to maintain strong relationships with key local, state and federal regulatory agencies involved in the growing zero-emission and hybrid vehicle industry. To meet their own aggressive emissions targets, these regulatory agencies have encouraged the growth of zero-emission electric vehicles and hybrid drivetrain systems, especially in connection with heavy-duty commercial fleets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Relationships With Purchasers. To help shorten the sales cycles for our products, we have identified and built relationships with key commercial operators that have purchasing authority or influence over their organizations. We are also able to leverage past sales and marketing relationships that were built by our experienced management team.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Additional Sales Potential. We have additional sales potential with commercial fleet customers. These potential additional sales could include: automated charging infrastructure, intelligent stationary energy storage systems that enable higher levels of vehicle fast-charging, emergency back-up facility power for use during grid power outages, enabling technologies to access the developing grid-connected opportunities for the aggregate power available from groups of large battery packs, or enabling technologies that allow for the avoidance of electric utility demand charges.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Unique Market Knowledge. We have specific and tailored sales cycle knowledge based on the over 30 years of experience of our management team.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8

Our Strategy
 We intend to capitalize on these opportunities by pursuing the following key strategies:
  
• | Develop Sales Staff. We currently employ an experienced sales staff with ties to trucking fleet, county and city transportation managers, as well as school districts and an extensive dealer network. In 2019, we plan to hire additional sales staff to augment our current personnel. We expect to be able to train these new additions in the electric vehicle differences, benefits, and opportunities for fleet expansion to help our current and future customer base.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build Dealership Networks. We intend to build dealership networks for the local sales and service of our zero-emission new purpose-built zero-emission electric and hybrid commercial vehicles either manufactured by or for us, and to service any vehicles that we have converted to all-electric operation. School Bus Sales of California is a wholly owned subsidiary of ADOMANI, and is a licensed vehicle dealer in California. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop Third Party Relationships. We plan to complete existing negotiations with partners and seek additional partners for the manufacture of our zero-emission systems.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide Demonstrations. We will seek out and respond to local, state and federal pilot demonstration opportunities in interest areas for which we have relevant current product offerings or in areas of interest that are congruent with product(s) that are on our product development roadmap but still in early stage development. We have participated in multiple ride-and-drive events across the United States and Canada in collaboration with Blue Bird and its dealers. In 2019, we intend to build on these school bus ride-and-drive events by demonstrating our new product offerings, which consist of logistic vans, and Class 3, 4, and 5 trucks and chassis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Obtain Approvals From Incentive Programs. We will seek to have our products approved for various local, state and federal vehicle designations and incentive programs, like the California Heavy Duty Voucher Incentive Project administered by CARB, meant to accelerate the purchase of cleaner, more efficient trucks and buses in California. The drivetrain systems we have provided to Blue Bird are approved for voucher programs in California and New York. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow Our Manufacturing, Installation and Service Capability. As facility space and technician time requirements at partners are exceeded, we intend to expand or relocate to larger owned or leased facilities dedicated to the manufacture, installation and service of our zero-emission systems and vehicles.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technical Support. In addition to the technical support we currently provide to Blue Bird and its dealership network, we have assisted in the creation of operator and service manuals, in-field training material, the handling of service inquiries and on-site maintenance technician training. With the introduction of our new, purpose-built electric vehicles, we anticipate adding additional technicians in 2019 to expand our resources for supporting the maintenance, warranty work or repairs that any vehicle we have sold or that contains our drivetrain system may require. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Introduce New Products. As new markets develop, we plan to expand our zero-emission systems into ancillary product verticals, such as charging infrastructure (also called Electric Vehicle Service Equipment), stationary energy storage, vehicle-to-grid hardware and capabilities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop Our International Business. We plan to develop our business internationally. For example, we intend to pursue future opportunities in China, which we believe is an important market for us due in part to its publicly announced emphasis on hybrid and all-electric vehicles and large population. However, we remain in the early stages of the development of our business plan to pursue such opportunities. We continue to assess the logistics and costs associated with the production and sale of our zero-emission drivetrain systems and vehicles in China and in other countries around the world.

Testing
 Our suppliers are vetted before their products are accepted for use in our products. Our drivetrain systems and finished products are inspected, road-tested (when applicable) and receive quality control testing prior to delivery.
Customer Service, Support and Training
 The sales team, both direct and contractors, will be used as the first point of customer contact for customer support and training. At the point that the sales force can no longer handle the volume of these requirements, we will hire, train and support an additional internal staff.
Technology
 Zero-emission electric drivetrain systems for purpose-built new vehicles generally i
nclude the following: electric traction motor/generator of sufficient kW power for grade, speed, acceleration and efficiency requirements, a motor controller/inverter system that modulates electrical power flow between the battery packs and traction motor, a gear reduction system or multispeed transmission, systems to electrify power steering/brakes, a VCU, high-voltage traction battery packs with integrated BMS, battery disconnect units, thermal management systems, vehicle charging hardware, electric HVAC systems, DC to DC inverter(s) to reduce traction battery pack voltage sufficient to operate on-board, low voltage systems, wiring harnesses, user/driver interface and remote diagnostic/tracking/fault code/data logging systems. Although clear industry power-export standards have not yet been adopted, systems and options for a variety of vehicle-to-other power management options (such as grid, building, stationary energy storage, etc.) are being developed by multiple vendors and their inclusion may be offered as additional cost options in the future.
 Re-power drivetrain systems to convert existing traditionally-fueled fleet vehicles with ICEs to zero-emission operation include many of the same components as described above for purpose-built vehicle systems. Fo
r simplicity, cost savings 
and maintenance technician familiarity, some OEM systems of the subject vehicle may be retained and
/or 
utilized, including cooling systems for the engine and transmission, mounting brackets and bolts, power steering and brake systems and 12 and/or 24 volt systems and accessories. Items that are typically not retained/repurposed include the OEM internal combustion engine, transmission, liquid or gaseous fuel tanks and exhaust/treatment systems.
 Sales and Marketing
 Sales
 We intend to expand our marketing and sales force as we open our sales, service and assembly facilities. We expect that each facility will have a team of dedicated marketing and sales employees with responsibility for the geographic region in which the facility is located. As a result, we believe we can efficiently and cost-effectively build out our marketing and sales network.
Marketing
 We plan to focus our marketing efforts on increasing brand awareness, generating demand for our products, communicating product advantages and generating qualified leads for our sales force. We intend to rely on a variety of marketing vehicles, including our website and social media, participation in industry conferences and trade shows, public relations and our collaborative relationships with our business and teaming partners to share our technical message and the benefits of our product offering, with customers.

Manufacturing
 We currently contract with third-party suppliers to manufacture our products. In 2019, we plan on increasing our integration and in-house building of sub-assembly components.
 Distribution
 We intend to distribute our products both inside and outside of our current U.S. market.
 Partnerships/Teaming Agreements
 We have agreements with Amperics, Inc., Blue Bird, Ebus, Inc., Efficient Drivetrains Inc., Envirotech Drive Systems Incorporated and GerWeiss EV USA LLC. None of these agreements contain any binding purchase or sales minimums. 
Amperics, Inc.
 Amperics, Inc., is an 
energy storage technology innovator, developer and vendor of advanced supercapacitor-based intelligent energy storage solutions. In September 2018, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Amperics and made a strategic investment in the company. We initially intend to design and manufacture an uninterruptable power supply product to support a new customer in the Far East. The investment is intended to support product development and manufacture of Amperics product verticals. Since the highest cost components within an electric vehicle drivetrain system or stationary energy storage system are typically the battery packs, we are constantly surveying energy storage options, battery cell chemistry advances and battery vendor offerings to determine how best to balance key attributes such as kilowatt per hour cost, charge/discharge rates, energy density, stability under environmental extremes and degradation over anticipated charge cycles.  A beneficial attribute in one area often comes with a correspond
ing penalty in another.  Supercapacitors, 
in general, are often associated with high power density, very high cycle-life, but lower energy density than traditional lithium-ion or FLA batteries.  We believe that the Amperics supercapacitor technology can alter these attributes, exhibiting a unique combination of both high power density and high energy density.
 Blue Bird Corporation
 Blue Bird offers a complete line of Type A, C and D school buses in a variety of options and configurations. In October 2017, we
 entered into a three-year agreement with Blue Bird pursuant to which we will provide it
, on an exclusive basis, with zero-emission electric drivetrain systems for use in its Type C and D school bus product lines. The agreement sets forth the applicable pr
icing for the products to be purchased thereunder, but does not include any binding minimum purchase obligations on behalf of Blue Bird. During the term of the agreement, Blue Bird must purchase all zero-emission electric drivetrain systems to be used in its Type C and Type D school bus product lines from us, and we have agreed that we will not sell any zero-emission electric drivetrain systems to any similar manufacturer of school and activity buses, or to suppliers or subcontractors who would resell such products to such bus manufacturers. The agreement, however, does not prevent us from selling zero-emission electric drivetrain systems for any other application. The agreement provides that we will indemnify Blue Bird against certain losses resulting from our breach of the agreement and certain other losses. Blue Bird may terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon certain events or without cause upon thirty days prior written notice to us. In November 2017 at the National Association for Pupil Transportation industry event, Blue Bird unveiled the Type C school bus in which our zero emission electric drivetrain system was installed. We subsequently installed our zero-emission drivetrain system in a Type D school bus, and in conjunction with A-Z Bus Sales and a number of other Blue Bird dealers, we also organized and participated in extensive ride-and-drive events for Blue Bird during 2018. These events showcase the Type D all-electric zero-emission school bus to school districts, community leaders and government officials. Blue Bird delivered its first seven all-electric zero-emission school buses “Powered by ADOMANI®” to school districts in September 2018.

EDI”), a subsidiary of Cummins, Inc
. (“Cummins”) 
since being acquired in August 2018, develops and markets a range of state-of-the-art PHEV and electric vehicle drivetrain system solutions worldwide. EDI’s leading-edge hybrid-electric and electric drivetrain systems and technologies enable 
OEMs to meet zero-emissions requirements while providing cost and efficiency advantages across nearly all platform classes and configurations. In October 2017, we entered into a three-year agreement with EDI pursuant to which EDI builds 
for us, on an exclu
sive basis, zero-emission electric drivetrain systems for sale to Blue Bird for installation in its Type C and D school bus product lines. The agreement sets forth the applicable pricing for the products to be purchased thereunder, but does not include any
 binding minimum purchase obligations on our behalf. During the term of the agreement, we must purchase all of our production requirements of zero-emission electric drivetrain systems to be used in Type C and Type D school bus product lines from EDI, and we have agreed that we will not contract with any other manufacturer to produce any zero-emission electric drivetrain systems for use in any Type C or Type D school buses. The agreement, however, does not prevent us from purchasing zero-emission electric drivetrain systems for any other application. The agreement provides that we and EDI will indemnify each other against certain losses resulting from our breach of the agreement and certain other losses. Either party may terminate the agreement for cause upon
 certain events occurring and not being cured within prescribed time frames or without cause upon one hundred eighty days prior written notice to the other. On December 1, 2018, Cummins informed us that it intends to terminate the agreement effective May 3
0, 2019. As of the date of this Annual Report, we 
are in discussions with Cummins regarding the agreement and our future manufacturing process.
 Envirotech Electric Vehicles Incorporated
 Envirotech Electric Vehicles Incorporated (“
Envirotech”
) is a Canadian-based company that is engaged in the design, prototyping and certification of electric components and vehicles, including complete drivetrain systems. We engaged Envirotech to design and build a series of zero-emission electric Class 3–6 tr
ucks, cargo vans and chassis built to our 
specifications and requirements. The vehicles are initially comprised of a cab, chassis and electric drivetrain system. Any customer can then customize the trucks by adding a box or stake bed to the vehicle in accordance with 
their needs. We received the first truck and cargo van pursuant to our arrangement with Envirotech 
in December 2018. Once tested and validated by us, Envirotech will submit the vehicle emissions information to CARB for certification and sale vi
a the issuing of an executive order
. Once the order 
is received, we 
will be able to provide the order 
along with additional information to the Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (“
HVIP”) Department of CARB and apply for HVIP l
isting, which would render 
the trucks eligible for buy-down funding based on the GVWR. These buy-down funds are intended to enable companies to purchase zero-emission electric trucks and receive a discount to aid in the purchase. The HVIP buy-down funding is currently between $50,000 for Class 3 trucks and up to $110,000 for Class 6 trucks.
 GerWeiss EV USA LLC
 GerWeiss EV USA LLC (“GerWeiss”) is a manufacturer 
of zero-emission all-electric vehicles that, to date, has focused on the manufacture of all-electr
ic three-wheeled 
vehicles in the Philippines. In August 2018, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent with GerWeiss in order to explore, together with Envirotech and Amperics, a collaboration to develop and introduce re-powered zero-emission all-ele
ctric transit buses in the Philippines. We are also reviewing GerWeiss’ current conversion design for the light-weight, shorter range three-wheelers in order to determine if the utilization of Amperics’ super-capacitor technology provides a better solution for that market.

Raw Materials and Supply Chain
 Prices for the systems, components and raw materials we use in our drivetrain systems, many of which are OEM items used by many companies in different applications, can fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand. Our purchase of raw materials is currently limited due to sales volume, but we attempt to limit our exposure to raw material price increases and availability fluctuations by having relationships with a dynamic group of vendors that sell us value-added hardware, components and systems. We have further mitigated these supply chain risks by establishing purchasing relationships with multiple vendors that are diversified by type of product offered, brand of products offered, country of origin of products (which is relevant for “Buy American” provisions that we encounter with our customers), individual specification requirements, purchase quantity requirements, quality, availability and price. Our drivetrain systems allow for component substitution, which further mitigates our exposure to any one supplier or component. For example, for different drivetrain systems, our recent traction motor choices have included the following brands: UQM (US), Yasa (UK) and TM4 (China). We believe that we have adequate supplies and access to the sources of the systems, components and materials to meet our current and anticipated future production and supply requirements. 
Backlog
 As of February 8, 2019, our backlog consisted of purchase orders for six zero-emission electric school buses and 42 zero-emission electric drivetrain systems, and as of December 31, 2018, our backlog consisted of purchase orders for six zero-emission electric school buses and 34 zero-emission electric drivetrain systems. We believe
 our costs associated with the current backlog will be approximately $9.4 million
 and that the sale price of the current backlog will be approximately $10.1 million.
 Employees
 As of February 8, 2019, we had 12 full-time employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe our employee relations are good.
 Competition
 The electric vehicle market is highly competitive and we expect it to become even more so in the future as additional companies launch competing products and vehicle offerings. We compete with other alternative energy technologies, such as natural gas, propane and hybrid technologies. The electric competitors include Ford, which produces the Ford Transit Connect EV® and has made recent statements about producing an electric F-150 pickup truck; Nissan which produces a small electric delivery van called the NV200; Rivian, is introducing an electric pick-up truck; General Motors, has made recent statements about considering the production of an electric pick-up truck; Navistar, which produces the Navistar eStar ®; Freightliner, which produces the eM2 and eCascadia electric trucks; Mercedes-Benz, producing the eActros electric truck, has said it will also offer all its commercial van model lines with an electric drive option; Mitsubishi/Fuso produces the eCanter electric truck; Tesla, producing a Class-8 Semi truck also says they will offer an electric pick-up truck; Bollinger Motors, producing the B2 electric pickup truck; Odyne Systems, which produces plug-in hybrid drivetrain systems for trucks and buses; Lightning Systems, which produces re-power electric drivetrain systems for trucks and buses; Lion Electric Company, a Canadian-based manufacturer of Type C, all-electric school buses, and said to soon offer all-electric mini buses and trucks; Nordresa, which produces re-power electric drivetrain systems for cab-forward trucks and package delivery vans; Workhorse, which produces an all-electric walk-in van and an electric pick-up truck called the W-15; Chanje which produces a large electric package delivery van; Zerotruck, which offers an electric cab forward truck; BYD, which manufactures new electric transit buses; Proterra, which manufactures new electric transit buses; TransPower which converts Type D school buses; and Motiv, which converts Type A school buses and package delivery vans.
 Intellectual Property
 The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on intellectual property laws, including trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent laws in the United States and abroad, and use contracts, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property.
 15

As of December 31, 2018, we own three issued U.S. patents, which will expire in 2030 and 2033, and one issued Chinese utility model that will expire in 2026. Domestic and foreign applications are also pending on new inventions. In addition, we maintain a trademark portfolio including common law trademarks and service marks and have two service marks registered in the United States.
 Circumstances outside of our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we provide our solution. In addition, the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business, our ability to compete and harm our operating results. In addition, as the number of competitors grows and solutions of competitors overlap, we may in the future face claims by third parties that we infringe upon or misappropriate their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon or to have misappropriated such rights. In the future, we, or our customers, may be the subject of legal proceedings alleging that our solutions or underlying technology infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others.
 Governmental Programs and Incentives
 We believe that the availability of government subsidies and incentives currently is an important factor considered by our customers when purchasing vehicles that utilize our technology, and that our growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of these subsidies and incentives. Over time, we believe that the importance of the availability of government subsidies and incentives will decrease, as we continue to reduce the upfront cost of vehicles that utilize our technology. In order to help ensure that we and our customers benefit from available subsidies and incentive programs in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Asia and in Europe, we have incentive specialists that work directly with our sales team and our customers on these issues.
Overview of Incentive Programs Most Applicable to Our Products
 We intend to seek to have our products approved for various local, state and federal incentive programs, including those set forth below. In particular, California’s zero-emission vehicle mandate, which requires that a certain percentage of an automobile manufacturer’s sales must be zero-emission vehicles, has r
esulted in numerous incentive programs designed to accelerate the purchase and/or repower of cleaner, more efficient vehicles in California. We anticipate that the relevant aggregate funding available in California alone over the next several years may be 
in excess of $800 million, which includes federal, state and Volkswagen settlement funding sources.
 California Hybrid and Zero-Emissions Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project
 We believe our customers may be eligible for purchase under HVIP. HVIP is a partnership between CARB and CALSTART, the purpose of which is to help speed the early market introduction of clean, low-carbon hybrid and electric trucks and buses. Under HVIP, dealers and fleet operators may request vouchers from HVIP on a first-come first-serve basis, up to the funding amount available for that year, to reduce the cost of purchasing hybrid and zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses.
 HVIP vouchers range in amounts of up to $315,000, depending on the gross vehicle weight of the purchased vehicle and the number of vehicles purchased. School buses would be entitled to up to $220,000 for each new school bus. Each electric vehicle deployed is also eligible for a voucher of up to $30,000 for EVSE installation.
 HVIP funds the purchase of only fully commercialized hybrid and zero-emission trucks and buses. Vehicles still in the demonstration or evaluation stage are not eligible for inclusion in HVIP. Vehicle manufacturers must apply to have their hybrid and zero-emissions trucks and buses included in HVIP’s voucher program. Once a make and model is included in the program, the manufacturer is not required to submit a full application for the succeeding year’s program unless the vehicle has been modified. We intend to comply with the HVIP
 guidelines and qualify our school buses and vehicles for the HVIP vouchers. Blue Bird received HVIP approval for a school bus powered by our drivetrain system on November 7, 2017.

New York Truck Voucher Incentive Program (NYT-VIP)
 NYT-VIP is a first-come, first-served incentive program funded by the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority. The structure and process for fleets to secure incentives is similar to that of HVIP discussed above. Eligible vehicles include all-electric, hybrid-electric, and CNG trucks and buses, along with retrofit diesel-emission control devices. Funding for eligible vehicles domiciled in New York State and New York City can reach $150,000 per vehicle. With the successful listing on the HVIP 
eligibility list of the Blue Bird bus mentioned above, we have 
secured eligibility on the NYT-VIP list and currently qualify for a $150,000 voucher per vehicle. Currently, the funding program has exhausted its funds, but its administrators expect the funds to be replenished in early 2019.
 Drive Clean Chicago-Drive Clean Truck Program
 Drive Clean Chicago is accelerating the adoption of advanced vehicle technologies for the commercial truck and taxi sectors in the Chicago six-county area by reducing the cost of new alternative fuel vehicles and public alternative fuel stations. The program from the Chicago Department of Transportation offers incentives including $10,000 for CNG and electric taxis, up to $150,000 for hybrid and all-electric trucks, and 30% of the capital cost for CNG and fast-charge electric fueling stations.
Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation Trust Funds
 We anticipate that the 23 states that we have prioritized may allocate approximately $200 million in funds per year for the three years begin
ning in 2018 to on-road vehicle projects. Several individual states have provided carve outs specifically for electric vehicles and, in some cases, electric school buses. For example, California, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio have each allocated fun
ds directly to electric school bus projects. The California program will provide per vehicle incentives of $400,000.These states are currently in the process of funding their initial rounds or are developing specific funding plans. We have engaged with several of these states to support the development of such plans.
California Air Resources Board
 CARB gathers air quality data for the State of California, ensures the quality of this data, designs and implements air models, and sets ambient air quality standards for the state, with a particular focus on regulating tailpipe emissions and other mobile sources. CARB compiles the state’s emissions inventory and performs air quality and emissions inventory special studies. CARB uses the Emissions Inventory and Air Quality Models to evaluate air quality and reduce emissions in each of California’s 35 local air districts.
 CARB also manages several incentive and rebate programs and awards hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to reduce emissions from on- and off-road vehicles and equipment. CARB is responsible for program oversight. CARB awards grants and funds through the Air Quality Improvement Program (AB 118); the Carl Moyer Program; the Voucher Incentive Program for enhanced fleet modernization and emission reduction; and the Lower-Emission School Bus Program/School Bus Retrofit and Replacement Account.
 California Energy Commission
 The California Energy Commission (“
CEC”) has several core responsibilities, including but not limited to setting energy policy, developing renewable energy, achieving energy efficiency, and transforming California’s transportation infrastructure. One goal of the CEC is to mitigate GHG emissions and reduce the impact of climate change. The CEC carries out its responsibilities pursuant to several of California’s landmark environmental laws. In 2006, the Legislature passed and then Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed two landmark pieces of legislation with far-reaching implications for energy policy. The most comprehensive is AB 32, 
the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which sets an economy-wide cap on California GHG emissions at 1990 levels by no later than 2020. At the time, this was an aggressive goal that represented an approximately 11% reduction from then-current
 emissions levels and nearly a 30% reduction from projected business-as-usual levels in 2020. In 2015, California passed Senate Bill (SB) 350, which further committed California to reducing GHG emissions by establishing a 2030 greenhouse gas reduction targ
et of 40% below 1990 levels. The transportation sector represents a significant portion of California’s GHG emissions.
 17

In 2007, AB 118 created the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program. The program is intended to increase the use of alternative and renewable fuels and innovative technologies that will transform California’s fuel and vehicle types to help attain the state’s climate change policies. AB 118 authorizes the CEC to provide approximately $100 million annually as incentives to public agencies, vehicle and technology consortia, businesses, public-private partnerships, workforce training partnerships and collaboratives, fleet owners, consumers, recreational boaters, and academic institutions for projects that: develop and improve alternative and renewable low-carbon fuels; optimize alternative and renewable fuels for existing and developing engine technologies; improve light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicle technologies; and retrofit medium-and heavy-duty on-road and non-road vehicle fleets.
 Air Quality Management Districts (“AQMD”) and Air Pollution Control Districts (“APCD”)
 California’s AQMDs/APCDs are responsible for controlling emissions primarily from stationary sources of air pollution such as large power plants and refin
eries, but also have a role in distributing funds and administering incentive programs from mobile sources-primarily cars, trucks and buses, but also construction equipment, ships and trains, from which approximately 75% of emissions are generated. The largest AQMD/APCDs are the South Coast AQMD, Bay Area AQMD, San Joaquin Valley APCD, and the San Diego APCD. Local AQMDs/APCDs develop and adopt an Air Quality Improvement Plans, which serves as the blueprint to bring the respective areas into compliance with federal and state clean air standards. Rules are adopted to reduce emissions from various sources, including specific types of equipment, industrial processes, paints and solvents, even consumer products. Permits are issued to many businesses and industries to ensure compliance with air quality rules. Local AQMDs award grants to help reduce emissions in their local communities. These grants and incentive programs include programs aimed at reducing emissions from mobile sources such as buses and trucks.
Clean Cities
 Clean Cities is a program administered by the DOE’s Office of Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Vehicle Technology Program. According to the DOE, the mission of Clean Cities is to advance the energy, economic, and environmental security of the United States by supporting local decisions to adopt practices that reduce the use of petroleum in the transportation sector. Clean Cities is a government-industry partnership. Under the program, public and private stakeholders from businesses, city and state governments, the automotive industry, fuel providers, and community organizations form coalitions throughout the country, which then work with the DOE to establish a plan for reducing petroleum consumption in their respective geographic areas.
National Clean Diesel Program / Diesel Emissions Reduction Act
 The National Clean Diesel Funding Assistance Program, which is administered by the EPA National Clean Diesel Campaign, provides funding under the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act for projects that seek to reduce emissions from existing diesel engines. Eligible applicants include U.S. regional, state and local agencies that have jurisdiction over transportation or air quality and certain nonprofit institutions that provide pollution reduction or educational services to owners and operators of diesel fleets or that have as their principal purpose the promotion of transportation or air quality. Among the eligible uses of funding under this program are the purchase of buses and medium and heavy-duty trucks that result in reduced diesel emissions.
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (“CMAQ”) Improvement Program
 The CMAQ Improvement Program, which is jointly administered by the Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration, provides funding to states to support surface transportation projects and other related efforts that contribute air quality improvements and provide congestion relief. CMAQ funding is allocated to the states annually based on a statutory formula that is based on population and air quality classification as designated by the EPA. Each state’s transportation department then is responsible for distributing the funds. State transportation departments may spend CMAQ funds on projects that reduce ozone precursors, and at least 16 states have used CMAQ funds for alternative fuel vehicle projects (such as purchasing electric or hybrid vehicles).  
 18

Other State Incentives
 A number of states and municipalities in the United States, as well as certain private enterprises, offer incentive programs to encourage the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, including tax exemptions, tax credits, exemptions and special privileges. For example, Maryland has introduced a voucher program that provides financial assistance
 for the purchase of electric trucks registered in that state, and Arizona exempts use tax and lowers registration fees for the purchase of an electric vehicle. Other states, including Colorado, Georgia, Utah, Florida and West Virginia, provide for substan
tial state tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles.
 Government Regulation
 Our products are designed to comply with a significant number of governmental regulations and industry standards, some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed. Government regulations regarding the manufacture, sale and implementation of products and systems similar to ours are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes may have upon our business. We believe that vehicles that utilize our technology are in conformity with all applicable laws in all relevant jurisdictions.
Emission and Fuel Economy Standards
 Government regulation related to climate change is under consideration at the U.S. federal and state levels. The 
EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“
NHTSA”) issued a final rule for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy requirements for trucks and heavy-duty engines on August 9, 2011, which had an initial phase-in starting with model year 2014 and a final phase-in occurring in model year 2017. NHTSA standards for model years 2014 and 2015 were voluntary, while mandatory standards first went into effect in 2016. In August 2016, the EPA and NHTSA jointly finalized Phase 2 standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles through model year 2027 to improve fleet fuel efficiency and cut carbon emissions.
 The rule provides emission standards for carbon dioxide and fuel consumption standards for three main categories of vehicles: (i) combination tractors, (ii) heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans, and (iii) vocational vehicles. According to the EPA and NHTSA, vocational vehicles consist of a wide variety of truck and bus types, including delivery, refuse, utility, dump, cement, transit bus, shuttle bus, school bus, emergency vehicles, motor homes and tow trucks, and are characterized by a complex build process, with an incomplete chassis often built with an engine and transmission purchased from other manufacturers, then sold to a body manufacturer.
 The EPA an
d NHTSA rule also establishes multiple flexibility and incentive programs for manufacturers of alternatively fueled vehicles, including an engine averaging banking and trading (“
ABT”) program, a vehicle ABT program and additional credit programs for early adoption of standards or deployment of advanced or innovative technologies. The ABT programs allows for emission and/or fuel consumption credits to be averaged, banked or traded within defined groupings of the regulatory subcategories. The additional credit programs allow manufacturers of engines and vehicles to be eligible to generate credits if they demonstrate improvements in excess of the standards established in the rule prior to the model year the standards become effective or if they introduce advanced or innovative technology engines or vehicles.
 Vehicle Safety and Testing
 The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (“
Safety Act”), regulates motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment in the United States in two primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly, in part because the standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards. Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance exists with respect to any of our modified vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.

Battery Safety and Testing
 We believe our battery packs conform to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” which includes lithium-ion batteries that may present a risk in transportation. The governing regul
ations, which are issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations, and related UN Manual of Tests and Criteria. The requirements for shipments of these goods vary by mode of transportation, such as ocean vessel, rail, truck and air.
 Our battery suppliers have completed the applicable transportation tests including:
  
• | Altitude simulation, which involves simulating air transport;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | Thermal cycling, which involves assessing cell and battery seal integrity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Vibration, which involves simulating vibration during transport;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Shock, which involves simulating possible impacts during transport;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | External short circuit, which involves simulating an external short circuit; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Overcharge, which involves evaluating the ability of a rechargeable battery to withstand overcharging.
