 Item 1. Business.
Our Company
 Founded in 1965, Petco is a category-defining health and wellness company focused on improving the lives of pets, pet parents, and our own Petco partners. Building on more than 55 years of providing solutions for pets and the people who love and care for them, in recent years, we have transformed our business from a successful yet traditional retailer to a disruptive, fully-integrated, omnichannel provider of holistic pet health and wellness offerings, including premium products, services, and veterinary care. As a result, we’ve consistently set new standards in pet care while delivering comprehensive pet wellness products, services, and solutions, and creating communities that deepen the pet-pet parent bond.
Through our integrated ecosystem, we provide our over 25 million total active customers with a comprehensive offering of differentiated products and services to fulfill their pets’ health and wellness needs through our more than 1,500 pet care centers in the U.S., Mexico, and Puerto Rico, our digital channel, and our flexible fulfillment options. To further enhance the reach of our product offering and expand our customer base, we’ve implemented partnerships with Lowe’s Companies, Inc. and Canadian Tire Corporation to develop innovative store-in-store concepts at select Lowe’s and Canadian Tire locations that offer a curated assortment of our products.
 Additionally, in 2022, we launched our expansion into rural markets with the opening of our first Neighborhood Farm & Pet Supply pet care centers, which serve as one-stop shops for health and wellness solutions for pets and farm animals in rural communities. These brand-new, stand-alone retail locations are strategically and conveniently situated at the heart of rapidly growing communities, providing us with an opportunity to capture significant incremental market share and share of wallet gains. As of January 28, 2023, we had 5 total Neighborhood Farm & Pet Supply pet care centers across Texas, North Carolina, and Kentucky.
 Our product offering leverages a broad, carefully curated assortment of owned and exclusive merchandise, providing customers with high quality and health-focused nutrition free from artificial ingredients, complemented by a wide variety of premium pet care supplies and companion animals. While we offer pet parents a full spectrum of product choices within our high standards of nutrition and quality, our assortment is weighted towards premium products to address ongoing humanization and premiumization trends in the market.
 We integrate our product offering with our services business, building on the foundation of treating the whole pet, including their physical, mental and social well-being. Our service offering includes a broad suite of pet health services, including veterinary care, grooming, and training. Leveraging our decade of experience in Vetco mobile clinics, which we operate approximately 1,200 of on a weekly basis, we are growing our network of full service, general practice veterinary hospitals complemented by tele-health, prescription and insurance. As of January 28, 2023, we operated 247 full service veterinary hospitals.
 Our multichannel, go-to-market strategy integrates our strong digital assets with our nationwide physical footprint to meet the needs of pet parents who are looking for a single source for all their pet’s needs. Petco.com, our e-commerce site, and the Petco app, our personalized mobile app, together serve as hubs for pet parents to book appointments and manage their pets’ health, wellness, and merchandise needs, while enabling them to shop wherever, whenever, and however they want. By leveraging our extensive physical network of 1,430 pet care centers across the U.S. and Puerto Rico, we are able to offer our comprehensive product and service offering in a localized manner with a meaningful last-mile advantage over much of our competition. Through our connected platform, we serve our customers in a differentiated manner by offering the convenience of repeat delivery, buy online and pick up in store (“BOPUS”), curbside pick-up, same day delivery, and ship from store. In addition to providing differentiated products and services, our over 26,000 knowledgeable, passionate partners in our pet care centers provide important high-quality advice to our customers.
The full value of our health and wellness omnichannel ecosystem is realized for customers through our Vital Care membership program. In January 2023, we unified our over 25 million active customers within a two-tiered offering under Vital Care—Vital Care Core, our free membership tier, and Vital Care Premier, our paid membership tier—to provide for an integrated omnichannel experience. Former members of our Pals Rewards loyalty program, who accounted for over 85% of transactions in fiscal 2022, were transitioned to Vital Care Core, while members of our existing Vital Care program were transitioned to Vital Care Premier, with both tiers retaining the same benefits, and paid members, the same fee. Sitting at the intersection of value and loyalty, Vital Care Premier makes it easier and more affordable for pet parents to care for their pet’s whole health all in one place, and provides pet parents with a seamless connection to our differentiated merchandise and services offerings, while Vital Care Core continues to provide customers with our historic suite of loyalty offerings. Vital Care memberships are the keystone of our

customer-centric model, serving as a driver of repeat visits and engagement among our customers, and we believe the unification of our loyalty and membership programs will enhance the overall customer experience by allowing us to better view and serve our customers through a singular lens.
Industry Dynamics
 The U.S. pet care industry is large and growing, serving millions of households with pets, and represented a total addressable market of approximately $133 billion in 2022. Since 2008, the industry has exhibited steady growth driven by an increase in the underlying pet population coupled with tailwinds associated with trends in pet humanization and a mix-shift towards premiumization. Due to the essential, repeat nature of pet care, the industry has demonstrated resilience and continued growth across economic cycles, as evidenced by the strong industry performance during the Great Recession from 2008 to 2010.
 In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the pet care industry experienced a significant increase in household pets and therefore demand. Beginning in fiscal 2020, U.S. households welcomed millions of incremental new pets into their homes that will need to be fed, groomed, vaccinated, and treated during their lives. Importantly, the majority of these new pet parents came from Millennial and Gen Z generations, who typically spend more on their pets. With respect to our business, we are strategically focused on growing our presence in three of the fastest-growing areas of the market: veterinary care; e-commerce; and services.
As pet care demand continues to grow, over the long-term we believe we are well-positioned to expand our total addressable market through new offerings, and to capture share of the growing market as a fully-integrated, comprehensive pet care provider. Our owned and exclusive merchandise is unique relative to other large players in the category, driving competitive insulation and focusing on long-term growth categories within the pet industry, like fresh and frozen food, as well as premium nutrition and supplies more broadly.
The services categories we participate in within the U.S. are highly fragmented. As consumer expectations around customer experience, convenience, and technology evolve, we believe that we have a competitive advantage versus our competition given the integrated digital experience that we provide our customers, including online booking and customized care reminders, as well as our value offerings like Vital Care Premier.
 We believe that we have built competitive advantages through the breadth and depth of assortment of premium health and wellness products, owned brands, services, and veterinary care that we offer across an integrated omnichannel platform, though we do compete with various peers in individual categories, including both large and small pet specialty retailers, e-commerce retailers, and mass and grocery retailers.
 Our Transformation
 Our transformation over the past five years into the health and wellness company for pets and pet parents has been driven by the relentless execution of our team of channel and category experts with best-in-class experience from Fortune 100 companies, combined with deep experience in retail led by our CEO and Chairman, Ron Coughlin. Our highly qualified leadership team has implemented significant operational and cultural changes in our business, including a substantial acceleration of our digital capabilities, optimizing the effectiveness of pet care center partners through training, enhanced analytics tools and communications, step changing marketing and customer engagement return on investment, launching an owned veterinary hospital network, and scaling our pet health and wellness offerings. Specifically, we have:
 Built Leading Omnichannel Capabilities that Leverage our Physical Network. Following decades of the rise of mega retailers and digital migration, we’ve entered a new era of retail, with consumers seeking fully integrated physical retail and omnichannel digital offerings, brought together with sticky services and enhanced by continuous innovation and an exceptional customer experience. Through that lens, we have developed a data-driven go-to-market platform consisting of robust digital capabilities and a strategic physical network of pet care centers woven together by a singular view of the customer. Our transformation was catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic as pet parents became increasingly comfortable with digital interaction, coupled with a tangible return of retail traffic in 2021 as consumers demonstrated that physical interaction was a critical way in which they want to interact with their retailer too.
Through strategic investments, we’ve rebuilt our digital experience from the ground up beginning with relaunching our e-commerce platform and building an app to integrate with our ecosystem. We invested in improving the speed, navigation, personalization, and services access of our website and app to drive traffic and engagement. We focused on optimizing site merchandising, dynamic pricing capabilities, and leveraging advanced analytics and precision marketing to drive customer acquisition, monetization, and retention.

Further differentiating our business and creating scale advantages, we leverage our physical footprint of pet care centers as micro-distribution centers for our digital orders, including BOPUS, curbside pickup, same day delivery, and ship from store. Nearly all of our 1,430 pet care centers in the U.S. and Puerto Rico offer grooming and training services, in addition to our 247 full-service veterinary hospitals and the approximately 1,200 Vetco mobile clinics operated at our pet care centers on a weekly basis. We also operate 120 locations in Mexico through our joint venture with Grupo Gigante.

Launched a Full-Service Veterinary Hospital Network, and Reinvented Grooming and Training. Pet services represent the most personalized, sticky, high-touch part of the pet market. In addition to acting as a profitable driver of new customer acquisition, we believe our differentiated service platform helps strengthen our position by promoting customer retention, driving physical visit frequency and digital engagement, increasing share of wallet, and building long-term loyalty.
 
In veterinary services, we are creating a new paradigm in the industry with integrated owned hospitals under the Vetco Total Care brand. In fiscal 2017, we embarked on one of the fastest veterinary hospital build-outs in the industry to address the growing need for high quality, accessible pet healthcare consistent with our mission to improve the lives of pets and pet parents. In March 2022, we announced our acquisition of Thrive Pet Healthcare’s 50% stake in our pet hospital joint venture (the “Acquisition”), which subsequently closed in the second quarter of 2022. The Acquisition resulted in the transition of nearly 100 locations to our Vetco Total Care hospital brand, as well as the welcoming of over 750 veterinary care professionals to our network of approximately 29,000 partners. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we operated a total of 247 full-service veterinary care hospitals, inclusive of the hospitals acquired as part of the Acquisition. By integrating these veterinary hospitals into existing pet care centers, we benefit from significant structural advantages compared to stand-alone veterinary care providers, including lower cost of acquisition and additional basket opportunities, driving both incremental service and merchandise sales, and further unlocking the large and growing prescription food and drug total addressable market. In parallel with our hospital unit growth, we’ve made considerable investments in our veterinarian value proposition, both with enhanced total rewards programs as well unique scheduling opportunities that offer the flexibility to practice autonomous medicine both in hospitals and in our mobile clinics. We believe this veterinary model enhances customer lifetime value, drives retention, attracts talent, and delivers long-term value to our stakeholders.
In grooming, we have invested in digital integration, marketing, staff compensation, and other operational improvements, which have resulted in the acquisition of new customers, continued strong sales, and an increase in both groomer hires and retention. In training, we have led with innovation, and in fiscal 2021 we launched online training classes that can be conducted at home.
Created a Highly Differentiated Owned and Exclusive Product Offering. We offer a highly differentiated owned and exclusive product assortment that engenders strong customer loyalty and repeat purchasing. We have focused on three core product differentiating capabilities: nutritional expertise; exclusive partnerships; and a leading owned brand platform. As a testament to our commitment to pet health and wellness, in May 2019 we made the decision to pivot away from dog and cat food and treats that contain artificial ingredients, making us the only major national retailer in the industry to take a stand against artificial ingredients in dog and cat food. We utilized a best brands strategy to form new partnerships with some of the most highly regarded premium food brands in the industry, such as JustFoodForDogs, with whom we expanded our partnership with in March 2022 and created an exclusive owned brand WholeHearted line of frozen meals.
In 2019, we leveraged our established owned brand platform and capabilities to launch Reddy, a fashion-driven supplies brand, to complement WholeHearted, our owned food brand. In fiscal 2022, we generated approximately 27% of our product sales from owned brands—such as WholeHearted, Reddy, and Well & Good. This not only enhances our merchandise mix, but also helps the Petco ecosystem attract and retain customers, and offers an enhanced margin profile. The combination of our food and supplies strategy, including owned and exclusive brands, has enabled us to offer a differentiated assortment of products, many of which are not available via online, mass, or grocery competitors.
Implemented a Performance Culture Led by Data Analytics. Our singular view of the customer across products and services channels, in combination with insights from our Vital Care membership program, online purchasing, surveys, and third party data, provides us with access to some of the richest data in the pet category. By investing in talent and data analytics capabilities, over the past three years we’ve turned analytics and data science into a competitive advantage, including advanced capabilities in dynamic pricing, inventory optimization,

merchandising, personalization, and precision marketing. With the tools to capture purchase, search, and services utilization, as well as customer and pet demographics and preferences, we generate a 360-degree view of customer that serves as the foundation of our data ecosystem.
To enhance decision-making, we implemented new capabilities to leverage this data in our pet care centers, making it available in near real time for our pet care center general managers and field leadership teams through advanced sales reporting. We developed a user-friendly, action-focused dashboard, which enables our managers to track performance across multiple dimensions, identify opportunities, and execute strategies to drive incremental sales. We also simplified the key metrics that we utilize to track performance and align incentives against those metrics by rolling out a revamped incentive structure across our field organization.
 Marketing and Advertising
 Over the last three years, we have significantly elevated our marketing and media strategy, establishing ourselves as a health and wellness leader in the pet category. This repositioning started with bold commitments to pet health and wellness, from eliminating certain food and treats with artificial ingredients, and the removal of human-operated and bark-activated shock collars and traditional rawhide products from our shelves, to becoming the first national pet retailer to be certified by American Humane. Underpinning our differentiated positioning is our precision marketing engine, which starts with applying advanced analytics and data science to our rich first party data. We then deliver personalized messages to the highest value customers, enabling us to drive customer acquisition, monetization, and retention across our ecosystem.

 Human Capital
 Our Partners
Our employees, who we call Petco partners, are our most significant assets, critical to the delivery of our transformation and our continued progress. As of January 28, 2023, we had approximately 29,000 total partners. Our over 26,000 pet care center partners offer a level of customer engagement and content that is differentiated in retail and based on a true passion for pets. Our partners are primarily employed on an at-will basis and are compensated through base salary and incentive programs. We strive for our partners to grow and develop in their careers, and offer competitive compensation and benefits programs, incentive compensation, and a range of health and wellness offerings. None of our partners are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our partners to be good.
Diversity and Inclusion
 Our employees are our partners and we strive to create an environment that embraces diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Our commitment to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment is key to our mission of improving the lives of pets, pet parents, and the Petco partners who work for us. This commitment begins at the top, where our CEO sets annual people goals related to achieving long term workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion outcomes. Progress on our people goals is tracked and reviewed regularly with our executive team and our board of directors, and serves as a component of our CEO’s compensation. We are committed to creating a culture where partners feel as if they can achieve their career goals through ongoing growth and development opportunities, and fair and transparent performance management and promotion processes. So that our partners feel valued and heard, we gather and respond to our partners’ feedback, including, but not limited to, anonymous, periodic, formal, partner engagement surveys, round table sessions, and one-on-one interactions. Based on the feedback received, leaders review and create action plans in an effort to drive meaningful changes in our business. In addition, all Petco leaders participate in diversity, equity, and inclusion training aimed at building respect in the workplace.
Partner Communities
 
We believe that building and supporting connections between our partners and our communities creates a more fulfilling and enjoyable workplace experience. We have continued to expand our partner resource groups, which enable partners to build connections among themselves and their communities, as well as our diversity, inclusion

and belonging programs to encourage partners to bring their “whole selves” to work. Petco currently has seven Partner Resource Groups that are foundational to our culture of inclusion and belonging. Our current partner-led Partner Resource Groups are: Ability at Petco; Black at Petco; LGBTQ+ at Petco; Pan Asian American at Petco; Petcontigo (Latinx) at Petco; Military and Veterans at Petco; and Women at Petco. In partnership with our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion team, these seven groups facilitate engagement activities to increase cultural competencies, educate partners on issues facing affinity group members, and deepen our workplace connections.
 Health and Safety
 The health, safety, and overall well-being of our partners is a top priority. We are focused on protecting and supporting our partners, as well as the people and pets in our pet care centers and the communities we serve. The Petco Partner Assistance Fund has provided over $2 million in financial support to nearly 2,000 Petco partners who suffered a hardship, including related to COVID-19, severe weather events, and natural disasters.
Compensation and Benefits
 We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our partners and their families. In addition to base cash compensation, we offer our partners a mix of annual bonuses, restricted stock units, various incentive plans, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and a range of employee assistance programs. Partners have experienced no increase in their healthcare benefit premiums since 2020, and investments in fertility care, medical travel, and mental health benefits were announced in 2022. In addition, we offer a range of webinars, trainings, and subscriptions to support our partners’ total wellbeing. Finally, in 2022, we announced that every non-trainee partner at Petco will be paid a base wage of at least $15 an hour. This change, along with other adjustments, resulted in approximately 15% average wage increases for our pet care center partners.
 Talent Development
We invest significant resources to attract, develop, and retain top talent. In recent years, we have streamlined methods for setting executional priorities, provided comprehensive sales training, and developed store-level sales marketing capabilities. In fiscal 2022, we are proud to have provided more than 400,000 hours of training across our pet care center partners. In addition, nearly 50% of open General Manager and District General Managers positions were filled with internal promotions.
Distribution
 We currently have seven primary and two regional distribution centers in our network, which are located in various parts of the United States, that handle almost all distribution for our company. Our ship-from-store, BOPUS, and curbside programs enhance our distribution network, affording us the opportunity to utilize our pet care centers as micro-distribution centers to more quickly and cost effectively serve our customers with a last-mile advantage. During fiscal 2022, 74% of our digital orders (including BOPUS, same day delivery, and ship-from-store) were fulfilled by pet care centers.
 The majority of relationships we have with third-party domestic transportation and logistics providers are governed by non-exclusive agreements that do not obligate us to minimum volume or fees, and such agreements may generally be terminated by either party on 45 days’ prior written notice.
 Vendor Arrangements
 In fiscal 2022, we purchased merchandise from approximately 640 vendors. Our top 10 vendors represented approximately 40% of our annual sales, and no single vendor accounted for more than 8% of our sales. In addition, we only sell the products we carry directly to consumers and primarily purchase our products directly from our vendors rather than through third-party distributors. As such, we do not materially rely on third-party distributors to conduct our business. We onboard our vendors using a standardized process to confirm their adherence to our applicable standards, policies, and procedures, including those relating to legal compliance, human rights, standard payment terms, and product quality. These relationships are typically governed by our standard vendor terms and conditions, under which we submit purchase orders to our vendors specifying the types, quantities, and agreed prices for merchandise that we intend to purchase from them. These agreements do not typically have minimum order requirements or exclusivity obligations for either party. Our terms and conditions do not have a set term, but instead allow us to terminate the relationship for convenience at any time upon written notice to the vendor. Our vendors

generally may terminate the relationship on 90-days’ written notice but are obligated to fulfill or perform any purchase order accepted prior to such notice.
 Petco Love
 Petco Love, formerly the Petco Foundation, is a nonprofit organization changing lives by making communities and pet families healthier, stronger, and closer. It is a separately incorporated 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization supported both by contributions from us and contributions from Petco customers and community partners. Since its founding in 1999, Petco Love has inspired and empowered animal welfare organizations to make a difference, investing more than $346 million in adoption and medical care programs, spay/neuter services, pet cancer research, service and therapy animals, and numerous other lifesaving initiatives. Through the Think Adoption First program, Petco Love partners with our pet care centers and animal welfare organizations across the country to increase pet adoptions, helping nearly 7 million pets to date find their new loving families.
 In April 2021, Petco Love launched Petco Love Lost, a searchable database that uses facial recognition technology to help reunite lost pets with their families should they ever go missing. To date, nearly 2,500 animal welfare organizations and pet industry partners across the U.S. have adopted the platform, and Petco Love Lost has helped return over 17,000 pets to their loving homes.
 Launched in August 2021, Petco Love’s Vaccinated and Loved initiative marked a significant milestone when it reached its one millionth free pet vaccine distribution in September 2022, and subsequently committed to distributing another one million free pet vaccines. Since that milestone, Petco Love has distributed an additional 430,000 free pet vaccines to its partners, bringing the total number of free pet vaccines distributed as part of its Vaccinated and Loved initiative to more than 1.3 million to date. Distributing these much-needed vaccinations in under-resourced communities is something Petco Love believes gives all pets the best chance to live long and healthy lives.
 Our Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 We believe that our rights in our intellectual property, including trademarks and domain names, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on access to our proprietary technology, are important to our marketing efforts to develop brand recognition and differentiate our brand from our competitors. We own a number of trademarks that have been registered, or for which registration applications are pending, in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks include Bond & Co., EveryYay, Good 2 Go, Good Lovin’, Harmony, Imagitarium, Leaps & Bounds, Pals Rewards, Petco, Petco Love, PetCoach, PupBox, Reddy, Ruff & Mews, So Phresh, Vetco, Well & Good, WholeHearted, You & Me, Youly, Vital Care Core, and Vital Care Premier. The current registrations of these trademarks are effective for varying periods of time and may be renewed periodically, provided that we, as the registered owner, or our licensees where applicable, comply with all applicable renewal requirements including, where necessary, the continued use of the trademarks in connection with similar goods. We expect to pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe they would be beneficial and cost-effective.
 In addition to trademark protection, we own numerous domain names, including petco.com. We also enter into, and rely on, confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, and business partners to protect our trade secrets, proprietary technology, and other confidential information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our customer terms of use on our website and in our vendor terms and conditions.
 Government Regulation
 We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public health, natural resources, and the environment. Our operations, including our owned brand manufacturing outsourcing partners, are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), the Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”), and by various other federal, state, local, and foreign authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, and import of our products, including food safety standards. For more information, please read “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters—Our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and we may incur material liabilities under, or costs in order to comply with, existing or future laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with

such laws and regulations may result in enforcements, recalls, and other adverse actions that could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results.”
 The FDA regulates animal feed, including pet food, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (the “FFDCA”), and its implementing regulations. Although pet foods are not required to obtain premarket approval from the FDA, the FFDCA requires that all animal foods are safe for consumption, produced under sanitary conditions, contain no harmful substances, and are truthfully labeled. Most states also require that pet foods distributed in the state be registered or licensed with the appropriate state regulatory agency. In addition, most facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods, including pet foods, must register with the FDA and renew their registration every two years, and are subject to periodic FDA inspection. This includes most foreign, as well as domestic facilities. Registration must occur before the facility begins its pet food manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding operations.
 The labeling of pet foods is regulated by both the FDA and some state regulatory authorities. FDA regulations require proper identification of the product, a net quantity statement, a statement of the name and place of business of the manufacturer or distributor, and proper listing of all the ingredients in order of predominance by weight. Most states also enforce their own labeling regulations, many of which are based on model definitions and guidelines developed by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (the “AAFCO”). AAFCO is a voluntary, non-governmental membership association of local, state, and federal agencies that are charged with regulation of the sale and distribution of animal feed, including pet foods. The degree of oversight of the implementation of these regulations varies by state, but typically includes a state review and approval of each product label as a condition of sale in that state.
 The FDA also regulates the inclusion of specific claims in pet food labeling. For example, pet food products that are labeled or marketed with claims that may suggest that they are intended to treat or prevent disease in pets would potentially meet the statutory definitions of both a food and a drug. The FDA has issued guidance regarding products that provide nutrients in support of an animal’s daily nutrient needs but which are also labeled as being intended for use to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease, thereby meeting the statutory definitions of both a food and a drug.
Under Section 423 of the FFDCA, the FDA may require the recall of an animal feed product if there is a reasonable probability that the product is adulterated or misbranded and the use of or exposure to the product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death. In addition, pet food manufacturers may voluntarily recall or withdraw their products from the market.
 Certain states have laws, rules, and regulations that require that veterinary medical practices be either wholly owned or majority owned by licensed veterinarians and that corporations that are not wholly owned or majority owned by licensed veterinarians refrain from providing, or holding themselves out as providers of, veterinary medical care, or directly employing or otherwise exercising control over veterinarians providing such care. In these states and jurisdictions, we provide management and other administrative services to veterinary practices rather than owning such practices or directly employing the veterinarians providing medical care. Although we believe that we have structured our operations to comply with our understanding of the veterinary medicine laws of each state and jurisdiction in which we operate, interpretive legal precedent and regulatory guidance varies by jurisdiction and is often sparse and not fully developed.
 In addition, all of the states in which we operate impose various registration permit and/or licensing requirements. To fulfill these requirements, we have registered each of our facilities with appropriate governmental agencies and, where required, have appointed a licensed veterinarian to act on behalf of each facility. All veterinarians practicing in our animal wellness centers are required to maintain valid state licenses to practice and veterinarians practicing in our full-service hospitals are required to maintain valid licenses with the DEA. We are also required to comply with state laws governing the dispensing of prescription pet medications by our veterinarians. Additionally, our pet insurance plans must be registered with certain state departments of insurance and comply with their requirements.
