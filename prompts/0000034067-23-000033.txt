If the Put Option is exercised, the Option Purchase Price will be paid, at DMC’s option, (i) in cash or (ii) 20% in cash and 80% in shares of preferred stock of the Company. If the Company exercises the Call Option, the Option Purchase Price will be paid in cash. The Operating Agreement also provides for rights of first refusal and “drag-along” rights pursuant to which we could, in certain circumstances, acquire Munera’s interests prior to the third anniversary of the effective date of the agreement. 
DynaEnergetics
DynaEnergetics designs, manufactures, markets and sells perforating systems and associated hardware for the global oil and gas industry. During the well drilling process, steel casing is inserted into the well and cemented in place to isolate and support the integrity of the wellbore. A perforating system, which contains a series of specialized explosive shaped charges, is used to punch holes through the casing and cement liner of the well and into the geologic formation surrounding the well bore. The channels created by the shaped charges allow hydrocarbons to flow back into the wellbore. When hydraulic fracturing is employed, the perforations and channels also provide a path for the fracturing fluid to enter and return from the formation. 
In unconventional wells, multiple perforating systems, which generally range from seven inches to three feet in length, are connected end-to-end into a perforating “string.” The string is lowered into the well and then pumped by fluid across the horizontal lateral to the target location within the shale formation. When the perforating system is initiated via an electronic or digital signal from the surface, the shaped charges detonate. DynaEnergetics designs, manufactures and sells all five primary components of a perforating system: the initiation system, shaped charges, detonating cord, gun hardware, and a control panel.
In North America’s well-completion industry, perforating components traditionally have been assembled by highly trained personnel at the well site or nearby assembly facility. In 2015, DynaEnergetics began assembling its perforating systems 
in a controlled environment at its manufacturing facilities. The systems, marketed as DynaStage® (DS) Factory-Assembled, Performance-Assured™ perforating systems, are shipped directly to the customers’ remote shop or well site. Since 2015, DynaEnergetics has added several new DS products to accommodate evolving industry conditions and needs. 
Operations
The DynaEnergetics segment seeks to build on its products and technologies, as well as its sales, supply chain and distribution network. During the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the DynaEnergetics segment represented approximately 40%, 67% and 64% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. 
DynaEnergetics’ operates manufacturing facilities in Germany and the United States. In Troisdorf, Germany, DynaEnergetics has six IS2TM detonator manufacturing lines, two shaped charge lines and a detonating cord manufacturing line. In Liebenscheid, Germany, DynaEnergetics operates a manufacturing facility for perforating guns and associated hardware. In the United States, DynaEnergetics has three shaped charge manufacturing lines in Blum, Texas where product assembly and metal fabricating also occur. We have a second metal fabricating facility in Whitney, Texas. These locations provide us with global capacity for shaped charge and perforating gun production and enhance our delivery and customer service capabilities in our key markets.
Products
IS2: DynaEnergetics has focused on the advancement of safe and selective perforating products for use in North America’s shale, or onshore, unconventional, oil and gas industry. Among these products are the IS2™ Intrinsically Safe Initiating Systems, which include the IS2TM Customer Assembled (CA) detonator and the wire-free, plug-in, IS2 Top Fire (TF) detonator. The IS2 TF detonator is the key enabling technology in DynaEnergetics’ family of DS Factory-Assembled, Performance-Assured perforating systems. The IS2 detonators require a specific digital code for firing and are immune from induced currents and voltages, static electricity and high-frequency irradiation. These safety features substantially reduce the risk of unintentional detonation and enable concurrent perforating and hydraulic fracturing operations at well sites with multiple wellbores, improving operating efficiencies for customers. In response to the exacting needs of our customers, we worked throughout 2022 to expand and enhance the IS2 product line, including adding an IS2 MS igniter specifically designed for our DS MicroSet™. We also began a transition to our most technically advanced detonator, the IS2 Xpress.
DS Systems: Our DS InfinityTM Factory-Assembled, Performance-Assured perforating systems combine all of our advanced technologies into a preassembled perforating gun that is armed at the well site with our Plug-and-Go™ IS2 TF detonator. The IS2 TF detonator is wire-free and eliminates the customary process of wiring the detonator into the perforating system at the well site. All DS systems are operated using our in-house designed and manufactured InfinityTM Control Panel. The Infinity Panel is highly intuitive and allows the gun string to be safely tested and monitored throughout the pump-down operation. The system also incorporates a shot detection function resulting in significant time and cost savings. Recent design advancements to the IS2 line of initiation products enable customers to safely and reliably fire up to 100 systems and set a plug in a single run. All DS systems can be tested before going down hole using our Infinity Surface Tester, reducing the risk of lost time, mishaps, misruns and misfires due to a system fault.
DynaEnergetics has expanded the family of DS perforating systems with various models: DS Echo™, for re-frac applications; DS Gravity™, a self-orienting system for oriented perforating; and DS LoneStar™, a single-shot system that delivers large, ultra-consistent entry holes. DS Trinity™, an ultra-compact system that features three explosive shaped charges on a single or dual radial plane; and DS NLine™, an oriented systems that features several shaped charges on a lateral plane. During 2022, DynaEnergetics continued to refine its systems to further improve reliability and worked to expand our product offerings. In 2022, we successfully launched an expanded 3.5” diameter product building on the success of DS Lonestar™.
Shaped Charges: DynaEnergetics develops and sells a wide range of shaped charges for use in its perforating systems, including the LoneStar and EchoFrac™ charges specifically designed for sale in their respective systems. DynaEnergetics also sells HaloFrac™ charges, which incorporate advancements in liner materials and shaped charge geometry to improve hydraulic fracturing performance, the FracTune™ family of shaped charges, which delivers uniform hole diameter in the well casing independent of shot phasing and gun positioning within the well bore, and the DPEX™ family of charges, which feature energetic liners. All three charge lines can be used with the DynaStage perforating system as well as conventional perforating gun systems across a range of gun diameters. In 2022, DynaEnergetics further expanded its portfolio of equal-entry hole shaped charges, in particular targeting the precise requirements of orientated perforating applications in the plug and perforating market. These charges enable exploration and production companies and their wireline service providers to choose from a variety of specifically designed shaped charges to match well completion design requirements. 
TCP Systems: DynaEnergetics Tubing Conveyed Perforating ("TCP") systems are customized for individual customer needs and well applications. TCP enables perforating of conventional vertical wells, as well as highly deviated and horizontal wells. These types of wells are increasingly being drilled by the off-shore industry and in applications outside the U.S. TCP tools also perforate long intervals in a single trip, which significantly improves rig efficiency. Our TCP tool range includes mechanical and hydraulic firing systems, gun releases, redundant firing heads, under-balancing devices and auxiliary components. Our tools are designed to withstand downhole temperatures of up to 260 degrees Celsius (500 degrees Fahrenheit) for safe and quick assembly at the well site and to allow unrestricted total system length.
Setting and Ballistic Release Tools: DynaEnergetics also sells products that perform critical downhole functions associated with the perforating process. DS MicroSet™ is a compact, disposable setting tool used to install the frac plugs that isolate stages in a multi-stage, unconventional oil or gas well. DS Liberator™ is a ballistic release tool that enables the wireline service company to disengage from a perforating string that has become stuck in the well bore.
Plug and Abandonment: Our DynaSlotTM perforating system is designed for plug and abandonment (P&A) operations. During well abandonment, the wellbore is encased and permanently sealed so that layers of sedimentary rock, and in particular freshwater aquifers, are pressure isolated from each other and the wellbore. The DynaSlot perforating system facilitates this process by creating access to a full 360-degree area between the rock formations and the tubing and/or casing. Customers use the unique helical perforation pattern created by DynaSlot to perform cement squeeze operations that seal off the wellbore. DynaEnergetics maintains its DPU and XPU shaped charge lines, which are designed for P&A and well remediation applications and enable perforating through two or more layers of casing and into the formation. DynaEnergetics also has successfully developed an encapsulated DynaSlot charge specifically designed for cutting down hole control lines. Most recently, DynaEnergetics developed its next generation DynaSlot shaped charges, designed specifically for severing and cutting flat-pack control lines, which are mounted vertically behind the wellbore tubulars. Cutting control-lines without damaging the well's integrity is a critical step in the process of permanently decommissioning offshore wells. 
Geothermal: In 2022, DynaEnergetics successfully developed and provided a complete perforating string-design for a new geothermal project in Europe. Applying its experience and latest perforating technology, DynaEnergetics was able to offer a solution to meet the requirements of the challenging well design and new application. DynaEnergetics plans to continue work on this application through 2023. 
Mining Applications: In 2020, DynaEnergetics introduced Igneo™, a specialized initiating system for use in high-temperature mining applications. Igneo incorporates the same intrinsically safe features found in the IS2 initiating system used by the oil and gas industry.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
DynaEnergetics' product offering consists of complex components that require numerous high-end inputs. DynaEnergetics utilizes a variety of raw materials for the production of oilfield perforating and seismic products, including high-quality steel tubes, steel and copper, explosives, granulates, plastics and ancillary plastic product components. DynaEnergetics obtains its raw materials primarily from a number of different producers in Germany, other European countries, and the U.S., but also purchases materials from other international suppliers.
Competition
DynaEnergetics faces competition from independent manufacturers of perforating products and from the industry's three largest oil and gas service companies, which produce perforating systems for their own use but also buy systems and other perforating components and specialty products from independent suppliers such as DynaEnergetics. We compete for sales primarily on customer service, product quality, reliability, safety, performance, price and, in North America, our ability to provide customers with a Factory-Assembled, Performance-Assured perforating system, versus a series of components that must be assembled at a well site or nearby staging facility.
Customer Profile
DynaEnergetics' perforating and seismic products are purchased by international and U.S. oilfield service companies of all sizes working in both onshore and offshore oil and gas fields. Our customers select perforating products based on their leading performance, system compatibility, product pricing, and ability to address a broad spectrum of factors, including pressures and temperatures in the wellbore and geological characteristics of the targeted formation.
The customers for our energy products can be divided into five broad categories: purchasing centers of large service companies, international service companies, independent international and North America-based service companies (often referred to as “wireline” companies), E&P companies, and local resellers.
Marketing, Sales, Distribution
DynaEnergetics’ worldwide marketing and sales efforts for its oilfield and seismic products are located in Troisdorf, Germany and Houston, Texas. DynaEnergetics’ sales strategy focuses on direct selling, distribution through licensed distributors and independent sales representatives, education of current and prospective service-company customers about our products and technologies, and education of E&P companies about the benefits of our products and technologies in an effort to generate pull-through demand. Currently, DynaEnergetics sells its oilfield and seismic products through wholly owned affiliates in Germany, the U.S., and Canada, and through independent sales agents in other parts of the world. DynaEnergetics serves the Americas region through its network of sales and distribution centers in the United States and Canada. In 2021, DynaEnergetics upgraded its website and launched a mobile version of its app to provide better information and tools to our customers and E&P companies as they select their completion systems, place orders, and track deliveries.
DynaEnergetics also designs and manufactures customized perforating products for third-party customers according to their designs and requirements.
Research and Development
DynaEnergetics devotes substantial resources to its research and development (R&D) programs. Based predominantly in Troisdorf, Germany, the R&D team works closely with sales, product management, and operations management teams to establish priorities and effectively manage individual projects. Through its ongoing involvement in oil and gas industry trade shows and conferences, DynaEnergetics has increased its profile in the oil and gas industry. In addition to its existing shaped charge test facility, which can simulate downhole, wellbore, and reservoir pressure conditions to develop and test high performance perforating charges for both oil companies and service providers, the R&D group has a purpose-built pressure vessel which can reach 30,000 psi test pressures and be heated to up to 200 degrees Celsius (392 degrees F). This enables the R&D group to support the oil and gas industry with test methods for new products that realistically simulate potentially difficult downhole conditions. An R&D plan, which focuses on new technology, products, process support and contracted projects, is prepared and reviewed at least quarterly. R&D costs were $5,712, $6,378, and $6,335 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
NobelClad
Explosion-welded cladding technology is a method for welding metals that cannot be joined using conventional welding processes, such as titanium-steel, aluminum-steel, and aluminum-copper. Explosion welding also can be used to weld compatible metals, such as stainless steels and nickel alloys to steel. The cladding metals are typically titanium, stainless steel, aluminum, copper alloys, nickel alloys, tantalum, and zirconium. The base metals are typically carbon steel, alloy steel, stainless steel and aluminum. 
Explosion-welded clad metal is produced as flat plates or concentric cylinders, which can be further formed and fabricated into a broad range of industrial processing equipment or specialized transition joints. Created using a robust cold-welding technology, explosion-welded clad products exhibit high bond strength, which is generally stronger than the parent metals. The dimensional capabilities of the process are broad: cladding metal layers can range from a few thousandths of an inch to several inches in thickness and base metal thickness and lateral dimensions are primarily limited by the capabilities of the world’s metal production mills. 
Clad metal plates are used in the construction of heavy, corrosion resistant pressure vessels and heat exchangers. Clad metal plates consist of a thin layer of an expensive, corrosion-resistant clad metal, such as titanium or nickel alloy, which is metallurgically welded to a less expensive structural backing metal, such as carbon steel. For heavy equipment, clad plates generally provide an economical alternative to building the equipment solely out of a corrosion-resistant alloy. While a significant portion of the demand for our clad metal products is driven by maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing, petrochemical processing, oil refining, and aluminum smelting facilities, new plant construction and large plant expansion projects also account for a significant portion of total demand. These industries tend to be cyclical in nature, and the timing of new order inflow remains difficult to predict. 
Clad Metal End-Use Markets

The eight broad industrial sectors discussed below comprise the bulk of demand for NobelClad’s products, with oil and gas and chemical and petrochemical constituting approximately 60% of NobelClad sales in 2022. This demand is driven by the underlying need for both new equipment and facility maintenance in these primary market sectors. 
Oil and Gas: Oil and gas end use markets include both oil and gas production and petroleum refining. Oil and gas production covers a broad scope of operations related to recovering oil and/or gas for subsequent processing in refineries. Clad metal is used in separators, glycol contractors, pipelines, heat exchangers and other related equipment. Clad equipment is also advantageous for oil and gas production from deep, hot, and more corrosive fields. The primary clad metals for the oil and gas production market are stainless steel and nickel alloys clad to steel, with some use of reactive metals such as titanium.
Petroleum refining processes frequently are corrosive and operate at high temperatures and pressures. Clad metal is extensively used in a broad range of equipment including desulfurization hydrotreaters, coke drums, distillation columns, separators and heat exchangers. Reliance upon low-quality, high-sulfur crude drives demand for new corrosion resistant equipment. Regulatory controls of sulfur emissions in gas, diesel and jet fuel also impact the need for clad equipment. Like the upstream oil and gas sector, the clad metals are primarily stainless steel and nickel alloys. 
Chemical and Petrochemical: Many common products, ranging from plastics to prescription drugs to electronic materials, are produced by chemical processes. Because the production of these items often involves corrosive agents and is conducted under high pressures or temperatures, corrosion resistant equipment is needed. One of the larger applications for clad equipment is in the manufacture of purified terephthalic acid (PTA), a precursor product for polyester, which is used in products as diverse as carpets and plastic bottles. The chemical market requires extensive use of stainless steel and nickel alloys, but also uses titanium, zirconium and tantalum.
Alternative Energy: Some alternative energy technologies involve conditions that necessitate clad metals. Solar panels predominantly incorporate high purity polysilicon. Processes for manufacturing high purity silicon utilize a broad range of highly corrosion-resistant clad alloys. Many geothermal fields are corrosive, requiring high alloy clad separators to handle the hot steam. In addition, some ethanol technologies and concentrating solar power technologies may require corrosion resistant metals at thicknesses where clad is an attractive alternative.
Hydrometallurgy: The processes for production of nickel, gold, and copper involve acids, high pressures, and high temperatures, and titanium-clad plates are used extensively for construction of associated leaching and peripheral equipment such as autoclaves.
Aluminum Production: Primary aluminum is reduced from its oxide in large electric smelters called potlines. The electric current is carried via aluminum conductors. The electricity must be transmitted into steel components for the high temperature smelting operations. Aluminum cannot be welded to steel conventionally. Explosion-welded aluminum-steel transition joints provide an energy efficient and highly durable solution for making these connections. Modern potlines use a large number of transition joints, which are typically replaced after approximately five years in service. Although primary aluminum production is the major electrochemical application for NobelClad products, there are a number of other electrochemical applications including production of zinc, magnesium, chlorine and chlorate. We are seeing an increase for equipment related to processing biomass feedstocks and biofuel end products, mostly stainless and nickel alloy clad.
Shipbuilding: The combined problems of corrosion and top-side weight drive demand for our aluminum-steel transition joints, which serve as the juncture between a ship's upper and lower structures. Top-side weight is often a significant problem with tall ships, including cruise ships, naval vessels, ferries and yachts. Use of aluminum in the upper structure and steel in the lower structure provides stability. Since aluminum cannot be welded directly to steel using conventional welding processes, and since bolted joints between aluminum and steel corrode quickly in seawater, explosion-welded transition joints are a common solution.
Power Generation: Fossil fuel and nuclear power generation plants require extensive use of heat exchangers, many of which require corrosion resistant alloys to handle low quality cooling water. Our clad plates are used for heat exchanger tube sheets, and the largest clad tube sheets are used in the final low-pressure condensers. For most coastal and brackish water-cooled plants, titanium is the metal of choice, and titanium-clad tube sheets are the low-cost solution for power plant condensers.
Industrial Refrigeration: Heat exchangers are a core component of refrigeration systems. When the cooling fluid is seawater, brackish, or even slightly polluted, corrosion-resistant metals are necessary. Metal selection can range from stainless 
steel to copper alloy to titanium. Explosion-welded clad metal is often the low-cost solution for making the tube sheets. Applications range from refrigeration chillers on fishing boats to massive air conditioning units for skyscrapers, airports, and deep underground mines. 
New Applications/Industry Development
NobelClad continues its efforts in applications and materials innovations, with the goal of expanding NobelClad’s end-use markets and customer base. Examples of these efforts include the development of a new application of clad in the production of engineered wood, development of improved electrical transition joints for smelting applications, high-pressure refractory metals chemical processing pipe systems and cryogenic joints to LNG and air separation units. NobelClad is also engaged in research efforts related to using clad products in concentrating solar power production facilities.
Operations
During the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the NobelClad segment represented approximately 14%, 33% and 36% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. Our manufacturing plants and their respective shooting sites in Pennsylvania and Germany provide the production capacity to address projects for NobelClad’s global customer base. 
NobelClad uses proprietary processes and technology to produce high quality clad metal products and limit re-work costs. The entire explosion-welding process involves significant precision in all stages, and any errors can be extremely costly as they often result in the discarding of the expensive raw material metals. NobelClad’s technological expertise helps ensure precision, minimize errors, and prevent costly waste.
NobelClad’s metal products are primarily produced for custom projects and conform to requirements set forth in customers’ purchase orders. Upon receipt of an order, NobelClad obtains the component materials from a variety of sources based on quality, availability and cost and then produces the order in one of its manufacturing plants. Final products are processed to meet contract specific requirements for product configuration and quality/inspection level.
Products
NobelClad manufacturing technology is used in a variety of product applications.
DetaClad™:  Our explosion clad plates and cylinders, available in 260 compatible and non-compatible metal combinations, are the basis of the world’s pressure vessels, towers and crystallizers used in many industries.
Tube Sheets: Our clad tube sheets are made from corrosion-resistant alloys, making them ideal for applications ranging from refrigeration chillers on fishing boats to air conditioners for use in food and pharmaceutical manufacturing.
Vessel Heads & Cylinders: NobelClad delivers high-quality clad heads of all sizes for reactors, heat exchangers and process vessels. We adapt our head forming process to specific clad metal combinations.
Structural Transition Joints: NobelClad’s structural transition joints permanently join metals without mechanical fasteners. Shipbuilders turn to us to connect superstructures and bulkheads to steel hulls, framing and deck components.
Electrical Transition Joints: NobelClad’s electrical transition joints offer strong, low electrical resistance solutions for aluminum and zinc smelting, when anode clad and cathode applications must operate at elevated temperatures.
Cylindra™ Cryogenic Transition Joints: Compared with bolted connection systems, Cylindra offers an easier, more reliable way to connect stainless steel to aluminum pipes for producing LNG and industrial gases in Air Separation Units (ASU).
DetaPipe™ Spools, Elbows and Branches: NobelClad offers reactive metal pipe spools and elbows for piping systems in demanding high-pressure and high-temperature processes. This new technology allows for end users to benefit from the corrosion resistance performance and process safety that metals like zirconium, titanium and tantalum provide.
Suppliers and Raw Materials

NobelClad's operations involve a range of alloys, steels and other materials, such as stainless steel, copper alloys, nickel alloys, titanium, zirconium, tantalum, aluminum and other metals. NobelClad sources its raw materials from a number of different producers and suppliers. It holds a limited metal inventory and purchases its raw materials based on contract specifications. Under most contracts, any raw material price increases are passed on to NobelClad’s customers. NobelClad closely monitors the quality of its supplies and inspects the type, dimensions, markings, and certification of all incoming metals to ensure that the materials will satisfy applicable construction codes. NobelClad also manufactures a majority of its own explosives from standard raw materials, and we believe that this allows us to achieve higher quality and lower cost.
Competition

Hot Roll Bonding and Weld Overlay.  NobelClad faces competition from two primary alternative cladding technologies: hot roll bonding and weld overlay. Usually, the three processes do not compete directly, as each has its own preferential domain of application relating to metal used and thicknesses required. However, specific project considerations such as technical specifications, price and delivery time, may allow these technologies to compete more directly with explosion-welding. Roll bond is only produced by a few steel mills in the world. In this process, the clad metal and base metal are bonded during the hot rolling operation in which the metal slab is converted to plate. The weld overlay process is used by the many vessel fabricators that are often also NobelClad customers. In weld overlay cladding, the clad metal layer is deposited on the base metal using arc-welding type processes.
Explosion-Welded Metal Cladding. Worldwide competition in the explosion-welded clad metal business is fragmented, and we believe that NobelClad holds a strong market position in the industry. Within North America, NobelClad is one of the largest producers of explosion-welded clad products. In Europe, its manufacturing capacity gives NobelClad a strong position against smaller competitors. In Asia, NobelClad has mixed competition ranging from competitors with strong brand names and competitive technology to other producers that are technically limited and offer minimal exports outside of their domestic markets. To remain competitive, NobelClad intends to continue developing and providing technologically advanced manufacturing services, maintaining quality levels, offering flexible delivery schedules, delivering finished products on a reliable basis and competing favorably on the basis of price.
Customer Profile

NobelClad’s customers can be divided into three tiers: the product end users (e.g., operators of chemical processing plants, and aluminum smelting plants), the engineering contractors that design and construct plants for end users, and the metal fabricators that manufacture the products or equipment that utilize NobelClad’s metal products. It is typically the fabricator that places the purchase order with NobelClad and pays the corresponding invoice. NobelClad has developed strong relationships over the years with the engineering contractors, process licensors, and equipment operating companies that frequently act as buying agents for fabricators.
Marketing, Sales, Distribution

NobelClad conducts its selling efforts by marketing its services to potential customers' senior management, direct sales personnel, program managers, and independent sales representatives. Prospective customers in specific industries are identified through networking in the industry, cooperative relationships with suppliers, public relations, customer references, inquiries from technical articles and seminars, website inquiries, webinars, and trade shows. NobelClad’s sales office in the United States covers both North and South America. Its sales offices in Europe cover the full European continent, Africa, the Middle East, and India. NobelClad also has a sales office in South Korea to address the Asian markets and uses contract agents to cover various other countries. Contract agents typically work under multi-year agreements which are subject to sales performance targets as well as compliance with NobelClad quality, customer service and compliance expectations. By maintaining relationships with its existing customers, developing new relationships with prospective customers, and educating all its customers as to the technical benefits of NobelClad’s products, NobelClad endeavors to assist in setting standard specifications, both by our customers and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and ASTM International, to ensure that the highest quality and reliability are achieved. 

NobelClad’s products are generally shipped from its manufacturing locations in the United States and Germany. Any shipping costs or duties for which NobelClad is responsible typically will be included in the price paid by the customer. Regardless of where the sale is booked, NobelClad will produce it, capacity permitting, at the location closest to the delivery place. In the event that there is a short-term capacity issue at one facility, NobelClad can produce the order at its other 
production site, prioritizing timing. The two production sites allow NobelClad to meet customer production needs in a timely manner.
Research and Development

We prepare a formal research and development plan annually. It is implemented at our cladding sites and is supervised by a technical committee that reviews progress quarterly and meets once a year to establish the plan for the following twelve months. The research and development projects concern process support, new products, new applications, and special customer-paid projects.
Corporate History and Recent Developments

The Company originated as an unincorporated business called “Explosive Fabricators,” which was formed in Colorado in 1965. The business was incorporated in Colorado in 1971 under the name “E. F. Industries, Inc.,” which was later changed to “Explosive Fabricators, Inc.” The Company became publicly traded in 1976. In 1994, it changed its name to “Dynamic Materials Corporation.” The Company reincorporated in Delaware in 1997.

From 1976, the Company operated as a licensee of DetaClad, the explosion-welded clad process developed by DuPont in 1959. In 1996, the Company purchased the DetaClad operating business from DuPont.
In 2001, the Company acquired substantially all of the stock of NobelClad Europe SA, a French company (“NobelClad Europe”), which had also been a licensee of the DetaClad technology. The acquisition of NobelClad Europe expanded the Company’s explosive metalworking operations to Europe.

In 2007, the Company acquired the German company DynaEnergetics GmbH and Co. KG (“DynaEnergetics”) and certain affiliates. DynaEnergetics was comprised of two primary businesses: explosive metalworking and energy products. This acquisition expanded the Company’s explosive metalworking operations in Europe and added a complementary energy products business.
In 2013, the Company branded its explosive metalworking operations under the single name NobelClad. The NobelClad segment is comprised of the Company’s U.S. clad operations as well as the explosion metalworking assets and operations purchased in the NobelClad Europe and DynaEnergetics acquisitions. In 2014, the Company re-branded the energy products segment as DynaEnergetics.  
In 2014, the Company acquired a modern manufacturing and office complex in Liebenscheid, Germany. The facility enhances NobelClad's manufacturing capabilities and serves as a state-of-the-art production and administrative resource for NobelClad's European operations and also serves as a production resource for DynaEnergetics.
In 2016, the Company changed its name to DMC Global Inc. to reflect that we are a diversified portfolio of technical product and process businesses serving niche markets around the world.
In 2018, NobelClad completed the consolidation of its European explosion-welding operations into its manufacturing facility in Liebenscheid, Germany. DynaEnergetics expanded its North American operations, adding 74,000 square feet of manufacturing, assembly and administrative space on its Blum, Texas campus. 
In 2019, DynaEnergetics completed a series of capacity expansion initiatives at its manufacturing facilities in North America and Germany. Capitalizing on its more efficient manufacturing footprint, DynaEnergetics ceased its operations in Tyumen, Siberia, and during the third quarter of 2020, DynaEnergetics sold the land and buildings in Tyumen, Siberia to a third-party. Additionally in 2019, the Company internally restructured its European entities and simplified its legal structure. The new structure took effect on January 1, 2020, and reduces the number of legal entities, minimizes complexity and enables the Company to reduce its annual compliance and administration costs and manage global tax reform more effectively. 
In 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of 60% of the membership interests in Arcadia. This acquisition diversified the markets and industries in which we operate and dramatically expanded our addressable markets.
