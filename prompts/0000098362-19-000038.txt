Engineered Bearings:
The Timken® bearing portfolio features a broad range of engineered bearing products, including tapered, spherical and cylindrical roller bearings; thrust and ball bearings; and housed units. Timken is a leading authority on tapered roller bearings, and leverages its position by applying engineering know-how and technology across its entire bearing portfolio.
A bearing is a mechanical device that reduces friction between moving parts. The purpose of a bearing is to carry a load while allowing a machine shaft to rotate freely. The basic elements of the bearing generally include two rings, called races; a set of rolling elements that rotate around the bearing raceway; and a cage to separate and guide the rolling elements. Bearings come in a number of designs, featuring tapered, spherical, cylindrical or ball rolling elements. The various bearing designs accommodate radial and/or thrust loads differently, making certain bearing types better suited for specific applications. 
Selection and development of bearings for customer applications and demand for high reliability require sophisticated engineering and analytical techniques. High precision tolerances, proprietary internal geometries and quality materials provide Timken bearings with high load-carrying capacity, excellent friction-reducing qualities and long service lives. The uses for bearings are diverse and can be found in transportation applications that include passenger cars and trucks, heavy trucks, helicopters, airplanes and trains. Ranging in size from precision bearings the size of a pencil eraser to those roughly three meters in diameter, Timken components also are used in a wide variety of industrial applications, including: paper and steel mills, mining, oil and gas extraction and production, agriculture, construction, machine tools, gear drives, health and positioning control, wind turbines and food processing.

Services accounted for approximately 5% of the Company’s net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Sales and Distribution:
Timken products are sold principally by its internal sales organizations. A portion of each segment's sales are made through authorized distributors. 
Customer collaboration is central to the Company's sales strategy. Therefore, Timken goes where its customers need us, with sales engineers primarily working in close proximity to customers rather than at production sites. In some cases, Timken may co-locate with a customer at its facility to ensure optimized collaboration. The Company's sales force continuously updates the team's training and knowledge regarding all friction management products and market sector trends, and Timken employees assist customers during development and implementation phases and provide ongoing service and support.
The Company has a joint venture in North America focused on joint logistics and e-business services. This joint venture, CoLinx, LLC, includes five equity members: Timken, SKF Group, Schaeffler Group, ABB Group and Gates Industrial Corp. The e-business service focuses on information and business services for authorized distributors in the Process Industries segment.
Timken has entered into individually negotiated contracts with some of its customers. These contracts may extend for one or more years and, if a price is fixed for any period extending beyond current shipments, customarily include a commitment by the customer to purchase a designated percentage of its requirements from Timken. Timken does not believe that there is any significant loss of earnings risk associated with any given contract.
Competition:
The anti-friction bearing business is highly competitive in every country where Timken sells products. Timken primarily competes based on total value, including price, quality, timeliness of delivery, product design and the ability to provide engineering support and service on a global basis. The Company competes with domestic manufacturers and many foreign manufacturers of anti-friction bearings, including SKF Group, Schaeffler Group, NTN Corporation, JTEKT Corporation and NSK Ltd.
Joint Ventures:
Investments in affiliated companies accounted for under the equity method were approximately $2.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The investment balance at December 31, 2018 was reported in other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Backlog:
The following table provides the backlog of orders for the Company's domestic and overseas operations at December 31, 2018 and 2017: 

 | December 31,
(Dollars in millions) | 2018 | 2017 
Segment: | | 
Mobile Industries | $ | 955.0 | | $ | 882.3 
Process Industries | 699.3 | | 588.3 | 
Total Company | $ | 1,654.3 | | $ | 1,470.6

Approximately 90% of the Company’s backlog at December 31, 2018 is scheduled for delivery in the succeeding 12 months. Actual shipments depend upon customers' ever-changing production schedules. Accordingly, Timken does not believe that its backlog data and comparisons thereof, as of different dates, reliably indicate future sales or shipments.
Raw Materials:
The principal raw materials used by the Company to make engineered bearings are special bar quality ("SBQ") steel and steel components. SBQ steel and steel components are produced around the world by various suppliers. SBQ steel is purchased in bar, tube and wire forms, while steel components are commonly purchased as forgings, semi-finished or finished components. The primary inputs to SBQ steel include scrap metal, iron ore, alloys, energy and labor. The availability and price of SBQ steel are subject to changes in supply and demand, commodity prices for ferrous scrap, ore, alloy, electricity, natural gas, transportation fuel, and labor costs. The Company manages price variability of commodities by using surcharge mechanisms on some of its contracts with its customers that provides for partial recovery of these cost increases in the price of bearing products.
The availability of bearing-quality tubing is relatively limited, and the Company has taken steps to limit its exposure to this particular form of SBQ steel. Overall, the Company believes that the number of suppliers of SBQ steel is adequate to support the needs of global bearing production, and, in general, the Company is not dependent on any single source of supply.
Research:
Timken operates a network of technology and engineering centers to support its global customers with sites in North America, Europe and Asia. This network develops and delivers innovative friction management and power transmission solutions and technical services. Timken's largest technical center is located at the Company's world headquarters in North Canton, Ohio. Other sites in the United States include Los Alamitos, California; Manchester, Connecticut; Downer's Grove and Fulton, Illinois; Rochester Hills and Traverse City, Michigan; Springfield, Missouri; Keene and Lebanon, New Hampshire; and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. Within Europe, the Company has technology facilities in Plymouth, England; Colmar, France; Werdohl, Germany; Valmadrera, Italy; Gorinchem, Netherlands; and Ploiesti, Romania. In Asia, Timken operates technology and engineering facilities in Bangalore, India and Shanghai, China.
Expenditures for research and development amounted to approximately $37.3 million, $35.3 million and $31.8 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No amounts were funded by others in 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Environmental Matters:
The Company continues its efforts to protect the environment and comply with environmental protection laws. Additionally, it has invested in pollution control equipment and updated plant operational practices. The Company is committed to implementing a documented environmental management system worldwide and to becoming certified under the ISO 14001 standard where appropriate to meet or exceed customer requirements. As of the end of 2018, 18 of the Company’s plants had obtained ISO 14001 certification.
The Company establishes appropriate levels of reserves to cover its environmental expenses and has a well-established environmental compliance audit program for its domestic and international units. This program measures performance against applicable laws, as well as against internal standards that have been established for all units worldwide. It is difficult to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements that differ from existing requirements.

The Company and certain of its United States ("U.S.") subsidiaries previously have been and could in the future be identified as potentially responsible parties for investigation and remediation at off-site disposal or recycling facilities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), known as the Superfund, or state laws similar to CERCLA. In general, such claims for investigation and remediation also have been asserted against numerous other entities.
Management believes any ultimate liability with respect to pending actions will not materially affect the Company’s operations, cash flows or consolidated financial position. The Company also is conducting environmental investigation and/or remediation activities at certain current or former operating sites. The costs of such investigation and remediation activities, in the aggregate, are not expected to be material to the operations or financial position of the Company.
New laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements may require Timken to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses:
Timken owns numerous U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and licenses relating to certain products. While Timken regards these as important, it does not deem its business as a whole, or any industry segment, to be materially dependent upon any one item or group of items.
Employment:
At December 31, 2018, Timken had more than 17,000 employees worldwide. Approximately 7.6% of Timken’s U.S. employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements.
