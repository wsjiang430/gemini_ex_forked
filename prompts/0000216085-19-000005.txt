ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 
Unless otherwise indicated by the context, we use the terms “Havertys," "we," "our," or "us" when referring to the consolidated operations of Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc.
 
Overview
 
Havertys is a specialty retailer of residential furniture and accessories. Our founder, J.J. Haverty began the business in 1885 in Atlanta, Georgia with one store and made deliveries using horse-drawn wagons. The Company grew to 18 stores and was incorporated in September 1929. Anticipating further growth, the Company accessed additional capital through its initial public offering in October 1929.
 
Havertys has grown to 120 stores in 16 states in the Southern and Midwest regions. All of our retail locations are operated using the Havertys name and we do not franchise our stores. Our customers are generally college educated women in middle to upper-middle income households. Our brand recognition is very high in the markets we serve, and consumer surveys indicate Havertys is associated with a high level of quality, fashion, value and service.
 
Merchandise and Revenues
 
We develop our merchandise selection with the tastes of the diverse “on trend” consumer in mind. A wide range of styles from traditional to contemporary are in our core assortment and most of the furniture merchandise we carry bears the Havertys brand. We also tailor our product offerings to the needs and tastes of the local markets we serve emphasizing more “coastal,” “western” or “urban” looks as appropriate. Our custom upholstery programs and eclectic looks are an important part of our product mix and allow the on-trend consumer more self-expression.
 
We have avoided offering lower quality, promotional price-driven merchandise favored by many regional and national chains, which we believe would devalue the Havertys brand with the consumer. We carry nationally well-known mattress product lines such as Sealy®, Tempur-Pedic®, Serta®, Stearns & Foster®, and Beautyrest Black® in addition to our private label SkyeTM.
 
Our customers use varying methods to purchase or finance their sales. As an added convenience to our customers, we offer financing by third-party finance companies or through an internal revolving charge credit plan. Sales financed by the third-party providers are not Havertys’ receivables; accordingly, we do not have any credit risk or servicing responsibility for these accounts, and there is no credit or collection recourse to Havertys. The most popular programs offered through the third-party providers for 2018 were no interest offers requiring monthly payments over periods of 18 to 36 months. The fees we pay to the third-party are included in SG&A as a selling expense. We also maintain a small in-house financing program for our customers with the offer most frequently chosen carrying no interest for 12 months and requiring equal monthly payments. This program generates very minor credit revenue and is for credit worthy customers who prefer financing with the retailer directly or who are not able to quickly establish sufficient credit with other providers on comparable terms.
 
The following summarizes the different purchasing methods used as a percent of amount due from customers including sales tax:

Stores
 
As of December 31, 2018, we operated 120 stores serving 83 cities in 16 states with approximately 4.4 million retail square feet. Our stores range in size from 19,000 to 66,000 selling square feet with the average being approximately 35,000 square feet. We strive to have our stores reflect the distinctive style and comfort consumers expect to find when purchasing their home furnishings. The store’s curb appeal is important to the type of middle to upper-middle income consumer that we target and our use of classical facades and attractive landscaping complements the quality and style of our merchandise. Interior details are also important for a pleasant and inviting shopping experience. We are very intentional in having open shopping spaces and our disciplined merchandise display ensures uniformity of presentations in-store, online and in our advertising.
 
We currently have no plans to expand outside our distribution footprint and there are a limited number of markets that we do not currently serve that are expansion candidates.  We are evaluating certain existing stores for relocation. We expect a slight increase of approximately 2.0% in our retail square footage in 2019.
 
Internet
 
We consider our website an extension of our brick-and-mortar locations and not a separate segment of our business. Most customers will use the internet for inspiration and as a start to their shopping process to view products and prices. Our website features a variety of helpful tools including a design center with 3D room planners, upholstery customization, and inspired accessories to create shareable “Idea Boards.” A large number of product reviews written by our customers is also provided which some consumers find important in the decision-making process.
 
The next stop in the purchase journey for most consumers is a visit to a store to touch, sit, and see merchandise in person. Our sales consultants also use havertys.com as a tool to further engage our customers while they are in the store. They may make their purchase in the store or opt to return home and finalize their decisions, place their orders online and set delivery. We limit online sales of our furniture to within our delivery network, and accessories to the continental United States. Our online sales for 2018 were approximately 2% of our total sales and the level of online sales increased 10.9%.
 
We believe that a direct-to-customer business complements our retail store operations by building brand awareness.
 
Suppliers
 
We buy our merchandise from numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers, the largest ten of which accounted for approximately 51% of our product purchases during 2018. Most of our wood products, or “case goods,” are imported from Asia. Upholstered items are largely produced domestically, with the exception of our leather products which are primarily imported from Asia or Mexico.
 
We purchase our furniture merchandise produced in Asia through sourcing companies and also buy direct from manufacturers. Our direct import team works with industry designers and manufacturers in some of the best factories throughout Asia. We have dedicated quality control specialists on-site during production to ensure the items meet our specifications. Approximately 30% of our case goods sales in 2018 were generated by our direct imports.
 
Supply Chain and Distribution
 
The longer lead times required for deliveries from overseas factories and the production of merchandise exclusively for Havertys makes it imperative for us to have both warehousing capabilities and end-to-end supply chain visibility. Our merchandising team provides input to the automated procurement process in an effort to maintain overall inventory levels within an appropriate range and reduce the amount of written sales awaiting product delivery. We use real-time information to closely follow our import orders from the manufacturing plant through each stage of transit and using this data can more accurately set customer delivery dates prior to receipt of product.

Our distribution system uses a combination of three distribution centers (DCs) and four home delivery centers (HDCs). The DCs receive both domestic product and containers of imported merchandise. A warehousing management system using radio frequency scanners tracks each piece of inventory in real time and allows for random storage in the warehouse and efficient scheduling and changing of the workflow. The DCs are also designed to shuttle prepped merchandise up to 250 miles for next day home deliveries and serve HDCs within a 500-mile radius. The HDCs provide service to markets within an additional 200 miles. We use a third-party to handle over-the-road delivery of product from the DCs to the HDCs and market areas. We use Havertys employees for executing home delivery, and branded this service “Top Drawer Delivery,” an important function serving as the last contact with our customers in the purchase process. Operating standards in our warehouse and delivery functions provide measurements for determining staffing needs and increasing productivity. We believe that our distribution and delivery system is one of the best in the retail furniture industry and provides us with a significant competitive advantage.

Competition
 
The retail sale of home furnishings is a highly fragmented and competitive business. The degree and sources of competition vary by geographic area. We compete with numerous individual retail furniture stores as well as chains. Retail stores opened by furniture manufacturers in an effort to control and protect the distribution prospects of their branded merchandise compete with us in certain markets.  Mass merchants, certain department stores, and some electronics and appliance retailers also have limited furniture product offerings. There has been growth in the e‑commerce channel both from internet only retailers and those with a brick-and-mortar presence.
 
We believe Havertys is uniquely positioned in the marketplace, with a targeted mix of merchandise that appeals to customers who are somewhat more affluent than those of promotional price-oriented furniture stores. Our online presence provides most elements of a seamless omni-channel approach that many of our competitors do not have or cannot replicate. We consider the expansion of our custom order capabilities, free in-home design service, the tailoring of merchandise on a local market basis, and the ability to make prompt delivery of orders through maintenance of inventory, significant competitive advantages.
 
Employees
 
Our employees are among our best investments and are critical for our success. As of December 31, 2018, we had 3,418 employees: 2,102 in individual retail store operations, 196 in our corporate and credit operations, 70 in our customer-service call centers, and 1,050 in our warehouse and delivery points. None of our employees is a party to any union contract.

Seasonality
 
Our business is affected by traditional retail seasonality, advertising and promotion programs, and general economic trends.  We typically achieve our smallest quarter by revenues in the second quarter and the largest in the fourth quarter.  In 2018, our fourth quarter sales did not match historical patterns as business surrounding the traditional holiday shopping periods around Thanksgiving and Christmas was significantly lower than in the prior years.
Trademarks and Domain Names
 
We have registered our various logos, trademarks and service marks. We believe that our trademark position is adequately protected in all markets in which we do business. In addition, we have registered and maintain numerous internet domain names including “havertys.com.” Collectively, the logos, trademarks, service marks and domain names that we hold are of material importance to us.
