ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Our Company
Except where the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company,” the “Company” or “Veritex” refer to Veritex Holdings, Inc. and our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Veritex Community Bank, and the terms “Bank” or “Veritex Bank” refer to Veritex Community Bank.
Veritex Holdings, Inc. is a Texas corporation and bank holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Veritex Community Bank, a Texas state chartered bank, we provide relationship-driven commercial banking products and services tailored to meet the needs of small to medium-sized businesses and professionals. Beginning at our inception in 2010, we initially targeted customers and focused our acquisitions primarily in the Dallas metropolitan area, which we consider to be Dallas and the adjacent communities in North Dallas. Our current primary market now includes the broader Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and the Houston metropolitan area. As we continue to grow, we may expand to other metropolitan banking markets in Texas.
On January 1, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Green Bancorp, Inc. (“Green”), the parent holding company of Green Bank, N.A. (“Green Bank”), a national banking association headquartered in Houston, Texas with 21 full-services branches in the Houston, Dallas and other markets. Under the terms of the definitive agreement for the acquisition, each outstanding share of Green common stock, Green restricted stock units subject to acceleration vesting upon change in control and Green options exchanged subject to accelerated vesting upon change in control was converted into the right to receive 0.79 shares of our common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock. In connection with the definitive agreement, Green was merged with and into Veritex, with Veritex continuing as the surviving corporation and immediately thereafter, Green Bank was merged with and into Veritex Bank, with Veritex Bank continuing as the surviving bank. Additionally, certain executive officers and a number of other key employees of Green have entered into employment agreements with us, which provide for certain compensatory arrangements and severance entitlements upon an involuntary termination following the closing date of the acquisition. Our primary reason for the transaction was to further solidify our market share in the Texas market. 
After completing the Green acquisition, Veritex became one of the ten largest banks headquartered in Texas. Veritex Bank now has 43 full-service branch locations in Texas, with a concentration in the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston metroplexes.
Our business is conducted through one reportable segment, community banking, where we generate the majority of our revenues from interest income on loans, customer service and loan fees, gains on sale of Small Business Administration (“SBA”) guaranteed loans and mortgage loans and interest income from securities. We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds and noninterest expense, such as salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses. We analyze our ability to maximize income generated from interest-earning assets and expense of our liabilities through our net interest margin. Net interest margin is a ratio calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets.
Our primary customers are small and medium-sized businesses, generally with annual revenues of under $30 million, and professionals. We believe that these businesses and professionals highly value the local decision-making and relationship-driven, quality service we provide and our deep, long-term understanding of Texas community banking. As a result of consolidation, we believe that few locally-based banks are dedicated to providing this level of service to small and medium-sized businesses and professionals. Our management team’s long-standing presence and experience in Texas gives us unique insight into local market opportunities and the needs of our customers. This enables us to respond quickly to customers, provide high quality personal service and develop comprehensive, long-term banking relationships by providing products and services tailored to meet the individual needs of our customers. This focus and approach enhances our ability to continue to grow organically, successfully recruit talented bankers and strategically source potential acquisitions in our target markets.
We completed an initial public offering of our common stock in October 2014 as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As of June 30, 2018, the aggregate worldwide market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates exceeded the market value required to maintain emerging growth company status. As a result, beginning on January 1, 2019, we are no longer considered an emerging growth company. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “VBTX.”

Our History and Growth
We have experienced significant growth since commencing banking operations in 2010 through our strategy of pursuing organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Since inception, we have completed seven whole-bank acquisitions that increased our market presence within the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, including an acquisition that resulted in us entering the Houston metropolitan market in 2017. On August 1, 2017, we acquired Sovereign Bancshares, Inc. (“Sovereign”), a Texas corporation and the parent company of Sovereign Bank. On December 1, 2017, we acquired Liberty Bancshares, Inc. (“Liberty”), a Texas corporation and the parent company of Liberty Bank. Upon the completion of the Sovereign acquisition, in order to focus our growth efforts in the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston markets, we made the strategic decision to exit the Austin market. On January 1, 2018, we completed the sale of two Austin branches acquired as part of the Sovereign acquisition. These branches were classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017. The completion of this branch sale resulted in our fully exiting the Austin market. As further discussed above, on January 1, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Green, a Texas corporation and the parent holding company of Green Bank. For further information, see Note 28 - Subsequent Events in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. After completing the Green acquisition, Veritex became one of the ten largest banks headquartered in Texas.
Our management team is led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, C. Malcolm Holland, III, who has overseen and managed our organic growth and acquisition activity since we commenced banking operations.
The following table summarizes our seven completed acquisitions since inception through December 31, 2018:

 | Date | Number of | 
 | Completed | Branches | Locations
Bank Acquired | | | 
Professional Bank, N.A. through Professional Capital, Inc. | September 2010 | 3 | | Park Cities, Lakewood and Garland 
Fidelity Bank through Fidelity Resources Company | March 2011 | 3 | | Preston Center, SMU and Plano 
Bank of Las Colinas | October 2011 | 1 | | Las Colinas 
Independent Bank of Texas through IBT Bancorp, Inc. | July 2015 | 2 | | Irving and Frisco 
Sovereign Bank through Sovereign Bancshares, Inc. | August 2017 | 9 | | Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and Austin(1)
Liberty Bank through Liberty Bancshares, Inc. | December 2017 | 5 | | Fort Worth 
Green Bank through Green Bancorp, Inc. | January 2019 | 21 | | Houston and Dallas 

(1) Upon the completion of the Sovereign acquisition, in order to focus our growth efforts in the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston markets, we made the strategic decision to exit the Austin market. On January 1, 2018, we completed the sale of two Austin branches acquired as part of the Sovereign acquisition. These branches were classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017. The completion of this branch sale resulted in our fully exiting the Austin market.
Our Strategy
Our business strategy consists of the following components:

• | Continued Organic Growth. Our organic growth strategy focuses on penetrating our markets through our community-focused, relationship-driven approach to banking. We believe that our current market area provides abundant opportunities to continue to grow our customer base, increase loans and deposits and expand our overall market share. Our team of seasoned bankers is an important driver of our organic growth by virtue of its role in further developing banking relationships with current and potential customers, many of which span more than 20 years. Our market presidents and relationship managers are incentivized to increase the size of their loan and deposit portfolios and generate fee income while maintaining strong credit quality. We expect to have continued success adding to our team of experienced bankers in order to grow our market presence. Also, preserving sound credit underwriting standards as we grow our loan portfolio will continue to be the foundation of our organic growth strategy. 


• | Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We intend to continue to grow through acquisitions. We believe there are banking organizations in our market area that face significant scale and operational challenges, regulatory pressure, management succession issues and shareholder liquidity needs, which we believe will present attractive acquisition opportunities for us in the future. We believe we have developed an experienced and disciplined acquisition and integration approach capable of identifying candidates, conducting thorough due diligence, determining financial attractiveness and 

3

integrating the acquired institution. Utilizing our management team’s experience of acquiring financial institutions, we believe that we have built a corporate infrastructure capable of supporting additional acquisitions and continued organic growth. We believe our acquisition experience and our reputation as a successful acquirer position us to capitalize on potential additional opportunities in the future. 

• | Improve Operational Efficiency and Increase Profitability. We are committed to maintaining and enhancing profitability. We employ a systematic and calculated approach to improving our operational efficiency, which in turn, we believe, increases our profitability. We believe that our scalable infrastructure and efficient operating platform will allow us to achieve continued growth without incurring significant incremental noninterest expenses and will enhance our returns. 


• | Strengthen Our Community Ties. Our officers and employees are heavily involved in civic and community organizations, and we sponsor numerous activities that benefit our community. Our business development strategy, which focuses on building market share through personal relationships, as opposed to formal advertising, is consistent with our customer-centric culture and is a cost-effective approach to developing new relationships and enhancing existing ones. 

Our Banking Services
We focus on delivering a wide variety of relationship-driven commercial banking products and services tailored to meet the needs of small to medium-sized businesses and professionals. A general discussion of the range of commercial banking products and other services we offer follows.
Lending Activities. As of December 31, 2018, loans totaled $2.6 billion, representing 79.6% of our total assets. Our loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate and general commercial loans, residential real estate loans, construction and land loans, farmland loans and consumer loans.
Our underwriting philosophy seeks to balance our desire to make sound, high quality loans while recognizing that lending money involves a degree of business risk. Managing credit risk is a company-wide process. Our strategy for credit risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria by loan type and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all types of credit exposures. Our processes emphasize early-stage review of loans, regular credit evaluations and management reviews of loans, which supplement the ongoing and proactive credit monitoring and loan servicing provided by our loan officers and lending support staff. Our Executive Loan Committee and Directors’ Loan Committee provide company-wide credit oversight and periodically review all credit risk portfolios to ensure that the risk identification processes are functioning properly and that our credit standards are followed. In addition, a third-party loan review is performed at least annually to identify problem assets and confirm our internal risk rating of loans. We attempt to identify potential problem loans early in an effort to aggressively seek resolution of these situations before the loans become a loss, record any necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain adequate allowance levels for probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio.
Deposits. Deposits are our principal source of funds for our interest-earning assets. We believe that a critical component of our success is the importance we place on our deposit services. Our services include typical deposit functions of commercial banks, safe deposit facilities and commercial and personal banking services, in addition to our loan offerings. We offer a variety of deposit products and services consistent with the goal of attracting a wide variety of customers, including high net worth individuals and small to medium-sized businesses. We offer demand, savings, money market and time deposit accounts. We actively pursue business checking accounts by offering competitive rates, telephone banking, online banking and other convenient services to our customers. We also pursue commercial deposit and financial institution money market accounts that will benefit from the utilization of our treasury management services.
Other Products and Services. We offer banking products and services that are attractively priced and we believe easily understood by customers, with a focus on convenience and accessibility. We offer a full suite of online banking solutions including access to account balances, online transfers, online bill payment and electronic delivery of customer statements, as well as ATMs, and banking by telephone, mail and personal appointment. We also offer debit cards, night depository, direct deposit, cashier’s checks and letters of credit.
We offer a full array of commercial treasury management services designed to be competitive with banks of all sizes. Treasury management services include balance reporting (including current day and previous day activity), transfers between accounts, wire transfer initiation, automated clearinghouse origination and stop payments. Cash management deposit products consist of lockbox, remote deposit capture, positive pay, reverse positive pay, account reconciliation services, zero balance accounts and sweep accounts, including loan sweep.

Investments
The primary objectives of our investment policy are to provide a source of liquidity, to provide an appropriate return on funds invested, to manage interest rate risk, to meet pledging requirements and to meet regulatory capital requirements.  As of December 31, 2018, the book value of our investment portfolio totaled $262.7 million, with an average yield of 2.67% and an estimated effective duration of approximately 3.19 years.
Our Market Area
We currently operate in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and the Houston metropolitan area. The economy in these areas is fueled by the real estate, technology, financial services, insurance, transportation, manufacturing, health care and energy sectors. These market areas are among the most vibrant in the United States with rapidly growing populations, a high level of job growth, an affordable cost of living and a pro-growth business climate. 
Competition
The Texas market for banking services is highly competitive. Texas’ largest banking organizations are headquartered outside of Texas and are controlled by organizations outside the state. We compete with numerous commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and nationally, and more recently with financial technology companies that rely on technology to provide financial services. We believe that many small to medium-sized businesses and professionals are interested in banking with a company headquartered in, and with decision-making authority based in, Texas. We also believe these customers seek established Texas bankers who have the expertise to act as trusted advisors regarding their banking needs. We believe Veritex can offer customers more responsive and personalized service. We also believe that, if we service these customers properly, we will be able to establish long-term relationships and provide multiple products to our customers, thereby enhancing our profitability. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Veritex’s Business - Veritex faces strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.” in Item 1A of this report. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 327 full-time employees and three part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a union. In August 2018, the Bank was named one of the “Best Banks to Work For 2018” by the American Banker. We strive to maintain a culture where people are rewarded for hard work and share in the benefits of the success of the Company.
Our Corporate Information
Our principal executive offices are located at 8214 Westchester Drive, Suite 800, Dallas, Texas 75225, and our telephone number is (972) 349-6200. Our website is www.veritexbank.com. We make available at this address, free of charge, our annual report on Form 10-K, our annual reports to shareholders, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. These documents are also available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. The information contained on or accessible from our website does not constitute a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated by reference herein.
Regulation and Supervision
The U.S. banking industry is highly regulated under federal and state law. These laws and regulations affect the operations and performance of the Company and its subsidiaries and are intended primarily for the protection of the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), the bank’s depositors and the public, rather than our shareholders or creditors.
Statutes, regulations and policies limit the activities in which the Company may engage and how it conducts certain permitted activities. Further, the bank regulatory system imposes reporting and information collection obligations. The Company incurs significant costs relating to compliance with these laws and regulations. Banking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies, and a change in them, including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
5

The material statutory and regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries are summarized below. The description below is not intended to summarize all laws and regulations applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, and is based upon the statutes, regulations, policies, interpretive letters and other written guidance that are in effect as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Bank and Bank Holding Company Regulation
The Bank is a Texas-chartered banking association, the deposits of which are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC up to applicable legal limits. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System; therefore, the Bank is subject to ongoing and comprehensive supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the Texas Department of Banking (the “TDB”) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”).
A company that acquires ownership or control of 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, that controls the election of a majority of the board of directors of such an institution, or that exercises a controlling influence over the affairs of such an institution is a bank holding company and must obtain the prior approval of and later register with the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). A company that acquires less than 25% but more than 5% of a class of voting securities may be required to enter into passivity commitments with the Federal Reserve. Bank holding companies are subject to regulation, examination, supervision and enforcement by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. The Federal Reserve’s jurisdiction also extends to any company that is directly or indirectly controlled by a bank holding company.
As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to ongoing and comprehensive supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the Federal Reserve. As a bank holding company of a Texas state chartered bank, the Company is also subject to supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the TDB.
Broad Supervision, Examination and Enforcement Powers
A principal objective of the U.S. bank regulatory system is to protect depositors by ensuring the financial safety and soundness of banking organizations. To that end, the banking regulators have broad regulatory, examination and enforcement authority. The regulators regularly examine the operations of banking organizations. In addition, banking organizations are subject to periodic reporting requirements. Insured depository institutions with total assets of $500 million or more must submit annual audit reports prepared by independent auditors to federal and state regulators. In some instances, the audit report of the insured depository institution’s bank holding company can be used to satisfy this requirement. Auditors must receive examination reports, supervisory agreements and reports of enforcement actions.
The regulators have various remedies available if they determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of a banking organization’s operations are unsatisfactory. The regulators may also take action if they determine that the banking organization or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation. The regulators have the power to, among other things:

• | require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice;


• | issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced;


• | direct increases in capital;


• | direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets;


• | limit dividends and distributions;


• | restrict growth;


• | assess civil monetary penalties;


• | remove officers and directors; and


• | terminate deposit insurance

Engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or failing to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory agreements could subject us and our subsidiaries or their officers, directors and institution-affiliated parties to the remedies described above and other sanctions. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Veritex’s Industry and Regulation”.
The Dodd-Frank Act and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform, and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”)
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed significant regulatory and compliance requirements, including the designation of certain financial companies as systemically important financial companies, enhanced oversight of credit rating agencies, the imposition of increased capital, leverage and liquidity requirements, and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthen safety and soundness within, the financial services sector.
Various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may affect our business and include, but may not be limited to the following: 

• | Source of strength. Under Federal Reserve policy, bank holding companies have historically been required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of their banking subsidiaries, and the Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. As a result of this requirement, in the future we could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should it experience financial distress and in circumstances in which we might not otherwise do so. 


• | Mortgage loan origination. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay a residential mortgage loan. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, financial institutions may not make a residential mortgage loan unless it makes a “reasonable and good faith determination” that the consumer has a “reasonable ability” to repay the loan. The Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure but provides a full or partial safe harbor from such defenses for loans that are “qualified mortgages.” The CFPB has promulgated final rules to, among other things, specify the types of income and assets that may be considered in the ability to repay determination, the permissible sources for verification and the required methods of calculating the loan’s monthly payments. The rules extend the requirement that creditors verify and document a borrower’s income and assets to include all information that creditors rely on in determining repayment ability. The rules also provide further examples of third party documents that may be relied on for such verification, such as government records and check cashing or funds transfer service receipts. The rules set conditions for “qualified mortgages,” including underwriting standards (for example, a borrower’s debt to income ratio may not exceed 43%) and limits on the terms of their loans. Points and fees are subject to a relatively stringent cap, and are defined to include a wide array of payments that may be made in the course of closing a loan. Certain loans, including interest only loans and negative amortization loans, cannot be qualified mortgages. EGRRCPA modifies certain of these requirements by, among other things, creating a safe harbor from the ability-to-repay standards for certain mortgage loans made by a bank with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets.


• | Risk retention. The Federal Reserve, together with the FDIC, the SEC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a final rule in 2014 to implement the risk retention requirement mandated by Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The risk retention requirement generally requires a securitizer to retain no less than 5% of the credit risk in assets it sells into a securitization and prohibits a securitizer from directly or indirectly hedging or otherwise transferring the credit risk that the securitizer is required to retain, subject to limited exemptions. One significant exemption is for securities entirely collateralized by “qualified residential mortgages” (“QRMs”), which are loans deemed to have a lower risk of default. The rule defines QRMs to have the same meaning as the term “qualified mortgage,” as defined by the CFPB. In addition, the rule provides for reduced risk retention requirements for qualifying securitizations of commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and auto loans.


• | Imposition of restrictions on swaps activities. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes a new regulatory structure on the over-the-counter derivatives market, including requirements for clearing, exchange trading, capital, margin, reporting and record keeping. This framework covers any person required to register as a “major swap participant,” “swap dealer,” “major security-based swap participant” or a “security-based swap dealer.” We are treated as an end user and are not subject directly to many of these requirements, but the requirements may affect the nature of the business we conduct with persons required to register. 

7


• | Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services offered to bank and thrift consumers. For banking organizations with assets of $10 billion or more, the CFPB has exclusive rule-making, examination, and primary enforcement authority under federal consumer financial laws. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB. Compliance with any such new regulations would increase our cost of operations. The change in leadership at the CFPB in 2017, the release of a new strategic plan and the publication of formal requests for information on possible changes to its general supervisory program and its enforcement program suggest that the CFPB may be taking a different approach to its implementation of consumer financial protection laws than the agency did when it first began operations, but we are unable to predict what effect, if any, these changes may have on the Bank. 


• | Deposit insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the general $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits. Amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”) also revised the assessment base against which an insured depository institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund will be calculated. Under the amendments, the assessment base is no longer the institution’s deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act made changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. For a discussion of the assessments the Bank pays to the FDIC, see “Deposit Insurance and Deposit Insurance Assessments” below.


• | Transactions with affiliates and insiders. The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and clarification regarding the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. Insider transaction limitations were expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits, including derivatives transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions.


• | Corporate governance. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protections, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies, including the Company. The Dodd-Frank Act: (i) grants shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation, (ii) enhances independence requirements for compensation committee members, (iii) requires companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt incentive-based compensation clawback policies for executive officers and (iv) provides the SEC with authority to adopt proxy access rules that would allow shareholders of publicly traded companies to nominate candidates for election as a director and have those nominees included in a company’s proxy materials. For so long as we were an emerging growth company, we took advantage of the provisions of the JOBS Act, that allowed us to not seek a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. Since we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will need to seek these non-binding advisory votes at our next annual meeting of shareholders.

In May 2018, EGRRCPA was signed into law. While EGRRCPA preserves the fundamental elements of the post Dodd-Frank regulatory framework, it includes modifications that are intended to result in meaningful regulatory relief both from certain Dodd-Frank provisions and from certain regulatory capital rules for smaller and certain regional banking organizations. Among other things, EGRRCPA exempts us from the Volcker Rule, allows us to avoid the risk-based capital rules if we maintain a specific “community bank leverage ratio,” revises the capital treatment of certain commercial real estate loans, and amends certain Truth in Lending Act requirements for residential mortgage loans.
The Volcker Rule
Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, popularly known as the “Volcker Rule,” generally prohibits “banking entities” from engaging in “proprietary trading” and making investments and conducting certain other activities with private equity funds and hedge funds. These prohibitions apply to banking entities of any size, including us and the Bank. In 2013, the Federal Reserve, together with the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Current (the “OCC”), the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, issued regulations to implement the Volcker Rule. EGRRCPA exempts banks with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or less from the Volcker Rule. This exemption took effect upon enactment. The statute did not formally exempt bank holding companies under the $10 billion threshold from the Volcker Rule, but the federal banking agencies have pledged not to enforce it 
8

against these companies. Although we do not believe we engaged in any activities covered by the Volcker Rule, the exemption eliminates any need for a compliance program. We have reviewed the scope of the Volcker Rule and have determined that we do not have any activities or investments that are subject to the requirements of the rule at this time.
Notice and Approval Requirements Related to Control
Federal and state banking laws impose notice, application, approval or non-objection and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other person that controls or seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution. In addition to requirements that may apply under the BHC Act, described above under “Bank and Bank Holding Company Regulation,” the Change in Bank Control Act and the Texas Banking Act require regulatory filings by a shareholder or other person that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution. The determination of whether a person “controls” a depository institution or its holding company is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment. As a general matter, a person is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the person owns or controls 25% or more of any class of voting stock. Subject to rebuttal, a person is presumed to control a depository institution or other company if the person owns or controls 10% or more of any class of voting stock and other regulatory criteria are met. The holdings of certain affiliated persons, or persons acting in concert, are typically aggregated for the purpose of applying the 10% and 25% thresholds.
In addition, except under limited circumstances, bank holding companies are prohibited from acquiring, without prior approval, control of any other bank or bank holding company or all or substantially all the assets thereof; or more than 5% of the voting shares of a bank or bank holding company that is not already a subsidiary.
Permissible Activities and Investments
Banking laws generally restrict our ability to engage in, or acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of a company engaged in, activities other than those determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”) expanded the scope of permissible activities to include those that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity for a bank holding company that elects to be a financial holding company, which requires the satisfaction of certain conditions. We have not elected financial holding company status.
In addition, as a general matter, we must receive prior regulatory approval before establishing or acquiring a depository institution or, in certain cases, a non-bank entity.
The Texas Constitution, as amended in 1986, provides that a Texas-chartered bank has the same rights and privileges that are or may be granted to national banks domiciled in Texas. To the extent that the Texas laws and regulations may have allowed state-chartered banks to engage in a broader range of activities than national banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) has operated to limit such activities. FDICIA provides that no state bank or subsidiary thereof may engage as a principal in any activity in which national banks are not permitted to engage, unless the institution complies with applicable capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity poses no significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. In general, statutory restrictions on the activities of banks are aimed at protecting the safety and soundness of depository institutions.
Branching
Texas law provides that a Texas-chartered bank can establish a branch anywhere in Texas provided that the branch is approved in advance by the TDB. The branch must also be approved by the Federal Reserve.  The regulators consider a number of factors, including financial history, capital adequacy, earnings prospects, character of management, needs of the community and consistency with corporate powers. The Dodd-Frank Act permits insured state banks to engage in de novo interstate branching if the laws of the state where the new branch is to be established would permit the establishment of the branch if it were chartered by such state.
Regulatory Capital Requirements and Capital Adequacy
The bank regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution’s financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. The final supervisory determination on an institution’s capital adequacy is based on the regulator’s assessment of numerous factors.  As a bank holding company and a state-chartered member bank, we and the Bank are subject to several regulatory capital requirements.
9

Capital requirements have evolved over the last 30 years. The current requirement took effect on January 1, 2015, with phase-in periods for certain requirements; as of January 9, 2019, all of the requirements were fully phased in. The requirements are based on a set of international standards popularly known as Basel III. By virtue of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company is broadly subject to the same requirements that apply to the Bank. 
Under the current capital rules, the Bank must maintain “tangible” capital equal to 1.5% of average total assets, common equity Tier 1 equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital equal to 6% of risk-weighted assets, total capital (a combination of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) equal to 8% of risk-weighted assets, and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets equal to 4%. The regulations also modified the thresholds necessary for a savings association to be deemed well or adequately capitalized; these adjustments are discussed below under “Prompt Corrective Action.”
Under the rules, the components of common equity Tier 1 capital include common stock instruments (including related surplus), retained earnings, and certain minority interests in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries (subject to certain limitations). A bank must make certain deductions from and adjustments to the sum of these components to determine common equity Tier 1 capital. The required deductions for banks include, among other items, goodwill (net of associated deferred tax liabilities), certain other intangible assets (net of deferred tax liabilities), certain deferred tax assets, gains on sale in connection with securitization exposures and investments in and extensions of credit to certain subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible for national banks. The adjustments require several complex calculations and include adjustments to the amounts of deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing assets, and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that are includable in common equity Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, and certain minority interests in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries not included in common equity Tier 1 capital, subject to certain limitations. Tier 2 capital includes subordinated debt with a minimum original maturity of five years, related surplus, certain minority interests in in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries not included in Tier 1 capital (subject to certain limitations), and limited amounts of a bank’s allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”). Certain deductions and adjustments are necessary for both additional Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tangible capital has the same definition as Tier 1 capital. Under the final rules, banking organizations were provided a one-time option in their initial regulatory financial report filed after January 1, 2015, to remove certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income from the computation of common equity regulatory capital.
The risk weights used for the risk-based capital calculations are 0% for cash, U.S. government securities, and certain other assets, 50% for qualifying residential mortgage exposures, 100% for corporate exposures and non-qualifying mortgage loans and certain other assets, and 600% for certain equity exposures. Loans that are past due by 90 days or more and commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans either with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of the supervisory ceilings or without a certain amount of contributed capital from the borrower must be risk-weighted at 150%. EGRRCPA narrowed the class of CRE loans subject to the 150% risk weight; CRE loans otherwise are risk weighted at 100%. Mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from common equity Tier 1 capital in accordance with the adjustment stated above are risk-weighted at 250%.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, total capital, tangible capital and leverage capital requirements. See Note 23 – Capital Requirements and Restrictions on Retained Earnings in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more details.
The Company is subject to similar minimum capital requirements as the Bank, except that the Company is not subject to a tangible capital ratio requirement. As a bank holding company with less than $15 billion in total assets, we may include certain existing trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock in regulatory capital while other instruments are disallowed. As of December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, total capital and leverage capital requirements. For the Company to be “well capitalized,” the Bank must be well capitalized and the Company must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of December 31, 2018, the Company met all the requirements to be deemed well-capitalized.
In addition, applicable rules subject a banking organization to certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the organization does not maintain a “capital conservation buffer” of common equity Tier 1 capital in an amount greater than 2.5% of its total risk-weighted assets. This requirement is still phasing in and took full effect on January 1, 2019. In 2018 the buffer was 1.875%. The effect of the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer is to increase the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio to 8.5% and the minimum total risk-based capital ratio to 10.5%, for banking organizations seeking to avoid the limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.
10

Banks (and bank holding companies) with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets may be exempt from the risk-based and leverage capital requirements as well as the capital conservation buffer if the federal banking agencies finalize a rule on the community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) and if the banks meet the requirements of the rule. EGRRCPA required the agencies to establish this ratio within a range of 8% to 10%. The agencies have proposed a rule with a 9% CBLR that would be available to banking firms under the $10 billion threshold provided that certain assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items were below certain ceilings.
These capital requirements are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations. The Federal Reserve (and the other federal bank regulatory agencies) may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant.  Federal Reserve guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.
Prompt Corrective Action
In addition to the capital rules, the Bank is subject to the “prompt corrective action” (“PCA”) regime. This regime subjects an insured depository institution to increasingly stringent restrictions and supervisory actions by its primary federal regulator, if the institution becomes undercapitalized and its financial condition continues to deteriorate. Each U.S. insured depository institution falls within one of five assigned capital categories: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” An insured depository institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and the institution is not subject to an order, written agreement, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure. A well-capitalized institution is not subject to any restrictions on its activities and enjoys certain regulatory advantages such as streamlined processing of many applications. A depository institution is deemed to be “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and does not meet the criteria for a “well capitalized” bank. Adequately-capitalized status is necessary in order to undertake a variety of regulated activities. An institution that is adequately capitalized but not well capitalized may be restricted in its ability to rely on brokered deposits, discussed further below under “Brokered Deposits.” The pending CBLR proposal would treat a bank that met the CBLR requirements as well capitalized without reference to any of the current PCA ratios.
A depository institution is “under capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%. A depository institution is “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 3.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is critically undercapitalized if its ratio of tangible equity to total assets is equal to or less than 2.0%. Significantly undercapitalized institutions are subject to a wider array of adverse agency actions than undercapitalized institutions. A critically undercapitalized institution is likely to be place in receivership if it does not find a merger partner. Under certain circumstances, an institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category.
A banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution provides a performance guarantee of the subsidiary’s compliance with the capital restoration plan up to the lesser of 5% of the bank’s total assets or the amount necessary to bring the bank into compliance with capital requirements as of the time it fell out of compliance.
Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject an institution to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies, including termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, restrictions on certain business activities, and appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank met the requirements to be “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action regulations.

Regulatory Limits on Dividends and Distributions
As a bank holding company, we are subject to certain restrictions on paying dividends under applicable federal and Texas laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement that provides that a bank holding company should not pay dividends unless (i) its net income over the last four quarters (net of dividends paid) has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries and (iii) the bank holding company will continue to meet minimum required capital adequacy ratios. Accordingly, a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or that can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health, such as by borrowing. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes, and Basel III results in, additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends.
Substantially all of our income, and a principal source of our liquidity, are dividends from the Bank. Bank dividend activity is governed by federal and state laws, regulations and policies.
Capital adequacy requirements serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. Under Federal Reserve guidelines, the Bank may pay dividends to us only from net income and retained earnings and may not impair its permanent capital, subject to certain exceptions. Under the FDIA, an insured depository institution such as the Bank is prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become “undercapitalized.” The Federal Reserve may further restrict the payment of dividends by requiring the Bank to maintain a higher level of capital than would otherwise be required to be adequately capitalized for regulatory purposes. Payment of dividends by the Bank also may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the appropriate regulator if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice. As noted above, the capital conservation buffer created under the final capital rules, when fully implemented, may also have the effect of limiting the payment of capital distributions from the Bank.
On January 28, 2019, Veritex Holdings, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors declared the initiation of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share on our outstanding common stock. The dividend will be paid on or after February 21, 2019 to shareholders of record as of February 7, 2019. This is the first common stock dividend declared by the Board of Directors of the Company and reflects the strength of the Company's performance over the last fiscal year and the higher level of organic capital generation that resulted from the lower effective tax rates in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Reserve Requirements
Pursuant to regulations of the Federal Reserve, all banking organizations are required to maintain average daily reserves at mandated ratios against their transaction accounts. In addition, reserves must be maintained on certain non-personal time deposits. These reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in an account at a Federal Reserve Bank.
Limits on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
Insured depository institutions are subject to restrictions on their ability to conduct transactions with affiliates and other related parties. Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative limits, qualitative requirements, and collateral standards on certain transactions by an insured depository institution with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates. Transactions covered by Section 23A include loans, extensions of credit, investment in securities issued by an affiliate, and acquisitions of assets from an affiliate. Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act requires that most types of transactions by an insured depository institution with, or for the benefit of, an affiliate be on terms substantially the same or at least as favorable to the insured depository institution as if the transaction were conducted with an unaffiliated third party.
As noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and a clarification regarding the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. The ability of the Federal Reserve to grant exemptions from these restrictions is also narrowed by the Dodd-Frank Act, including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators.
The Federal Reserve’s Regulation O regulations impose restrictions and procedural requirements in connection with the extension of credit by an insured depository institution to directors, executive officers, principal shareholders and their related interests. Section 18(z) of the FDIA limits purchases and sales of assets between an insured depository institution and its executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders.
12

Brokered Deposits
The FDIA restricts the use of brokered deposits by certain depository institutions. A well capitalized insured depository institution may solicit and accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit without restriction. An adequately capitalized insured depository institution may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver of this prohibition by the FDIC. The FDIC may grant a waiver upon a finding that the acceptance of brokered deposits does not constitute an unsafe or unsound practice with respect to such institution. The rates that an adequately capitalized institution with a waiver may pay on brokered deposits may not exceed certain ceilings. An “undercapitalized insured depository institution” may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit. At December 31, 2018, the Company is considered a well capitalized insured depository institution with total brokered deposits of $234.2 million.
Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Guidance
The federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (i) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm residential properties and loans for construction, land development and other land represent 300% or more of total risk-based capital and the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are excluded from this second category. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. At December 31, 2018, total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represented over 100% of total capital, indicating a concentration in commercial real estate lending. At December 31, 2018, our management believes that it is in compliance with the requirements and guidance of federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve, for institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. 
Examination and Examination Fees
The Federal Reserve periodically examines and evaluates state member banks. Based on such an evaluation, the Bank, among other things, may be required to revalue its assets and establish specific reserves to compensate for the difference between the Bank’s assessment and that of the Federal Reserve. The TDB also conducts examinations of state banks but may accept the results of a federal examination in lieu of conducting an independent examination. In addition, the Federal Reserve and TDB may elect to conduct a joint examination. The TDB charges fees to recover the costs of examining Texas chartered banks, as well as filing fees for certain applications and other filings. The Dodd-Frank Act provides various agencies with the authority to assess additional supervision fees.
Deposit Insurance and Deposit Insurance Assessments
The Bank’s deposits are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, or DIF, to the maximum extent permitted by the FDIC. This amount is $250,000 per depositor per account. As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, insured institutions. The agency also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC. The FDIC has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings associations, after giving the OCC an opportunity to take such action.
Insured depository institutions fund the DIF through quarterly assessments. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based premium system to calculate the assessments. All institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2019.
The FDIC has revised its methodology for determining assessments from time to time. The current methodology, which has been in place since the third quarter of 2016, has a range of assessment rates from 3 basis points to 30 basis points on insured deposits. All insured depository institutions with the exception of large and complex banking organizations are assigned to one of three risk categories based on their composite CAMELS ratings. Each of the three risk categories has a range of rates, and the rate for a particular institution is determined based on seven financial ratios and the weighted average of its component CAMELS ratings. The FDIC may adjust assessment rates downward as the reserve ratio of the DIF exceeds 2.0% and higher thresholds. On September 30, 2018, the DIF exceeded its reserve ratio and, as such, the assessment regulations provide that after the reserve ratio reaches 1.38% (and provided that it remains at least 1.38%), the FDIC will automatically apply credits to small banks (total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion) to reduce small banks’ regular deposit insurance assessments up to the full amounts 
13

of their assessments or the full amount of their credits, whichever is less. Credits are awarded to any bank that was a small bank at some point during the credit calculation period. If a bank acquires another bank that is owed credits through merger or consolidation after the reserve ratio is exceeded, the acquiring bank is successor to any credits of the acquired small bank.
Future changes in insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on operating expenses and results of operations and we cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.
The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including us, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances that would result in termination of our deposit insurance.
Depositor Preference
The FDIA provides that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If the Company invests in or acquires an insured depository institution that fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the Company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC
Insured depository institutions and several other classes of financial institutions are subject to regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal requirements for an insured depository institution include (i) establishment of an anti-money laundering program that includes training and audit components; (ii) establishment of a "know your customer" program involving due diligence to confirm the identity of persons seeking to open accounts and to deny accounts to those persons unable to demonstrate their identities; (iii) the filing of currency transaction reports for deposits and withdrawals of large amounts of cash; (iv) additional precautions for accounts sought and managed for non-U.S. persons; and (v) verification and certification of money laundering risk with respect to private banking and foreign correspondent banking relationships. For many of these tasks a bank must keep records to be made available to its primary federal regulator. Anti- money laundering rules and policies are developed by a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, but compliance by individual institutions is overseen by its primary federal regulator which, in the Bank's case, is the OCC.
Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations, and they must consider an institution’s compliance with such obligations in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions. Compliance with these requirements has been a special focus of the Federal Reserve and the other Federal banking agencies in recent years. Any non-compliance is likely to result in an enforcement action, often with substantial monetary penalties and reputational damage. A savings association or bank that is required to strengthen its compliance program often must put on hold any initiatives that require banking agency approval.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If the Company or the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, the Company or the Bank must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.
Consumer Laws and Regulations
Banking organizations are subject to numerous Federal laws and regulations intended to protect consumers. These laws include, among others:

• | Truth in Lending Act;

14


• | Truth in Savings Act;


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act;


• | Expedited Funds Availability Act;


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act;


• | Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act;


• | Fair Housing Act;


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act;


• | Fair Debt Collection Act;


• | The GLB Act;


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act;


• | Right to Financial Privacy Act;


• | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act;


• | Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Act protecting against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices; and


• | state usury laws.

Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous to, and in addition to, those listed above. These federal, state and local laws regulate the manner in which financial institutions deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, or conducting other types of transactions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by state and local attorneys general and civil or criminal liability. The creation of the CFPB by the Dodd-Frank Act has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer financial protection laws.
Privacy and Cybersecurity
Several Federal statutes and regulations require insured depository institutions to take several steps to protect nonpublic consumer financial information. The Bank has prepared a privacy policy, which it must disclose to consumers annually. In some cases, the Bank must obtain a consumer's consent before sharing information with an unaffiliated third party, and the Bank must allow a consumer to opt out of the Bank's sharing of information with its affiliates for marketing and certain other purposes. Additional conditions come into play in the Bank's information exchanges with credit reporting agencies. The Bank's privacy practices and the effectiveness of its systems to protect consumer privacy are one of the subjects covered in the OCC's periodic compliance examinations.
The Federal banking agencies pay close attention to the cybersecurity practices of savings associations, banks, and their holding companies and affiliates. The interagency council of the agencies, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”), has issued several policy statements and other guidance for banks as new cybersecurity threats arise. FFIEC has recently focused on such matters as compromised customer credentials and business continuity planning. Examinations by the banking agencies now include review of an institution’s information technology and its ability to thwart cyber attacks.
The Community Reinvestment Act
The Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”) and related regulations are intended to encourage insured depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of low- to moderate-income communities and individuals within their institutions’ assessment areas. The CRA does not impose specific lending requirements, and it does not contemplate that an insured depository institution would take any action inconsistent with safety and soundness. 
15

The Federal banking agencies evaluate the performance of each of their regulated institutions periodically to determine whether an institution’s performance is “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” Each evaluation is made public, together with the underlying report. Outstanding or Satisfactory ratings often are a condition to qualify for certain regulatory benefits. 
The CRA requires the federal bank regulators to take into account an insured depository institution’s record in meeting the convenience and needs of the communities that the institution serves when considering an application by a bank to establish or relocate a branch or to enter into certain mergers or acquisitions. The Federal Reserve is required to consider the CRA records of a bank holding company’s subsidiary bank (or banks) when considering an application by the bank holding company to acquire a banking organization or to merge with another bank holding company. When we or the Bank apply for regulatory approval to engage in certain transactions, the regulators will consider the CRA performance of the target institutions and our depository institution subsidiaries. An evaluation of “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance” may block or impede regulatory approvals of our applications. The Bank received an overall CRA rating of “Satisfactory” as an intermediate small bank on its most recent CRA examination as of January 23, 2017.
Changes in Laws, Regulations or Policies
Federal, state and local legislators and regulators regularly introduce measures or take actions that would modify the regulatory requirements applicable to banks, their holding companies and other financial institutions. Changes in laws, regulations or regulatory policies could adversely affect the operating environment for us in substantial and unpredictable ways, increase our cost of doing business, impose new restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its operations or add significant operational constraints that might impair the Company’s profitability. Whether new legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the Company and its subsidiaries’ business, financial condition or results of operations cannot be predicted. The majority of these changes will be implemented over time by various regulatory agencies. The full effect that these changes will have on us and our subsidiaries remains uncertain at this time and may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.
Effect on Economic Environment
The policies of regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on borrowings and changes in reserve requirements with respect to deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. Federal Reserve monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The Company cannot predict the nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on its business and earnings.
