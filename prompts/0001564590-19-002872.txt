ITEM 1. Business
 
Prologis, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and is the sole general partner of Prologis, L.P. through which it holds substantially all of its assets. We operate Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. as one enterprise and, therefore, our discuss
ion and analysis refers to Prologis, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Prologis, L.P., collectively. We invest in real estate through wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities through which we co-invest with partners and investors. We have a significant ownership in the co-investment ventures, which may be consolidated or unconsolidated based on our level of control of the entity.
 
Prologis, Inc. began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Internal Revenue Code”). We believe the current organization and method of operation will enable Prologis, Inc. to maintain its status as a REIT. Prologis, L.P. was also formed in 1997.
 
We operate and evaluate our business on an owned and managed (“O&M”) basis, including properties that we wholly-own and properties that are owned by one of our co-investment ventures. We make decisions based on the property operations, regardless of our ownership interest. Our investment consists of our wholly-owned properties and our pro rata (or ownership) share of the properties owned in ventures. 
 
Our corporate headquarters is located at Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111, and our other principal office locations are in Amsterdam, Denver, Luxembourg, Mexico City, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo.
 
Our Internet address is www.prologis.com. All reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) are available and can be accessed free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our website. The common stock of Prologis, Inc. is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker “PLD” and is a component of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500.
 
THE COMPANY
 
Prologis is the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on key markets in 19 countries on four continents. We own, manage and develop well-located, high-quality logistics facilities. Our local teams actively manage our portfolio, which encompasses leasing and property management, capital deployment and opportunistic dispositions allowing us to recycle capital to self-fund our development and acquisition activities. The majority of our properties in the United States (“U.S.”) are wholly owned, while our properties outside the U.S. are generally held in co-investment ventures, to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency movements. 
 
Our irreplaceable portfolio is focused on the world’s most vibrant markets where consumption and supply chain reconfiguration drive logistics demand. In the developed markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan, key demand drivers include the reconfiguration of supply chains (strongly influenced by e-commerce trends), the demand for sustainable design features and the operational efficiencies that can be realized from high-quality logistics facilities. In emerging markets, such as Brazil, China and Mexico, growing affluence and the rise of a new consumer class have increased the need for modern distribution networks. Our strategy is to own the highest-quality logistics property portfolio in each of our target markets. These markets are characterized by what is most important for the consumption side of a logistics supply chain — large population centers with proximity to labor pools, surrounded by highways, rail service or ports. Customers turn to us because they know an efficient supply chain will make their businesses succeed, and that a strategic relationship with Prologis will create a competitive advantage.

On August 22, 2018, we acquired DCT Industrial Trust Inc. At acquisition, DCT Industrial Trust Inc. and DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP (“DCT,” collectively) merged into Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P., respectively, which we refer to as the DCT Transaction. The DCT Transaction was valued at $8.5 billion consisting of the issuance of $6.6 billion of equity and the assumption of $1.9 billion of debt, of which $1.8 billion was subsequently paid down. The DCT portfolio of logistics real estate assets was highly complementary to our portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential. The acquisition expanded our presence in the high growth U.S. markets of San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Southern California and South Florida. As a result of the closely aligned portfolios and similar business strategies, we have integrated the properties while adding minimal property management expenses. Our results for 2018 include the DCT portfolio from the date of acquisition. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information.
 
At December 31, 2018, we owned or had investments in properties, on a wholly-owned basis or through ventures, in the following regions (dollars in billions, based on gross book value and total expected investment (as defined below) and square feet in millions): 
 

Throughout this discussion, we reflect amounts in U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. Included in these amounts are consolidated and unconsolidated investments denominated in foreign currencies, principally the British pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen that are impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates when translated to U.S. dollars. We mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by investing outside the U.S. through co-investment ventures, borrowing in the functional currency of our consolidated subsidiaries and utilizing derivative financial instruments.
 
OPERATING SEGMENTS
 
Our business comprises two operating segments: Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital. 
 
Below is information summarizing consolidated activity within our segments over the last three years (in millions):

(1) | Net operating income (“NOI”) is not a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle (“GAAP”) financial measure. NOI from Real Estate Operations is calculated directly from our Consolidated Financial Statements as Rental Revenues, Rental Recoveries and Development Management and Other Revenues less Rental Expenses and Other Expenses. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a reconciliation of NOI to Operating Income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | A developed property moves into the operating portfolio when it meets our definition of stabilization, which is the earlier of one year after completion or reaching 90% occupancy. Amounts represent our total expected investment (“TEI”), which includes the estimated cost of development or expansion, including land, construction and leasing costs.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Real Estate Operations
 
Rental. Rental operations comprise the largest component of our operating segments and generally contribute 85% to 90% of our consolidated revenues, earnings and funds from operations (“FFO”). FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information. We collect rent from our customers through long-term operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs. We expect to generate long-term internal growth by increasing rents, maintaining high occupancy rates and controlling expenses. The primary driver of our revenue growth will be rolling in-place leases to current market rents coupled with increasing market rents. We believe our active portfolio management, combined with the skills of our property, leasing, maintenance, capital, energy, sustainability and risk management teams, will allow us to maximize rental revenues across our portfolio. A significant amount of our rental revenues, NOI and cash flows are generated in the U.S.
Development. We develop properties to meet our customers’ needs, deepen our market presence and refresh our portfolio quality. We believe we have a competitive advantage due to (i) the strategic locations of our land bank; (ii) the development expertise of our local teams; and (iii) the depth of our customer relationships. Successful development and redevelopment efforts provide significant earnings growth as projects lease up and generate income and increase the net asset value of our Real Estate Operations segment. Based on our current estimates, our consolidated land bank, excluding land we have under option contracts, has the potential to support the development of $7.7 billion of TEI of new logistics space. Generally, we develop properties in the U.S. for long-term hold and outside the U.S. for contribution to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. 
Strategic Capital
 
Real estate is a capital-intensive business that requires new capital to grow. Our strategic capital business gives us access to third-party capital, both private and public, allowing us to diversify our sources of capital and providing us with a broad range of options to fund our growth, while reducing our exposure to foreign currency movements for investments outside of the U.S. We partner with some of the world’s largest institutional investors to grow our business and provide incremental revenues, with a focus on long-term and open-ended ventures. We also access alternative sources of equity through two publicly traded vehicles: Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. in Japan and FIBRA Prologis in Mexico. We align our interests with those of our partners by holding significant ownership interests in all of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures (ranging from 15% to 50%).
 
This segment produces stable, long-term cash flows and generally contributes 10% to 15% of our consolidated revenues, earnings and FFO. We generate strategic capital revenues or fees from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, principally through asset and property management services. Substantially all of these revenues and fees are earned from long-term and open-ended ventures. We earn additional revenues by providing leasing, acquisition, construction, development, financing, legal and disposition services. In certain ventures, we also have the ability to earn revenues through incentive fees (“promotes” or “promote revenues”) periodically during the life of a venture or upon liquidation. We plan to profitably grow this business by increasing our assets under management in existing or new ventures. Most of the strategic capital revenues are generated outside the U.S. NOI in this segment is calculated directly from our Consolidated Financial Statements as Strategic Capital Revenues less Strategic Capital Expenses and excludes property-related NOI.
 
FUTURE GROWTH
 
We believe the quality and scale of our global portfolio, the expertise of our team, the depth of our customer relationships and the strength of our balance sheet give us unique competitive advantages to grow revenues, NOI, earnings, FFO and cash flows.

• | Rent Growth. We expect market rents to continue to grow over the next few years, driven by demand for the location and quality of our properties. Due to strong market rent growth over the last several years, our in-place leases have considerable upside potential. We estimate that our leases are more than 15% below current market rent on the basis of our weighted average ownership at December 31, 2018. Therefore, even if market rents remain flat, a lease renewal will translate into increased future rental income, on a consolidated basis or through the earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on our ownership. We have experienced positive rent change on rollover (comparing the net effective rent of the new lease to the prior lease for the same space) every quarter since 2013. We expect this trend to continue for several more years due to our current in-place rents being below market as well as increasing market rents.

• | Value Creation from Development. A successful development and redevelopment program involves maintaining control of well-located and entitled land. We believe the carrying value of our land bank is below its current fair value. Due to the strategic nature of our land bank and development expertise of our teams, we expect to realize future value creation as we build out the land bank. We measure the estimated development value as the margin above our anticipated cost to develop. We calculate the margin using estimated yield and capitalization rates from our underwriting models. As properties under development stabilize, we expect to realize the value creation principally through contributions to the unconsolidated co-investment ventures and increases in the NOI of our operating portfolio.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Economies of Scale from Growth. In 2018, we grew our consolidated real estate assets by 67 million square feet (or approximately 20%), primarily through the DCT Transaction, while lowering our general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses as a percentage of our average consolidated real estate investment. We believe we can continue to grow NOI and strategic capital revenues organically and through accretive acquisition and development, while strengthening our balance sheet and minimizing G&A expense growth.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition 
 
Real estate ownership is generally fragmented, and we therefore face competition from many owners and operators. Competitively priced logistics space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge, which in turn could affect our operating results. We may face competition regarding our capital deployment activities, including local, regional and national operators or developers. We also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business.
 
Despite the competition we may face, our strategic focus over the years has given us distinct competitive advantages.
 
These competitive advantages encompass the following:
 
 
• | a portfolio of properties strategically located in markets characterized by large population densities and growing consumption, typically near large labor pools and extensive transportation infrastructure;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the development of logistics facilities with sustainable design features that will continue to meet customer needs for high-quality buildings that can enable them to run their operations efficiently;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established relationships with customers served by our experienced and responsive local and regional teams;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the ability to leverage our organizational scale and structure to provide a single point of contact for our focus customers through our in-house global customer solutions team;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an investment across the portfolio in environmental stewardship, social responsibility and governance (“ESG”) practices that enhance asset value while improving sustainability performance;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proven property management and leasing expertise;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | relationships and track record with current and prospective investors in our strategic capital business;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a strategically located land bank;
--+-----------------------------------


• | local teams with development expertise; and
--+--------------------------------------------


• | a strong balance sheet and credit ratings, coupled with significant liquidity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) | Net effective rent (“NER”) is calculated using the estimated total cash to be received over the term of the lease (including base rent and expense reimbursements) divided by the lease term to determine the amount of rent and expense reimbursements received per year. Amounts derived in a currency other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average rate from the previous twelve months.

In our Strategic Capital segment, we view our partners and investors as our customers. At December 31, 2018, in our co-investment ventures, we partnered with approximately 120 investors, several of which invest in multiple ventures.
 
Employees 
 
The following table summarizes our total number of employees at December 31, 2018:
 
 
Regions | 
---------------+------
U.S. (1) | 878 
Other Americas | 136 
Europe | 375 
Asia | 228 
Total | 1,617


(1) | This includes employees who were based in the U.S. but also support other regions.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We allocate the employee costs to provide property management and leasing functions to our Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital segments based on the square footage of the respective portfolios. The employee costs to perform only Strategic Capital functions are allocated directly to that segment.
 
We believe we have good relationships with our employees. Prologis employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements, other than in Brazil, although some employees in Europe are represented by statutory Works Councils and as such, benefit from applicable labor agreements.
 
CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT
 
We maintain a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applicable to our board of directors (the “Board”) and all of our officers and employees, including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer, and other people 
 7

performing similar functions. A copy of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our website, www.prologis.com. In addition to being accessible through our website, copies of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct can be obtained, free of charge, upon written request to Investor Relations, Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111. Any amendments to or waivers of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that apply to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, the principal accounting officer, or other people performing similar functions, and that relate to any matter enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K, will be disclosed on our website.

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND GOVERNANCE 
 
The principles of ESG are a natural fit in our business strategy. ESG creates value for our company by strengthening our relationships with our customers, investors, employees and the communities in which we do business — delivering a strategic business advantage while positively impacting the environment. We invest in sustainable design features and practices that result in cost-savings and operational efficiency for our customers and reduce energy and water consumption, as well as decrease greenhouse gas emissions across our portfolio and corporate operations. We are committed to social responsibility and strengthening relationships important to our business through customer partnerships, investor outreach, community involvement, labor solutions and inclusion and diversity initiatives, as well as a focus on our and our customers’ employees through health and wellness programs and building design. Through our community workforce initiative, for example, we partner with local community organizations to provide logistics training and help our customers with their labor pain points, while benefitting local economies and providing new career opportunities. Our strong governance and oversight ensures the resilience of our business, creating a culture of uncompromising integrity through our Board independence and diversity, open communication with our stockholders and a risk management framework that supports our investment and process decisions. Our approach is reinforced by our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, as described above.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 
We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired, including land. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
INSURANCE COVERAGE
 
We carry insurance coverage on our properties. We determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets. Such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance. Insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance, self-insurance and a wholly-owned captive insurance entity. The costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through reimbursements from our customers. We believe our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties, business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
