Water Supplies and Contracts 
 
Our New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania water supply systems are physically separate and are not interconnected. In New Jersey, the Pinelands System and Bayview System are not interconnected with the Middlesex System or each other. We believe we have adequate sources of water supply to meet the current service requirements of our present customers in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania.
Middlesex System 
 
Our Middlesex System, which produced approximately 13.5 billion gallons in 2018, obtains water from surface sources and wells (groundwater sources). In 2018, surface sources of water provided approximately 69% of the Middlesex System’s water supply, groundwater sources provided approximately 22% from 31 wells and the balance was purchased from a non-affiliated water utility regulated by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (the NJBPU) under an agreement which expires February 27, 2021. This agreement provides for minimum purchases of 3.0 million gallons per day (mgd) of treated water with provisions for additional purchases. The Middlesex System’s distribution storage facilities are used to supply water to customers at times of peak demand, outages and emergencies.
 
The principal source of surface water for the Middlesex System is the Delaware & Raritan Canal, which is owned by the State of New Jersey and operated as a water resource by the New Jersey Water Supply Authority (NJWSA). Middlesex is under contract with the NJWSA, which expires November 30, 2023, and provides for average purchases of 27.0 mgd of untreated water from the Delaware & Raritan Canal, augmented by the Round Valley/Spruce Run Reservoir System. The untreated surface water is pumped to, and treated at, the Middlesex Carl J. Olsen (CJO) Water Treatment Plant.

Index
Tidewater System 
 
Our Tidewater System produced approximately 2.3 billion gallons in 2018, primarily from 159 wells. Tidewater expects to submit applications to Delaware regulatory authorities for the approval of additional wells as growth, customer demand and water quality warrant. Tidewater augments its water production with annual minimum purchases of 15.0 million gallons of treated water under contract from the City of Dover, Delaware. Tidewater does not have a central water treatment facility for the nearly 415 separate communities it serves. As the number has grown, many of Tidewater’s individual systems have been interconnected, forming several regional systems that are served by multiple water treatment facilities. 
Pinelands Water System 
 
Water supply to our Pinelands Water System is derived from four wells which produced approximately 133.1 million gallons in 2018. The aggregate pumping capacity of the four wells is 2.2 mgd.
Pinelands Wastewater System 
 
The Pinelands Wastewater System discharges into the South Branch of the Rancocas Creek through a tertiary treatment plant that provides clarification, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection. The total capacity of the plant is 0.5 mgd, and the system treated approximately 101.9 million gallons in 2018.
Bayview System 
 
Water supply to Bayview customers is derived from two wells, which produced approximately 6.9 million gallons in 2018.
 
TESI System 
 
The TESI System is comprised of seven wastewater treatment systems in Sussex County, Delaware, which are not interconnected. The treatment plants provide clarification, sedimentation, and disinfection. The combined total treatment capacity of the plants is 0.7 mgd. The TESI System treated approximately 116.5 million gallons in 2018.
Twin Lakes System
 
Water supply to Twin Lakes’ customers is derived from one well, which produced approximately 15.8 million gallons in 2018.
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 330 employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our employee relations are positive. Wages and benefits are reviewed annually and are considered competitive within both the industry and the regions where we operate.
Competition 
 
Our business in our franchised service areas is substantially free from direct competition with other public utilities, municipalities and other entities. However, our ability to provide contract water supply and wastewater services and operations and maintenance services that are not under the jurisdiction of a state public utility commission is subject to competition from other public utilities, municipalities and other entities. Although Tidewater and TESI have been granted exclusive franchises for each of their existing community water and wastewater systems, their ability to expand service areas can be affected by the Delaware Public Service Commission awarding franchises to other regulated water and wastewater utilities with whom we compete for such franchises and for projects.

Regulation 
 
Our rates charged to customers for water and wastewater services, the quality of the services we provide and certain other matters are regulated by the following state utility commissions (collectively, the Utility Commissions):

· | NJBPU
--+------


· | Delaware-Delaware Public Service Commission (DEPSC)
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | Pennsylvania-Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission (PAPUC)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our USA, USA-PA and White Marsh subsidiaries are not regulated public utilities as related to rates and service quality. However, they are subject to federal and state environmental regulations with respect to water quality and wastewater effluent quality to the extent such services are provided.
 
We are subject to environmental and water quality regulation by the following regulatory agencies (collectively, the Government Environmental Regulatory Agencies):
 
· | United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) with respect to operations in New Jersey
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services-Division of Public Health (DEDPH), and the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) with respect to operations in Delaware
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) with respect to operations in Pennsylvania
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, our issuances of equity securities are subject to the prior approval of the NJBPU and require registration with the SEC. Our issuances of long-term debt securities are subject to the prior approval of the appropriate Utility Commissions.
 
Regulation of Rates and Services 
 
For regulated rate setting purposes, we account separately for operations in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania to facilitate independent rate setting by the applicable Utility Commissions.
 
In determining our regulated utility rates, the respective Utility Commissions consider the revenue, expenses, rate base of property used and useful in providing service to the public and a fair rate of return on investments within their separate jurisdictions. Rate determinations by the respective Utility Commissions do not guarantee achievement to us of specific rates of return for our New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania regulated utility operations. Thus, we may not achieve the stated rates of return authorized by the Utility Commissions. In addition, there can be no assurance that any future rate increases will be granted or, if granted, that they will be in the amounts requested.
 
Middlesex Rate Matters
 
In March 2018, Middlesex’s petition to the NJBPU seeking permission to increase its base water rates was concluded, based on a negotiated settlement, resulting in an increase in annual operating revenues of $5.5 million. In its initial October 2017 filing with the NJBPU, Middlesex had sought an increase of $15.3 million to recover costs for capital infrastructure investments Middlesex has made, or has committed to make, to drinking water infrastructure since the prior filing in New Jersey in 2015 as well as increased operations and maintenance costs. During the pendency of this rate matter, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) was signed into law. Under the Tax Act the maximum corporate income tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Because income tax is one of the cost components used to determine a regulated utility’s revenue requirement, Middlesex was able to reduce its original rate increase request by $4.9 million to $10.4 million. The approved base water rates were designed to recover increased operating costs as well as a return on invested capital in rate base of $245.5 million, based on an authorized return on common equity of 9.6%. As part of the settlement, Middlesex received approval for regulatory accounting treatment of accumulated deferred income tax benefits associated with required adoption of tangible property regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service. The settlement agreement allowed for a four-year amortization period for $28.7 million of deferred income tax benefits as well as immediate and prospective recognition of the tangible property regulations’ tax benefits in future years. The rate increase became effective April 1, 2018.

Index
In December 2018, the NJBPU approved Middlesex’s petition to establish its Purchased Water Adjustment Clause (PWAC) tariff rate to recover additional annual costs of less than $0.1 million, primarily for the purchase of treated water from a non-affiliated water utility regulated by the NJBPU. A PWAC is a rate mechanism that allows for recovery of increased purchased water costs between base rate case filings. The PWAC is reset to zero once those increased costs are included in base rates. The PWAC tariff rate became effective on January 1, 2019.
Tidewater Rate Matters
 
Effective January 1, 2019, Tidewater increased its DEPSC-approved Distribution System Improvement Charge rate, which is expected to generate revenues of approximately $0.2 million annually.
 
In February 2019, Tidewater received approval from the DEPSC to reduce its rates, effective March 1, 2019, to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate enacted by the Tax Act, resulting in a 3.35% rate decrease for certain customer classes.
Pinelands Rate Matters
 
In 2016, the NJBPU approved $0.2 million and $0.1 million of increases, respectively, in Pinelands Water and Pinelands Wastewater’s annual base rates. The rate increases were necessitated by capital infrastructure investments by the companies, increased operations and maintenance costs and lower non-fixed fee revenues. The Pinelands Water base water rate increase was phased-in between 2016 and 2017.
Southern Shores Rate Matters
 
Under the terms of a multi-year DEPSC-approved agreement expiring in 2020, customer rates will increase on January 1st of each year to generate additional annual revenue of $0.1 million with each increase.
 
Twin Lakes Rate Matters
 
In 2016, the PAPUC approved a $0.1 million increase in Twin Lakes’ base water rates. The rate increase was necessitated by capital infrastructure investments Twin Lakes has made, or committed to make, and increased operations and maintenance costs. The rate increase is being phased in with the final phases implemented subsequent to completion of specific utility plant projects.
Future Rate Filings
 
Management monitors the need for rate relief for our regulated entities on an ongoing basis. When capital improvements and/or increases in operation and maintenance costs require rate relief, base rate increase requests are expeditiously filed with the respective Utility Commissions.
Water and Wastewater Quality and Environmental Regulations 
 
Government environmental regulatory agencies regulate our operations in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania with respect to water supply, treatment and distribution systems and the quality of the water.  They also regulate our operations with respect to wastewater collection, treatment and disposal.
 
Regulations relating to water quality require us to perform tests to ensure our water meets state and federal quality requirements. In addition, government environmental regulatory agencies continuously review current regulations governing the limits of certain organic compounds found in the water as byproducts of the treatment process. We participate in industry-related research to identify the various types of technology that might reduce the level of organic, inorganic and synthetic compounds found in water. The cost to water utilities to comply with the proposed water quality standards depends in part on the limits set in the regulations and on the method selected to treat the water to the required standards. We regularly test our water to determine compliance with existing required government environmental regulatory agencies’ water quality standards.

Treatment of groundwater in our Middlesex System is by chlorination for primary disinfection purposes. In addition, at certain locations, air stripping is used for removal of volatile organic compounds.
 
Surface water treatment in our Middlesex System is by conventional treatment; coagulation, sedimentation and filtration. The treatment process includes pH adjustment, chlorination for disinfection, and corrosion control for the distribution system.
 
Treatment of groundwater in our Tidewater System is by chlorination for disinfection purposes and, in some cases, pH correction and filtration for nitrate and iron removal and granular activated carbon filtration for organics removal. Chloramination is used for final disinfection at Southern Shores.
 
Treatment of groundwater in the Pinelands Water, Bayview and Twin Lakes Systems (primary disinfection only) is performed at individual well sites.
 
Treatment of wastewater in the Pinelands Wastewater and TESI Systems includes rotating biological contactors. Membrane bioreactors, sequential batch reactors and lagoon treatment coupled with spray irrigation are also utilized in the TESI System. 
 
The NJDEP, DEDPH and PADEP monitor our activities and review the results of water quality tests that are performed for adherence to applicable regulations. Other applicable regulations include the Federal Lead and Copper Rule, the Federal Surface Water Treatment Rule and the Federal Total Coliform Rule and regulations for maximum contaminant levels established for various volatile organic compounds.
 
Seasonality
 
Customer demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than other times of the year due primarily to additional consumption of water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand may vary with temperature and rainfall timing and overall levels. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the customer demand for our water may decrease and therefore, adversely affect our revenues.
