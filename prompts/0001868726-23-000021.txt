ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
OLAPLEX is an innovative, science-enabled, technology-driven beauty company. Since our inception in 2014, we have focused on delivering effective, patent-protected and proven performance in the prestige haircare category. Our mission is to blaze new paths to well-being that ignite confidence from the inside out.
We offer science-backed solutions that are designed to improve hair health and are trusted by stylists and consumers. We identify our consumers’ most relevant haircare concerns in collaboration with our passionate and highly engaged community of professional hairstylists and consumers and strive to address them through our proprietary technology and innovation capabilities. 
Our Products
OLAPLEX disrupted and revolutionized the prestige haircare category by creating the bond-building space in 2014. We have grown from an initial offering of three products sold exclusively through the professional channel to a broader suite of products offered through the professional, specialty retail and Direct to Consumer (“DTC”) channels that have been strategically developed to address three key uses: treatment, maintenance and protection. Our current product portfolio is comprised of fifteen unique and complementary products specifically developed to provide a holistic regimen for hair health. Our proprietary, patent-protected ingredient, Bis-aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate (“Bis-amino”), serves as a key differentiator in our ability to create trusted, high-quality products. Underpinning our product range is a portfolio of more than 160 worldwide patents which protects our proprietary technology and we believe creates both barriers to entry and a foundation for us to enter adjacent and other categories over time. Our patent claims are broadly drafted and include claims covering applications across adjacent categories in haircare and also other categories such as skin care and nail health.
Professional Products
Our current hair health platform is championed by four products that can be purchased and applied only by professional hairstylists, No. 1, No. 2, our 4-in-1 Moisture Mask and our Broad Spectrum Chelating Treatment. These products often serve as an introduction to our brand and a gateway to the remainder of our products that can be used both at home and in the salon.

Our Channels
We believe that a key differentiator of OLAPLEX is our synergistic omnichannel strategy. Our three sales channels, Professional, Specialty Retail, and Direct-to-Consumer, work together to reinforce relationships with current customers and introduce our products to an expanded potential customer base.
Professional Channel Rooted in our Hairstylist Community
In our professional channel, our products are sold primarily through wholesale beauty supply distributors who then sell those products to professional beauty industry outlets, such as professional beauty supply stores, salons and licensed hairstylists, for use in the salon or for hairstylists to sell to consumers for use at home. In 2022, we sold our products through over 115 professional distributors. Our international distributors are generally only permitted to sell our products to professional beauty industry outlets in specific territories, with some having the exclusive right to sell our products in the territory. Our agreements with professional beauty distributors also typically contain minimum purchase and sell-through requirements and prohibit the distributor from selling products deemed competitive with ours.
Specialty Retail Channel Focused on Reaching Consumers
Our specialty retail customers include specialty retailers with online and/or brick and mortar presences. In 2022, we sold our products through approximately 50 retailers in more than 20 countries throughout the world. 
Direct to Consumer Channel Leveraging our Digital Capabilities
We sell our products directly to consumers through our branded website, Olaplex.com, and third-party e-commerce platforms, including Amazon and pure play beauty and wellness partners. We have dedicated resources to implement creative, coordinated, brand-building strategies across our online activities to increase our direct access to consumer insights, which we believe has led to higher engagement and conversion, and can further enhance our innovation and branding performance.
Innovation
We believe that one of the key differentiators of our business is a powerful innovation platform. We conduct research in our OLAPLEX laboratory and employ a dedicated in-house research and development team, which includes scientists, product and packaging innovation specialists, and regulatory and compliance experts. We also incorporate feedback from our community of professional hairstylists and consumers to better understand their respective needs. These insights, combined with the efforts of our in-house research and development team, independent third party laboratory testing, and real-world salon testing, create a virtuous feedback loop. We develop our products in our laboratory and in partnership with national co-manufacturers, universities, and biotech companies to remain on the cutting edge of beauty technology. As our business continues to grow globally, we intend to focus on developing proprietary new technologies, improving existing products and exploring adjacent and other categories.

Our principal research and development center is located in the U.S. See “Item 2. Properties”.
Marketing
Our strategy to market and showcase our products begins with our omnichannel platform across the professional, specialty retail and DTC channels. In our professional channel, we market our products using educational seminars on our products’ application methods and consumer benefits. We have a dedicated portal on our website for professional customers to purchase and learn more about our products and have developed a mobile app for our professional community that serves as a resource on our brand and products and offers us the opportunity to more directly engage with hairstylists about our products. In addition, we use professional trade advertising, social media and other digital marketing to communicate to professionals and consumers the quality and performance characteristics of our products. 
In our specialty retail channel, we support our authorized retailers to drive in-store and e-commerce sales of our products, and we work with them to ensure the optimal presentation of our products in their stores or on their e-commerce sites. Advertising activities, in-store displays and online navigation are designed to attract new consumers, build demand and loyalty and introduce existing consumers to other product offerings. Our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with some retailers.
In our DTC channel, our digital first approach to performance marketing is designed to offer best-in-class customer experience on Olaplex.com, from load times, site navigation to a more intuitive check-out experience, all of which is designed to increase brand awareness, site traffic and conversion. 
In addition, top celebrity hairstylists and colorists from around the world serve as Olaplex brand ambassadors. These brand ambassadors help market our brand through educational events, social media and other publicity. We also are investing in new analytical capabilities to promote a more predictive and personalized experience across our sales channels. For example, we developed an online hair diagnostic quiz that allows consumers to discover our products by identifying their personal hair health needs, which are used to provide customized product recommendations. 
Our Customers
Our strategy is to build and maintain strong customer relationships globally, and we have over 215 customers across our omnichannel sales platform. Our products are sold in more than 100 countries across the world. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, the Company’s customers with net sales exceeding 10% of total net sales consisted of one customer which represented 16%, two customers which represented 25% in aggregate, and three customers which represented 32% in aggregate of total net sales. The accounts receivable balance for these customers as a percentage of total accounts receivable was immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 11% at December 31, 2021. The Company has not experienced material bad debt losses due to this concentration.
In 2022, approximately 56% of our net sales were generated in the U.S. and approximately 44% of our net sales were international, based upon the geographic location of customers who purchase our products. However, the majority of net sales are transacted in U.S. Dollars, our functional and reporting currency.
Supply Chain and Global Distribution Network
We believe that we have developed a flexible and resilient third-party supply chain that is capable of supporting long-term growth at scale. A core tenet of our supply chain strategy is leveraging strong relationships with our manufacturers and logistics partners to create an expansive supply network that is designed to create ample capacity without requiring significant additional capital investment. 
Our finished products are manufactured in the U.S. and Europe by four manufacturers. Two of these manufacturers are located in the U.S., one is located in Europe, and one maintains facilities in the U.S. and Europe. Cosway Company Inc. (“Cosway”) manufactures products that accounted for more than 77% of our net sales in 2022, and we continue to rely upon Cosway to manufacture a majority of our current product offerings. We are currently negotiating a new agreement with Cosway. In order to allow sufficient time to facilitate these negotiations, we have amended our current agreement with Cosway to expire on June 30, 2023. In support of our efforts to expand our manufacturing network, this amendment also removes the requirement that we exclusively purchase certain finished products from Cosway. We expect to be able to complete such negotiations prior to the expiration date of the current Cosway agreement (or be able to extend the expiration date as necessary until such time as we are able to enter into a new agreement with Cosway). In addition, as part of our manufacturing expansion efforts, on July 7, 2022, we entered into a supply agreement with our fourth manufacturer and began manufacturing in October 2022.
We utilize third parties with key operational facilities located inside and outside the U.S. to warehouse and distribute our products for sale throughout the world. We believe that our manufacturing and distribution network is sufficient to meet anticipated 
Table of Contents

demand. In addition, we have disaster recovery programs in place under some of our agreements with suppliers that allow for shifting of manufacturing capacity if necessary to account for disruptions due to natural disasters and other events outside of our or their control. We continue to implement improvements in capacity, technology, resiliency, and productivity and to align our manufacturing and distribution capabilities with anticipated regional and international sales demand and expansion of our customer base in targeted geographies. In 2022, we transitioned our primary U.S. warehouse and logistics center to a new provider and launched a new business to consumer third party warehouse and logistics center in Canada.
Seasonality
Our results of operations typically are slightly higher in the second half of the fiscal year due to increased levels of purchasing by consumers for special and holiday events and by retailers for the holiday selling seasons. However, fluctuations in net sales in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to a number of other factors, including macroeconomic factors, competitive activity and the level and scope of new product introductions by or promotional activities of our retail customers, which may impact their order placement and receipt of goods. 
Competition
Competition in the beauty industry is based on a variety of factors, including innovation, product efficacy, accessible pricing, brand recognition and loyalty, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce initiatives and other activities. Our competitors include Estee Lauder, Henkel AG & Co. KGaA, Kao Corporation, L’Oreal S.A. and Unilever. We also face competition from a number of independent brands. Certain of our competitors also have ownership interests in third parties that are our customers.
We believe we have a well-recognized and strong reputation in our core markets and that the quality and performance of our products, our emphasis on innovation, and our engagement with our professional and consumer communities position us to compete effectively.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure and assignment of inventions agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property.
As of December 31, 2022, we owned over 300 trademark registrations and applications globally. Our flagship trademark is OLAPLEX. We seek to register our OLAPLEX mark in all jurisdictions where we do business. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we owned over 160 issued patents worldwide, including 15 U.S. patents, and over 45 pending patent applications worldwide. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we filed 237 new trademark applications and were granted 61 new trademark registrations. We also filed three new patent applications and were issued seven new patents.
Our patent portfolio includes a family of patents that includes approximately 100 granted patents with claims that cover Olaplex’s commercial formulations Nos. 0-9, as well as their uses, and patents with claims that cover other haircare, nail and skincare products and/or their uses. The patents issued in this family have been granted in the U.S., Australia, throughout Europe, Brazil, Canada, Israel, New Zealand and Japan. The patents in this family are generally expected to expire in 2034. Any additional patents that grant from pending applications in this patent family would also be expected to expire in 2034.
Our patent portfolio also includes a family of patents with claims to protect us against competitor products that do not contain our Bis-amino ingredient. This patent family includes approximately 50 patents worldwide, including patents that have been granted in the U.S., throughout Europe, Brazil, Canada, Israel and Japan. The patents in this family are generally expected to expire in 2035. Any additional patents that grant from pending applications in this patent family would also be expected to expire in 2035.

Information Technology
Information technology supports all aspects of our business, including operations, marketing, sales, order processing, production and distribution networks, customer experience, finance, business intelligence, and product development. We continue to maintain and enhance our information technology systems and customer experiences in alignment with our long-term strategy. An increasing portion of our global information technology infrastructure is cloud-based and in partnership with industry-leading service providers. We believe this approach enables a high performance platform to support current and future requirements and enhances our scale and flexibility to respond to the demands of the business by leveraging advanced and leading-edge technologies.
We recognize that technology presents opportunities to build a competitive advantage, and we continue to invest in new capabilities across various aspects of our business. During 2022, we continued to improve our business-to-business and business-to-consumer integration, cybersecurity and technology infrastructure, supply chain network and integrations, business resilience capabilities, and analytics. In addition, in 2022 we improved our e-commerce experience, launched DTC sites in France and 
Table of Contents

Canada, continued our investment in business intelligence to drive deeper consumer insight and built a multi-language certification and education platform for our professional hairstylist and consumer communities.
In 2022 we expanded our data privacy program and our vendor risk program to protect our customers and our business and to align with the privacy regulations of countries in which we do business. We have enhanced and will continue to enhance our cybersecurity posture to align with industry standard cybersecurity frameworks. We review and assess our cybersecurity profile on an ongoing basis, and our policies and procedures establish processes for risk assessment, risk management, risk oversight, data protection, incident management, operations security, end user training, third-party reviews and implementation of general cybersecurity best practices. We have assessed, and will continue to assess, the adequacy of our policies, procedures, and internal controls for ensuring we meet defined cybersecurity standards.
Commitment to Social and Environmental Consciousness
We believe our responsibility extends beyond our products that build better hair. We continue to evaluate the impact we have on our environment and communities in an effort to further integrate sustainability and social impact into our strategy and business operations. In 2022 we began a partnership with a sustainability strategy firm to perform a double materiality assessment of various Environmental, Social and Governance factors relevant to the Company. This assessment, which will also incorporate feedback from several of our stakeholder groups, will be used by us to develop our multi-year Environmental, Social and Governance strategy.
•Environmental Sustainability. Our cruelty-free, non-toxic formulas are free of Parabens, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate “SLS”, Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate “SLES”, Phthalates and Phosphates. From our early days we have also limited the use of secondary packaging for our products. We estimate that between 2015 to 2022 we avoided the use of approximately 6.9 million pounds of paper packaging, which we estimate prevented approximately 56 million pounds of greenhouse gas from being emitted into the environment, conserved approximately 91 million gallons of water and saved approximately 70,000 trees from deforestation. In 2022, we also began a partnership with a leading sustainability rating provider to assess the sustainability practices of our third party manufacturing and logistics partners. 
•Charitable donations. In March 2022, we introduced the Shopping Gives program to our website. Shopping Gives is a charitable initiative whereby we donate $1 for every order that a retail or professional customer places, at no additional cost to the customer. Customers can choose from a list of causes to benefit from their purchase.
•Supporting Small Businesses. We are invested in the success of our hairstylist community as their businesses grow alongside ours. We are especially focused on providing support to the small business community and minority hairstylists. Currently, 98% of our salon community is made up of small businesses and a meaningful percentage of our hairstylists identify as racial or ethnic minorities.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, Olaplex employed 174 employees, 167 of whom are based in the U.S. and seven of whom are based in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). We also leverage contractors to supplement work in areas that are quickly growing such as technology, operations and accounting. We do not have any employees governed by a union. We utilize professional employer organizations (“PEO”), who are the employer of record of our U.S. and U.K. employees and administer our human resources, payroll and employee benefits functions.
Culture
We believe our commitment to our heritage in the prestige haircare category and encouragement of our employees to bring their whole self to work has created a culture that is paramount to our success. We are passionate about what we do, how our products impact lives and what our brand means to our community.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe it is important that our employees reflect the diversity of our hairstylist and consumer communities, and our focus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion remains a key differentiator in both our consumer strategy and internal culture. Our current Olaplex employees include former hairstylists whose unique perspectives and insights have helped us better understand our diverse consumer base and what matters to them. As a result of our efforts, we have created a diverse workplace environment where 76% of our employees identify as female and 45% identify as non-white as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, eight of the ten members of our board of directors (the “Board of Directors”) identify as female. We know through experience that different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds create a stronger and more creative work environment that can deliver better results.
In January 2021, we established DEI Champions within the Company who reinforce our collective commitment to foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture. Their roles are to identify opportunities to further engage our teammates through training 
Table of Contents

and education, encouraging candid conversations and leading by example. The team is led by a diverse group of six individual volunteers across different departments.
Compensation and Benefits
The core objective of our compensation program is to provide a package that will attract, motivate and reward exceptional employees. Through our “Healthy Hair ~ Healthy Body ~ Healthy Mind” wellness strategy, we are committed to providing comprehensive benefit options that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. We leverage both formal and informal programs to identify, foster and retain top talent. Our talent development is further supported by a professional development reimbursement program and an educational assistance plan designed to provide financial assistance to eligible team members. 
Government Regulation
Our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) in the U.S., as well as various other local and foreign regulatory authorities in the countries in which we operate. These laws and regulations principally relate to the ingredients, proper labeling, advertising, packaging, marketing, manufacture, safety, shipment and disposal of our products.
In the U.S., our products are considered “cosmetics” under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). The labeling of cosmetic products is subject to the requirements of the FDCA, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act and other FDA regulations. Cosmetics are not subject to pre-market approval by the FDA. However, certain ingredients, such as color additives, must be pre-approved for the specific intended use of the product and are subject to certain restrictions on their use. FDA regulations also prohibit or otherwise restrict the use of certain types of ingredients in cosmetic products. If a company has not adequately substantiated the safety of its products or ingredients, then a specific warning label is required. The FDA may, by regulation, require other warning statements on certain cosmetic products for specified hazards associated with such products. 
In addition, the FDA requires that cosmetic labeling and claims be truthful and not misleading. Moreover, cosmetics may not be marketed or labeled for their use in treating, preventing, mitigating, or curing disease or other conditions or in affecting the structure or function of the body, as such claims would cause the products to be a drug and subject to regulation as a drug. The FDA has issued warning letters to cosmetic companies alleging improper drug claims regarding their cosmetic products, including, for example, product claims regarding hair growth or preventing hair loss. In addition to FDA requirements, the FTC and state consumer protection laws and regulations can subject a cosmetics company to a range of requirements and theories of liability, including similar standards regarding false and misleading product claims, under which FTC or state enforcement or class-action lawsuits may be brought.
The FDA has not promulgated regulations establishing Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMPs”) for cosmetics. However, the FDA’s draft guidance on cosmetic GMPs, most recently updated in June 2013, provides recommendations related to process documentation, recordkeeping, building and facility design, equipment maintenance and personnel, and compliance with these recommendations can reduce the risk that the FDA finds such products have been rendered adulterated or misbranded in violation of applicable law. The FDA monitors compliance of cosmetic products through market surveillance and inspection of cosmetic manufacturers and distributors to ensure that the products are not manufactured under insanitary conditions or labeled in a false or misleading manner. Inspections also may arise from consumer or competitor complaints filed with the FDA. In the event the FDA identifies any violation of FDA regulation, the FDA may request or a manufacturer may independently decide to conduct a recall or market withdrawal of product or to make changes to its manufacturing processes, product formulations or labels.
The Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act (“MoCRA”), signed into law on December 29, 2022, will expand the FDA’s regulatory oversight of cosmetics when it becomes effective on December 29, 2023. MoCRA will require, among other things, that manufacturers of cosmetics products register their facilities and list their cosmetic products with the FDA, maintain for FDA review records demonstrating adequate substantiation of cosmetic product safety, comply with GMP regulations for cosmetic products and report serious adverse events associated with their cosmetic products to the FDA. MoCRA also grants the FDA authority to issue mandatory recalls of cosmetic products that pose a risk of serious adverse health consequences. 
The FTC also regulates and can bring enforcement action against cosmetic companies for deceptive advertising and lack of adequate scientific substantiation for claims. The FTC has specialized requirements for certain types of claims. For example, the FTC’s “Green Guides” regulate how “free-of,” “non-toxic” and similar claims must be framed and substantiated. In addition, the FTC regulates the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising as well as relationships between advertisers and social media influencers pursuant to the FTC’s Endorsement Guides. The Endorsement Guides provide that an endorsement must reflect the honest opinion of the endorser, based on “bona fide” use of the product, and cannot be used to make a claim about a product that the product’s marketer could not itself legally make. Additionally, companies marketing a product must disclose any material connection between an endorser and the company that consumers would not expect that would affect how consumers evaluate the endorsement. If an advertisement features endorsements from people who achieved above average results from using a product, 
Table of Contents

the advertiser must have proof that the endorser’s experience can generally be achieved using the product as described; otherwise, an advertiser must clearly communicate the generally expected results of a product and have a reasonable basis for such representations.
Although the Green Guides and Endorsement Guides do not operate directly with the force of law, they provide guidance about what the FTC generally believes the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act, requires in the context using of “green” claims and endorsements and testimonials in advertising. Any practices inconsistent with the Green Guides and Endorsement Guides can result in violations of the FTC Act’s proscription against unfair and deceptive practices.
In the European Union, the sale of cosmetic products is regulated under the E.U. Cosmetics Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, which provides the general regulatory framework for finished cosmetic products placed on the E.U. market. The overarching requirement is that a cosmetic product made available on the E.U. market must be safe for human health when used under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use, taking account of the following: (a) presentation including conformity with Directive 87/357/EEC regarding health and safety of consumers; (b) labelling; (c) instructions for use and disposal; (d) any other indication or information provided by the responsible person; and (e) the maintenance of a product safety report.
Generally, there is no requirement for pre-market approval of cosmetic products in the European Union. However, manufacturers are required to notify their products via the centralized E.U. cosmetic products notification portal. Manufacturers are responsible for safety of their marketed finished cosmetic products and must undergo an appropriate scientific safety assessment before cosmetic products are sold. The E.U. Cosmetics Regulation requires the manufacture of cosmetic products to comply with GMPs, which is presumed where the manufacture is in accordance with the relevant harmonized standards. In addition, text, names, trademarks, pictures and figurative or other signs used in the labelling and advertising of cosmetic products cannot imply that these products have characteristics or functions they do not actually have. Any product claims in labelling must be capable of being substantiated. 
The E.U. Cosmetics Regulation has been retained in U.K legislation, subject to certain amendments, and is applicable to Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and Northern Ireland. Such amendments include notification of cosmetic products made available to consumers in Great Britain to the Office for Product and Safety Standards and the requirement to have a responsible person established in the U.K. We rely on expert consultants, Obelis, for our E.U. and U.K. product registrations and review of our labelling for compliance with E.U. and U.K. regulation.
We are also subject to a number of federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. These laws and regulations may involve user privacy, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions and online payment services. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts. 
We are subject to federal, state, local and international laws regarding privacy and data protection. Such laws and regulations are evolving and may be subject to significant change. In addition, the application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, and they may be interpreted and applied inconsistently by different regulators and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) imposes a strict data protection compliance regime and provides for significant potential fines or penalties for violations. The GDPR applies to the processing and transfer of personal data. The GDPR has also been incorporated into the laws of the U.K. (“U.K. GDPR”) alongside the Data Protection Act 2018. Additionally, a 2020 decision from the Court of Justice of the European Union and related regulatory guidance may impact our ability to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area or the U.K. to the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Recently enacted U.S. state privacy laws require many companies that process personal information, including us, to make disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices. In some instances, these laws allow individuals to request access to, or correction or deletion of, their personal information, as well as to opt out of the sale, or sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes, of such information to third parties, or to opt out of the processing of their personal information for targeted advertising or certain automated decision making and profiling activities. Certain of these laws also require companies, including us, to obtain prior opt-in consent to the processing of specified sensitive personal information or to provide the opportunity to limit the use or disclosure of such information in certain circumstances. These new state privacy laws could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., both at the state and federal level.
