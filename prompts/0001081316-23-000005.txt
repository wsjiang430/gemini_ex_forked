PACIFICORP
General
PacifiCorp, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BHE, is a U.S. regulated electric utility company headquartered in Oregon that serves approximately 2.0 million retail electric customers in portions of Utah, Oregon, Wyoming, Washington, Idaho and California. PacifiCorp is principally engaged in the business of generating, transmitting, distributing and selling electricity. PacifiCorp's combined service territory covers approximately 141,500 square miles and includes diverse regional economies across six states. No single segment of the economy dominates the combined service territory, which helps mitigate PacifiCorp's exposure to economic fluctuations. In the eastern portion of the service territory, consisting of Utah, Wyoming and southeastern Idaho, the principal industries are manufacturing, mining or extraction of natural resources, agriculture, technology, recreation and government. In the western portion of the service territory, consisting of Oregon, southern Washington and northern California, the principal industries are agriculture, manufacturing, forest products, food processing, technology, government and primary metals. In addition to retail sales, PacifiCorp buys and sells electricity on the wholesale market with other utilities, energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants to balance and optimize the economic benefits of electricity generation, retail customer loads and existing wholesale transactions. Certain PacifiCorp subsidiaries support its electric utility operations by providing coal mining services.
PacifiCorp's operations are conducted under numerous franchise agreements, certificates, permits and licenses obtained from federal, state and local authorities. The average term of the franchise agreements is approximately 22 years. Several of these franchise agreements allow the municipality the right to seek amendment to the franchise agreement at a specified time during the term. PacifiCorp generally has an exclusive right to serve electric customers within its service territories and, in turn, has an obligation to provide electric service to those customers. In return, the state utility commissions have established rates on a cost-of-service basis, which are designed to allow PacifiCorp an opportunity to recover its costs of providing services and to earn a reasonable return on its investments.
PacifiCorp was incorporated under the laws of the state of Oregon in 1989 and its principal executive offices are located at 825 N.E. Multnomah Street, Suite 1900 Portland, Oregon 97232, its telephone number is (888) 221-7070 and its internet address is www.pacificorp.com. PacifiCorp delivers electricity to customers in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho under the trade name Rocky Mountain Power and to customers in Oregon, Washington and California under the trade name Pacific Power.
All shares of PacifiCorp's common stock are indirectly owned by BHE. PacifiCorp also has shares of preferred stock outstanding that are subject to voting rights in certain limited circumstances.

(1)Repowered dates are associated with component replacements on existing wind-powered generating facilities commonly referred to by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") as repowering. IRS rules provide for re-establishment of the PTCs for an existing wind-powered generating facility upon the replacement of a significant portion of its components. If the degree of component replacement in such projects meets IRS guidelines, PTCs are re-established for 10 years at rates that depend upon the date on which construction begins.
(2)Facility Net Capacity represents the lesser of nominal ratings or any limitations under applicable interconnection, power purchase, or other agreements for intermittent resources and the total net dependable capability available during summer conditions for all other units. An intermittent resource's nominal rating is the manufacturer's contractually specified capability (in MWs) under specified conditions. Net Owned Capacity indicates PacifiCorp's ownership of Facility Net Capacity.
(3)Jim Bridger Units 1 and 2 are currently operating under a consent decree as described in "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K.
(4)Naughton No. 3 was converted from a coal-fueled to a natural gas-fueled generating facility in 2020.
(5)In November 2022, the FERC issued a license surrender order for the four mainstem Klamath hydroelectric dams. The remaining three hydroelectric facilities owned by PacifiCorp on the Klamath River are now included in minor hydroelectric facilities. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of PacifiCorp in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.
The following table shows the percentages of PacifiCorp's total energy supplied by energy source for the years ended December 31: 

 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Coal | 43 | % | | 48 | % | 48 | %

(1)All or some of the renewable energy attributes associated with generation from these sources may be: (a) used in future years to comply with RPS or other regulatory requirements, (b) sold to third parties in the form of RECs or other environmental commodities, or (c) excluded from energy purchased.
PacifiCorp is required to have resources available to continuously meet its customer needs and reliably operate its electric system. The percentage of PacifiCorp's energy supplied by energy source varies from year to year and is subject to numerous operational, economic and environmental factors such as planned and unplanned outages, fuel commodity prices, fuel transportation costs, weather, legislative considerations, transmission constraints and wholesale market prices of electricity. PacifiCorp evaluates these factors continuously in order to facilitate economic dispatch of its generating facilities. When factors for one energy source are less favorable, PacifiCorp places more reliance on other energy sources. For example, PacifiCorp can generate more electricity using its low-cost wind-powered and hydroelectric generating facilities when factors associated with these facilities are favorable. In addition to meeting its customers' energy needs, PacifiCorp is required to maintain operating reserves on its system to mitigate the impacts of unplanned outages or other disruption in supply, and to meet intra-hour changes in load and resource balance. This operating reserve requirement is dispersed across PacifiCorp's generation portfolio on a least-cost basis based on the operating characteristics of the portfolio. Operating reserves may be held on hydroelectric, coal-fueled, natural gas-fueled or certain types of interruptible load. PacifiCorp manages certain risks relating to its supply of electricity and fuel requirements by entering into various contracts, which may be accounted for as derivatives and may include forwards, options, swaps and other agreements. Refer to "General Regulation" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of energy cost recovery by jurisdiction and to PacifiCorp's Item 7A in this Form 10-K for a discussion of commodity price risk and derivative contracts.
    Coal
PacifiCorp has interests in coal mines that support its coal-fueled generating facilities and jointly operates the Bridger surface coal mine. The Bridger underground mine ceased coal production in November 2021. These mines supplied 21%, 21% and 16% of PacifiCorp's total coal requirements during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The remaining coal requirements for PacifiCorp's coal-fueled generating facilities are acquired through long- and short-term third-party contracts.
Most of PacifiCorp's coal reserves are held through agreements with the federal Bureau of Land Management and from certain states and private parties. The agreements generally have multi-year terms that may be renewed or extended and require payment of rents and royalties. In addition, federal and state regulations require that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of mining operations and upon completion of mining activities.
Coal reserve estimates are subject to adjustment as a result of the development of additional engineering and geological data, new mining technology and changes in regulation and economic factors affecting the utilization of such reserves.
Recoverability by surface mining methods typically ranges from 90% to 95%. To meet applicable standards, PacifiCorp blends its coal with contracted coal and utilizes emissions reduction technologies for controlling SO2 and other emissions. For fuel needs at PacifiCorp's coal-fueled generating facilities in excess of coal reserves available, PacifiCorp believes it will be able to purchase coal under both long- and short-term contracts to supply its generating facilities over their currently expected remaining useful lives.
    Natural Gas
PacifiCorp uses natural gas as fuel for its generating facilities that use combined-cycle, simple-cycle and steam turbines. Oil and natural gas are also used for igniter fuel and standby purposes. These sources are presently in adequate supply and available to meet PacifiCorp's needs.
PacifiCorp enters into forward natural gas purchases at fixed or indexed market prices. PacifiCorp purchases natural gas in the spot market with both fixed and indexed market prices for physical delivery to fulfill any fuel requirements not already satisfied through forward purchases of natural gas and sells natural gas in the spot market for the disposition of any excess supply if the forecasted requirements of its natural gas-fueled generating facilities decrease. PacifiCorp also utilizes financial swap contracts to mitigate price risk associated with its forecasted fuel requirements.
Wind 
PacifiCorp has pursued renewable resources as a viable, economical and environmentally prudent means of supplying electricity and complying with laws and regulations. Renewable resources have low to no emissions and require little or no fossil fuel. The generation from PacifiCorp's wind-powered generating fleet, comprised of newly constructed and recently repowered wind-powered generating facilities, qualifies for 100% of the federal PTCs available for 10 years from the date the equipment is placed in-service. In addition to the discussion contained herein regarding repowering activities, refer to "Regulatory Matters" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K. 
    Hydroelectric and Other Renewable Resources
The amount of electricity PacifiCorp is able to generate from its hydroelectric generating facilities depends on a number of factors, including snowpack in the mountains upstream of its hydroelectric generating facilities, reservoir storage, precipitation in its watersheds, generating unit availability and restrictions imposed by oversight bodies due to competing water management objectives. 
PacifiCorp operates the majority of its hydroelectric generating portfolio under long-term licenses. The FERC regulates 98% of the net capacity of this portfolio through 14 individual licenses, which have terms of 30 to 50 years. The licenses for these hydroelectric generating facilities expire at various dates through 2061. A portion of this portfolio is licensed under the Oregon Hydroelectric Act. For discussion of PacifiCorp's hydroelectric relicensing activities, including updated information regarding the Klamath River hydroelectric system, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of PacifiCorp in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
    Wholesale Activities
PacifiCorp purchases and sells electricity in the wholesale markets as needed to balance its generation with its retail load obligations. PacifiCorp may also purchase electricity in the wholesale markets when it is more economical than generating electricity from its own facilities and may sell surplus electricity in the wholesale markets when it can do so economically. When prudent, PacifiCorp enters into financial swap contracts and forward electricity sales and purchases for physical delivery at fixed prices to reduce its exposure to electricity price volatility. 
    Energy Imbalance Market
PacifiCorp and the California ISO implemented an EIM in November 2014, which reduces costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources, more effectively integrates renewables and enhances reliability through improved situational awareness and responsiveness. The EIM expands the real-time component of the California ISO's market technology to optimize and balance electricity supply and demand every five minutes across the EIM footprint. The EIM is voluntary and available to all balancing authorities in the western U.S. EIM market participants submit bids to the California ISO market operator before each hour for each generating resource they choose to be dispatched by the market. Each bid is comprised of a dispatchable operating range, ramp rate and prices across the operating range. The California ISO market operator uses sophisticated technology to select the least-cost resources to meet demand and send simultaneous dispatch signals to every participating generator across the EIM footprint every five minutes. In addition to generation resource bids, the California ISO market operator also receives continuous real-time updates of the transmission grid network, meteorological and load forecast information that it uses to optimize dispatch instructions. Outside the EIM footprint, utilities in the western U.S. do not utilize comparable technology and are largely limited to transactions within the borders of their balancing authority area to balance supply and demand intra-hour using a combination of manual and automated dispatch. The EIM delivers customer benefits by leveraging automation and resource diversity to result in more efficient dispatch, more effective integration of renewables and improved situational awareness. Benefits are expected to increase further with renewable resource expansion and as more entities join the EIM, bringing incremental resource diversity. In December 2022, PacifiCorp announced its intention to join the California ISO Extended Day-Ahead Market in 2024.
Transmission and Distribution
PacifiCorp operates one balancing authority area in the western portion of its service territory ("PacifiCorp-West") and one balancing authority area in the eastern portion of its service territory ("PacifiCorp-East"). A balancing authority area is a geographic area with transmission systems that control generation to maintain schedules with other balancing authority areas and ensure reliable operations. In operating the balancing authority areas, PacifiCorp is responsible for continuously balancing electricity supply and demand by dispatching generating resources and interchange transactions so that generation internal to the balancing authority area, plus net imported power, matches customer loads. Deliveries of energy over PacifiCorp's transmission system are managed and scheduled in accordance with the FERC's requirements.
PacifiCorp's transmission system is part of the Western Interconnection, which includes the interconnected transmission systems of 14 western states, two Canadian provinces and parts of Mexico. PacifiCorp's transmission system, together with contractual rights on other transmission systems, enables PacifiCorp to integrate and access generation resources to meet its customer load requirements. PacifiCorp's transmission and distribution systems included approximately 17,100 miles of transmission lines in 10 states, 65,300 miles of distribution lines and 900 substations as of December 31, 2022.
PacifiCorp's transmission and distribution system is managed on a coordinated basis to obtain maximum load-carrying capability and efficiency. Portions of PacifiCorp's transmission and distribution systems are located:
•On property owned or used through agreements by PacifiCorp;
•Under or over streets, alleys, highways and other public places, the public domain and national forests and state and federal lands under franchises, easements or other rights that are generally subject to termination;
•Under or over private property as a result of easements obtained primarily from the title holder of record; or
•Under or over Native American reservations through agreements with the U.S. Secretary of Interior or Native American tribes.

PacifiCorp's Energy Gateway Transmission Expansion Program represents plans to build over 2,000 miles of new high-voltage transmission lines, with an estimated cost of approximately $11 billion, primarily in Wyoming, Utah, Idaho and Oregon. The approximately $11 billion estimated cost includes: (a) the 135-mile, 345-kV transmission line between the Terminal substation near the Salt Lake City Airport and the Populus substation in Downey, Idaho, placed in-service in 2010; (b) the 100-mile, 345/500-kV transmission line between the Mona substation in central Utah and the Oquirrh substation in the Salt Lake Valley, placed in-service in 2013; (c) the 170-mile, 345-kV transmission line between the Sigurd substation in central Utah and the Red Butte substation in southwest Utah, placed in-service in 2015; (d) the 140-mile, 500-kV transmission line between the Aeolus substation near Medicine Bow, Wyoming and the Jim Bridger generating facility, placed in-service in 2020; (e) the 416-mile, 500-kV high-voltage transmission line between the Aeolus substation and the Clover substation near Mona, Utah, expected to be placed in-service in 2024; (f) the 59-mile, 230-kV high-voltage transmission line between the Windstar substation near Glenrock, Wyoming and the Aeolus substation, expected to be placed in-service in 2024; (g) the 290-mile, 500-kV high-voltage transmission line from the Longhorn substation near Boardman, Oregon to the Hemingway substation near Boise, Idaho (a joint project), expected to be placed in-service in 2026; (h) the 14-mile, 345-kV high-voltage transmission line between the Oquirrh substation and the Terminal substation, expected to be placed in-service in 2024; and (i) remaining segments that are expected to be placed in-service in future years, depending on load growth, economic analysis, IRP results, siting, permitting and construction schedules. The transmission line segments are intended to: (a) address customer load growth; (b) improve system reliability; (c) reduce transmission system constraints; (d) provide access to diverse generation resources, including renewable and zero carbon resources; and (e) improve the flow of electricity throughout PacifiCorp's six-state service area. Proposed transmission line segments are evaluated to ensure optimal benefits and timing before committing to move forward with permitting and construction. Through December 31, 2022, $3.8 billion had been spent and $2.3 billion, including AFUDC, had been placed in-service.
Future Generation, Conservation and Energy Efficiency
Energy Supply Planning 
As required by certain state regulations, PacifiCorp uses an IRP to develop a long-term resource plan to ensure that PacifiCorp can continue to provide reliable and cost-effective electric service to its customers while maintaining compliance with existing and evolving environmental laws and regulations. The IRP process identifies the amount and timing of PacifiCorp's expected future resource needs, accounting for planning uncertainty, risks, reliability, state energy policies and other factors. The IRP is prepared following a public process, which provides an opportunity for stakeholders to participate in PacifiCorp's resource planning process. PacifiCorp files its IRP biennially with the state commissions in each of the six states where PacifiCorp operates. Five states indicate whether the IRP meets the state commission's IRP standards and guidelines, a process referred to as "acknowledgment" in some states. Acknowledgment by a state commission does not address recovery or prudency of resources ultimately selected.
In September 2021, PacifiCorp filed its 2021 IRP with its state commissions and subsequently filed its 2021 IRP Update in March and April 2022. In March 2022, the OPUC acknowledged PacifiCorp's 2021 IRP and its preferred portfolio. In June 2022, the UPSC issued an order declining to acknowledge the 2021 IRP due to its determination that PacifiCorp did not meet the commission's IRP guidelines by excluding new natural gas-fueled resources in its modeling of the 2021 IRP's preferred portfolio, as well as the commission's view that PacifiCorp did not provide ample time for public input and information exchange during the development of the IRP. The UPSC did approve the 2022 All Source RFP ("2022AS RFP") to procure resources identified in the 2021 IRP. In August 2022, the IPUC acknowledged PacifiCorp's 2021 IRP and its preferred portfolio. Reviews of the 2021 IRP by the WPSC and the WUTC are ongoing.
The 2021 IRP includes investments in new renewable energy resources, new battery storage resources, expanded transmission investments and advanced nuclear resources. New renewable energy resources in the IRP include more than 1,800 MWs of new wind-powered generation, over 2,100 MWs of new solar-powered generation and nearly 700 MWs of new battery storage capacity by 2025. The IRP also outlines PacifiCorp's plan to retire or convert to natural gas all coal-fueled resources by 2042.
Requests for Proposals
PacifiCorp issues individual RFPs, each of which typically focuses on a specific category of generation resources consistent with the IRP or other customer-driven demands. The IRP and the RFPs provide for the identification and staged procurement of resources to meet load and state specific compliance obligations. Depending upon the specific RFP, applicable laws and regulations may require PacifiCorp to file draft RFPs with the UPSC, the OPUC and the WUTC. Approval by the UPSC, the OPUC or the WUTC may be required depending on the nature of the RFPs. 
A draft of PacifiCorp's 2022AS RFP was approved by the WUTC in March 2022 and by the UPSC and the OPUC in April 2022. The 2022AS RFP was issued to market in April 2022. PacifiCorp-owned bids were due late November 2022 and market bids are due February 2023. PacifiCorp expects to provide a recommended final shortlist for state commission and independent evaluator consideration by late June 2023.
Energy Efficiency Programs
PacifiCorp has provided its customers with a comprehensive set of DSM programs since the 1970s. The programs are designed to reduce energy consumption and more effectively manage when energy is used, including management of seasonal peak loads. PacifiCorp offers services to customers such as energy engineering audits and information on how to improve the efficiency of their homes and businesses. To assist customers in investing in energy efficiency, PacifiCorp offers rebates or incentives encouraging the purchase and installation of high-efficiency equipment such as lighting, heating and cooling equipment, weatherization, motors, process equipment and systems, as well as incentives for energy project management, efficient building operations and efficient construction. Incentives are also paid to solicit participation in load management programs by residential, business and agricultural customers through programs such as PacifiCorp's residential and small commercial air conditioner load control program, battery control program and irrigation equipment load control programs. Although subject to prudence reviews, state regulations allow for recovery of costs incurred for the DSM programs through state-specific energy efficiency surcharges to retail customers or for recovery of costs through rates. During 2022, PacifiCorp spent $167 million on these DSM programs, resulting in an estimated 514,928 MWhs of first-year energy savings and an estimated 432 MWs of peak load management. In addition to these DSM programs, PacifiCorp has load curtailment contracts with a number of large industrial customers that deliver up to 372 MWs of load reduction when needed, depending on the customers' actual operations. Costs associated with the large industrial load curtailment program are captured in the respective customers' retail special contracts. The corresponding recovery of costs was approved by the respective state commissions or through PacifiCorp's general rate case process.
Human Capital
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, PacifiCorp had approximately 4,800 employees, of which approximately 57% were covered by union contracts, principally with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Utility Workers Union of America and the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers.

Variations in weather, economic conditions and various conservation and energy efficiency measures and programs can impact customer energy requirements. Wholesale sales are primarily impacted by market prices for energy. 
There are seasonal variations in MidAmerican Energy's electricity sales that are principally related to weather and the related use of electricity for air conditioning. Additionally, electricity sales are priced higher in the summer months compared to the remaining months of the year. As a result, 40% to 50% of MidAmerican Energy's regulated electric retail revenue is reported in the months of June, July, August and September.
A degree of concentration of sales exists with certain large electric retail customers. Sales to the 10 largest customers, from a variety of industries, comprised 25%, 24% and 23% of total retail electric sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales to electronic data storage customers included in the 10 largest customers comprised 18%, 16% and 16% of total retail electric sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The annual hourly peak demand on MidAmerican Energy's electric system usually occurs as a result of air conditioning use during the cooling season. Peak demand represents the highest demand on a given day and at a given hour. On August 2, 2022, retail customer usage of electricity caused a new record hourly peak demand of 5,386 MWs on MidAmerican Energy's electric distribution system, which is 150 MWs greater than the previous record hourly peak demand of 5,236 MWs set June 17, 2021.

(1)All or some of the renewable energy attributes associated with generation from these sources may be: (a) used in future years to comply with RPS or other regulatory requirements, (b) sold to third parties in the form of RECs or other environmental commodities, or (c) excluded from energy purchased.
MidAmerican Energy is required to have accredited resources available for dispatch by MISO to continuously meet its customer's needs and reliably operate its electric system. The percentage of MidAmerican Energy's energy supplied by energy source varies from year to year and is subject to numerous operational and economic factors such as planned and unplanned outages, fuel commodity prices, fuel transportation costs, weather, environmental considerations, transmission constraints, and wholesale market prices of electricity. MidAmerican Energy evaluates these factors continuously in order to facilitate economic dispatch of its generating facilities by MISO. When factors for one energy source are less favorable, MidAmerican Energy places more reliance on other energy sources. For example, MidAmerican Energy can generate more electricity using its low cost wind-powered generating facilities when factors associated with these facilities are favorable. When factors associated with wind resources are less favorable, MidAmerican Energy must increase its reliance on more expensive generation or purchased electricity. Refer to "General Regulation" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of energy cost recovery by jurisdiction.
Wind
MidAmerican Energy owns more wind-powered generating capacity than any other U.S. rate-regulated electric utility and believes wind-powered generation offers a viable, economical and environmentally prudent means of supplying electricity and complying with laws and regulations. Pursuant to ratemaking principles approved by the IUB, facilities accounting for 92% of MidAmerican Energy's wind-powered generating capacity in-service at December 31, 2022, are authorized to earn over their regulatory lives a fixed rate of return on equity ranging from 11.0% to 12.2% on the depreciated cost of their original construction, which excludes the cost of later replacements, in any future Iowa rate proceeding. MidAmerican Energy's wind-powered generating facilities, including those facilities where a significant portion of the equipment was replaced, commonly referred to as repowered facilities, are eligible for federal renewable electricity PTCs for 10 years from the date the facilities are placed in-service. PTCs are earned as energy from qualifying wind-powered generating facilities is produced and sold. PTCs for MidAmerican Energy's wind-powered generating facilities currently in-service began expiring in 2014, with final expiration in 2032. Since 2014, MidAmerican Energy has repowered, or plans to repower, 2,204 MWs of wind-powered generating facilities for which PTCs had expired by the end of 2022.
Of the 7,414 MWs (nameplate capacity) of wind-powered generating facilities in-service as of December 31, 2022, 7,249 MWs were generating PTCs, including 2,310 MWs of repowered facilities. PTCs earned by MidAmerican Energy's wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service prior to 2013, except for repowered facilities, were included in MidAmerican Energy's Iowa EAC, through which MidAmerican Energy is allowed to recover fluctuations in its electric retail energy costs. All of the eligibility of those facilities to earn PTCs had expired by the end of 2022. MidAmerican Energy earned PTCs totaling $710 million, $574 million and $510 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of which 4%, 12% and 15%, respectively, were included in the Iowa EAC.
Coal
All of the coal-fueled generating facilities operated by MidAmerican Energy are fueled by low-sulfur, western coal from the Powder River Basin in northeast Wyoming. MidAmerican Energy's coal supply portfolio includes multiple suppliers and mines under short-term and multi-year agreements of varying terms and quantities through 2027. MidAmerican Energy believes supplies from these sources are presently adequate and available to meet MidAmerican Energy's needs. MidAmerican Energy's coal supply portfolio has substantially all of its expected 2023 and a majority of 2024 requirements under fixed-price contracts. MidAmerican Energy regularly monitors the western coal market for opportunities to enhance its coal supply portfolio. 
MidAmerican Energy has a multi-year long-haul coal transportation agreement with BNSF Railway Company ("BNSF"), an affiliate company, for the delivery of coal to all of the MidAmerican Energy-operated coal-fueled generating facilities other than the George Neal Energy Center. Under this agreement, BNSF delivers coal directly to MidAmerican Energy's Walter Scott, Jr. Energy Center and to an interchange point with Canadian Pacific Railway Company for short-haul delivery to the Louisa Energy Center. MidAmerican Energy has a multi-year long-haul coal transportation agreement with Union Pacific Railroad Company for the delivery of coal to the George Neal Energy Center.
Nuclear
MidAmerican Energy is a 25% joint owner of Quad Cities Generating Station Units 1 and 2 ("Quad Cities Station"), a nuclear generating facility, which is currently licensed by the NRC for operation until December 14, 2032. Constellation Energy Generation, LLC ("Constellation Energy"), is the 75% joint owner and the operator of Quad Cities Station. Approximately one-third of the nuclear fuel assemblies in each reactor core at Quad Cities Station is replaced every 24 months. MidAmerican Energy has been advised by Constellation Energy that it does not anticipate it will have difficulty in obtaining the necessary uranium concentrates or conversion, enrichment or fabrication services to meet the nuclear fuel requirements of Quad Cities Station. In reaction to concerns about the profitability of Quad Cities Station and Constellation Energy's ability to continue its operation, in December 2016, Illinois passed legislation creating a zero emission standard, which went into effect June 1, 2017. The zero emission standard requires the Illinois Power Agency to purchase ZECs and recover the costs from certain ratepayers in Illinois, subject to certain limitations. Currently, Quad Cities is operating under agreements to provide Illinois load serving entities ZECs through June 1, 2027.
Natural Gas and Other
MidAmerican Energy uses natural gas and oil as fuel for intermediate and peak demand electric generation, igniter fuel, transmission support and standby purposes. These sources are presently in adequate supply and available to meet MidAmerican Energy's needs. 
Regional Transmission Organizations
MidAmerican Energy sells and purchases electricity and ancillary services related to its generation and load in wholesale markets pursuant to the tariffs in those markets. MidAmerican Energy participates predominantly in the MISO energy and ancillary service markets, which provide MidAmerican Energy with wholesale opportunities over a large market area. MidAmerican Energy can enter into wholesale bilateral transactions in addition to market activity related to its assets. MidAmerican Energy is also authorized to participate in the Southwest Power Pool, Inc. and PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. markets and can contract with several other utilities in the region. MidAmerican Energy utilizes financial swaps and physical fixed-price electricity sales and purchases contracts to reduce its exposure to electricity price volatility. 
MidAmerican Energy's decisions regarding additions to or reductions of its generation portfolio may be impacted by the MISO's minimum reserve margin requirement. The MISO requires each member to maintain a minimum reserve margin of its accredited generating capacity over its peak demand obligation based on the member's load forecast filed with the MISO each year. The MISO's reserve requirement was 8.7% for the summer of 2022. MidAmerican Energy's owned and contracted capacity accredited for the 2022-2023 MISO capacity auction was 5,591 MWs compared to a peak demand obligation of 5,078 MWs, or a reserve margin of 10.1%. Beginning with the 2023-2024 planning year, the MISO will implement a seasonal construct requiring each member to maintain a minimum seasonal reserve margin of its accredited generating capacity over its seasonal peak demand obligation based on the member's seasonal load forecast filed with the MISO each year. The reserve requirements for the 2023-2024 planning year will be 7.4% for summer 2023, 14.9% for fall 2023, 25.5% for winter 2023-2024 and 24.5% for spring 2024. Accredited capacity represents the amount of generation available to meet the requirements of MidAmerican Energy's retail customers and consists of MidAmerican Energy-owned generation, interruptible retail customer load, certain customer private generation that MidAmerican Energy is contractually allowed to dispatch and the net amount of capacity purchases and sales, excluding sales into the MISO annual capacity auction. Accredited capacity may vary significantly from the nominal capacity ratings, particularly for wind or solar facilities whose output is dependent upon energy resource availability at any given time. Additionally, the actual amount of generating capacity available at any time may be less than the accredited capacity due to regulatory restrictions, transmission constraints, fuel restrictions and generating units being temporarily out of service for inspection, maintenance, refueling, modifications or other reasons.
Transmission and Distribution
MidAmerican Energy's transmission and distribution systems included 4,600 circuit miles of transmission lines in four states, 25,400 circuit miles of distribution lines and 345 substations as of December 31, 2022. Electricity from MidAmerican Energy's generating facilities and purchased electricity is delivered to wholesale markets and its retail customers via the transmission facilities of MidAmerican Energy and others. MidAmerican Energy participates in the MISO capacity, energy and ancillary services markets as a transmission-owning member and, accordingly, operates its transmission assets at the direction of the MISO. The MISO manages its energy and ancillary service markets using reliability-constrained economic dispatch of the region's generation. For both the day-ahead and real-time (every five minutes) markets, the MISO analyzes generation commitments to provide market liquidity and transparent pricing while maintaining transmission system reliability by minimizing congestion and maximizing efficient energy transmission. Additionally, through its FERC-approved OATT, the MISO performs the role of transmission service provider throughout the MISO footprint and administers the long-term planning function. The MISO costs of the participants are shared among the participants through a number of mechanisms in accordance with the MISO tariff.
Regulated Natural Gas Operations
MidAmerican Energy is engaged in the distribution of natural gas to customers in its service territory and the related procurement, transportation and storage of natural gas for the benefit of those customers. MidAmerican Energy purchases natural gas from various suppliers and contracts with interstate natural gas pipelines for transportation of the gas to MidAmerican Energy's service territory and for storage and balancing services. MidAmerican Energy sells natural gas and delivery services to end-use customers on its distribution system; sells natural gas to other utilities, municipalities and energy marketing companies; and transports natural gas through its distribution system for end-use customers who have independently secured their supply of natural gas. During 2022, 54% of the total natural gas delivered through MidAmerican Energy's distribution system was associated with transportation service.
Natural gas property consists primarily of natural gas mains and service lines, meters, and related distribution equipment, including feeder lines to communities served from natural gas pipelines owned by others. The natural gas distribution facilities of MidAmerican Energy included 24,600 miles of natural gas main and service lines as of December 31, 2022.

Total Dths of transportation service (in thousands) | 102,827 | | 112,631 | | 110,263
Total average number of retail customers (in thousands) | 789 | | 781 | | 774 

(1)Commercial and industrial customers are classified primarily based on the nature of their business and natural gas usage. Commercial customers are non-residential customers that use natural gas principally for heating. Industrial customers are non-residential customers that use natural gas principally for their manufacturing processes.
(2)Wholesale sales are generally made to other utilities, municipalities and energy marketing companies for eventual resale to end-use customers.
There are seasonal variations in MidAmerican Energy's regulated natural gas business that are principally due to the use of natural gas for heating. Typically, 50-60% of MidAmerican Energy's regulated retail natural gas revenue is reported in the months of January, February, March and December.
On January 29, 2019, MidAmerican Energy recorded its all-time highest peak-day delivery through its distribution system of 1,319,361 Dths. This peak-day delivery consisted of 68% traditional retail sales service and 32% transportation service. MidAmerican Energy's 2022/2023 winter heating season preliminary peak-day delivery as of February 2, 2023, was 1,311,920 Dths, reached on December 22, 2022. This preliminary peak-day delivery consisted of 71% traditional retail sales service and 29% transportation service.
Natural Gas Supply and Capacity
MidAmerican Energy uses several strategies designed to maintain a reliable natural gas supply and reduce the impact of volatility in natural gas prices on its regulated retail natural gas customers. These strategies include the purchase of a geographically diverse supply portfolio from producers and third-party energy marketing companies, the use of interstate pipeline storage services and MidAmerican Energy's LNG peaking facilities, and the use of financial derivatives to fix the price on a portion of the anticipated natural gas requirements of MidAmerican Energy's customers. Refer to "General Regulation" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the PGAs.
MidAmerican Energy contracts for firm natural gas pipeline capacity to transport natural gas from key production areas and liquid market centers to its service territory through direct interconnects to the pipeline systems of several interstate natural gas pipeline systems, including Northern Natural Gas, an affiliate company. MidAmerican Energy has multiple pipeline interconnections into several larger markets within its distribution system. Multiple pipeline interconnections create competition among pipeline suppliers for transportation capacity to serve those markets, thus reducing costs. In addition, multiple pipeline interconnections increase delivery reliability and give MidAmerican Energy the ability to optimize delivery of the lowest cost supply from the various production areas and liquid market centers into these markets. Benefits to MidAmerican Energy's distribution system customers are shared among all jurisdictions through a consolidated PGA.
At times, the natural gas pipeline capacity available through MidAmerican Energy's firm capacity portfolio may exceed the requirements of retail customers on MidAmerican Energy's distribution system. Firm capacity in excess of MidAmerican Energy's system needs can be released to other companies to achieve optimum use of the available capacity. Past IUB and South Dakota Public Utilities Commission ("SDPUC") rulings have allowed MidAmerican Energy to retain 30% of the revenue on the resold capacity, with the remaining 70% being returned to customers through the PGAs.
MidAmerican Energy utilizes interstate pipeline natural gas storage services to meet retail customer requirements, manage fluctuations in demand due to changes in weather and other usage factors and manage variation in seasonal natural gas pricing. MidAmerican Energy typically withdraws natural gas from storage during the heating season when customer demand is historically at its peak and injects natural gas into storage during off-peak months when customer demand is historically lower. MidAmerican Energy also utilizes its three LNG facilities to meet peak day demands during the winter heating season. Interstate pipeline storage services and MidAmerican Energy's LNG facilities reduce dependence on natural gas purchases during the volatile winter heating season and can deliver a significant portion of MidAmerican Energy's anticipated retail sales requirements on a peak winter day. For MidAmerican Energy's 2022/2023 winter heating season preliminary peak-day of December 22, 2022, supply sources used to meet deliveries to traditional retail sales service customers included 54% from purchases delivered on interstate pipelines, 35% from interstate pipeline storage services and 11% from MidAmerican Energy's LNG facilities.
MidAmerican Energy attempts to optimize the value of its regulated transportation capacity, natural gas supply and interstate pipeline storage services by engaging in wholesale transactions. IUB and SDPUC rulings have allowed MidAmerican Energy to retain 50% of the respective jurisdictional margins earned on certain wholesale sales of natural gas, with the remaining 50% being returned to customers through the PGAs.
MidAmerican Energy is not aware of any factors that would cause material difficulties in meeting its anticipated retail customer demand under normal operating conditions for the foreseeable future.
Energy Efficiency Programs
MidAmerican Energy has provided a comprehensive set of demand- and energy-reduction programs to its Iowa electric and natural gas customers since 1990. The programs, collectively referred to as energy efficiency programs, are designed to reduce energy consumption and more effectively manage when energy is used, including management of seasonal peak loads. Current programs offer services to customers such as energy engineering audits and information on how to improve the efficiency of their homes and businesses. To assist customers in investing in energy efficiency, MidAmerican Energy offers rebates or incentives encouraging the purchase and installation of high-efficiency equipment such as lighting, heating and cooling equipment, weatherization, motors, process equipment and systems, as well as incentives for efficient construction. Incentives are also paid to residential customers who participate in the air conditioner load control program and nonresidential customers who participate in the nonresidential load management program. In Iowa, legislation passed in 2018 provides that projected cumulative average annual costs for a natural gas energy efficiency plan cannot exceed 1.5% of expected Iowa natural gas retail revenue and, for an electric demand response plan and separately for an electric energy efficiency plan other than demand response, cannot exceed 2.0% of expected annual Iowa electric retail revenue. Although subject to prudence reviews, state regulations allow for contemporaneous recovery of costs incurred for energy efficiency programs through state-specific energy efficiency service charges paid by all retail electric and natural gas customers. In 2022, $43 million was expensed for MidAmerican Energy's energy efficiency programs, which resulted in estimated first-year energy savings of 133,000 MWhs of electricity and 174,000 Dths of natural gas and an estimated peak load reduction of 384 MWs of electricity and 2,444 Dths per day of natural gas.

Variations in weather, economic conditions, particularly for gaming, mining and wholesale customers and various conservation, energy efficiency and private generation measures and programs can impact customer energy requirements. Wholesale sales are impacted by market prices for energy relative to the incremental cost to generate power. 
There are seasonal variations in the Nevada Utilities' electric business that are principally related to weather and the related use of electricity for air conditioning. Typically, 48-52% of Nevada Power's and 37-40% of Sierra Pacific's regulated electric revenue is reported in the months of June through September.
The annual hourly peak customer demand on the Nevada Utilities' electric systems occurs as a result of air conditioning use during the cooling season. Peak demand represents the highest demand on a given day and at a given hour. On July 11, 2022, customer usage of electricity caused an hourly peak demand of 6,033 MWs on Nevada Power's electric system, which is 267 MWs less than the record hourly peak demand of 6,300 MWs set July 9, 2021. On July 27, 2022, customer usage of electricity caused an hourly peak demand of 1,962 MWs on Sierra Pacific's electric system, which is 144 MWs less than the record hourly peak demand of 2,106 MWs set July 12, 2021.

(1) All or some of the renewable energy attributes associated with generation from these sources may be: (a) used in future years to comply with RPS or other regulatory requirements, (b) sold to third parties in the form of RECs or other environmental commodities, or (c) excluded from energy purchased.
The Nevada Utilities are required to have resources available to continuously meet their customer needs and reliably operate their electric systems. The percentage of the Nevada Utilities' energy supplied by energy source varies from year-to-year and is subject to numerous operational and economic factors such as planned and unplanned outages; fuel commodity prices; fuel transportation costs; weather; environmental considerations; transmission constraints; and wholesale market prices of electricity. The Nevada Utilities evaluate these factors continuously in order to facilitate economic dispatch of their generating facilities. When factors for one energy source are less favorable, the Nevada Utilities place more reliance on other energy sources. As long as the Nevada Utilities' purchases are deemed prudent by the PUCN, through their annual prudency review, the Nevada Utilities are permitted to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power. The Nevada Utilities also have the ability to reset quarterly the BTERs, with PUCN approval, based on the last 12 months fuel costs and purchased power and to reset quarterly DEAA.
The Nevada Utilities have adopted an approach to managing the energy supply function that has three primary elements. The first element is a set of management guidelines for procuring and optimizing the supply portfolio that is consistent with the requirements of a load serving entity with a full requirements obligation, and with the growth of private generation serving a small but growing group of customers with partial requirements. The second element is an energy risk management and control approach that ensures clear separation of roles between the day-to-day management of risks and compliance monitoring and control and ensures clear distinction between policy setting (or planning) and execution. Lastly, the Nevada Utilities pursue a process of ongoing regulatory involvement and acknowledgment of the resource portfolio management plans.
The Nevada Utilities have entered into multiple long-term power purchase contracts (three or more years) with suppliers that generate electricity utilizing renewable resources and natural gas. Nevada Power has entered into contracts with a total capacity of 3,522 MWs with contract termination dates ranging from 2023 to 2067. Included in these contracts are 3,352 MWs of capacity from renewable energy, of which 1,818 MWs of capacity are under development or construction and not currently available. Sierra Pacific has entered into contracts with a total capacity of 985 MWs with contract termination dates ranging from 2023 to 2049. Included in these contracts are 973 MWs of capacity from renewable energy, of which 25 MWs of capacity are under development or construction and not currently available.
The Nevada Utilities manage certain risks relating to their supply of electricity and fuel requirements by entering into various contracts, which may be accounted for as derivatives, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements. Refer to NV Energy's "General Regulation" section in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of energy cost recovery by jurisdiction and Nevada Power's Item 7A and Sierra Pacific's Item 7A in this Form 10-K for a discussion of commodity price risk and derivative contracts.
Natural Gas
The Nevada Utilities rely on indexed physical gas purchases for the majority of natural gas needed to operate their generating facilities. To secure natural gas supplies for the generating facilities, the Nevada Utilities execute purchases pursuant to a PUCN approved four season laddering strategy. In 2022, natural gas supply net purchases averaged 299,831 and 149,418 Dths per day with the winter period contracts averaging 256,039 and 120,985 Dths per day and the summer period contracts averaging 330,731 and 189,714 Dths per day for Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific, respectively. The Nevada Utilities believe supplies from these sources are presently adequate and available to meet its needs.
The Nevada Utilities contract for firm natural gas pipeline capacity to transport natural gas from production areas to their service territory through direct interconnects to the pipeline systems of several interstate natural gas pipeline systems, including Nevada Power who contracts with Kern River, an affiliated company. Sierra Pacific utilizes natural gas storage contracted from interstate pipelines to meet retail customer requirements and to manage the daily changes in demand due to changes in weather and other usage factors. The stored natural gas is typically replaced during off-peak months when the demand for natural gas is historically lower than during the heating season. 
Coal
Sierra Pacific relies on spot market solicitations for coal supplies and will regularly monitor the western coal market for opportunities to meet these needs. Sierra Pacific has a transportation services contract with Union Pacific Railroad Company to ship coal from various origins in central Utah, western Colorado and Wyoming that expires December 31, 2025. Sierra Pacific has a coal purchase agreement that extends through December 2023. The Valmy generating facility, Sierra Pacific's remaining facility requiring coal, has an approved retirement date of December 2025. Nevada Power has no coal requirements.
Energy Imbalance Market
The Nevada Utilities participate in the EIM operated by the California ISO, which reduces costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources, more effectively integrates renewables and enhances reliability through improved situational awareness and responsiveness. The EIM expands the real-time component of the California ISO's market technology to optimize and balance electricity supply and demand every five minutes across the EIM footprint. The EIM is voluntary and available to all balancing authorities in the western U.S. EIM market participants submit bids to the California ISO market operator before each hour for each generating resource they choose to be dispatched by the market. Each bid is comprised of a dispatchable operating range, ramp rate and prices across the operating range. The California ISO market operator uses sophisticated technology to select the least-cost resources to meet demand and send simultaneous dispatch signals to every participating generator across the EIM footprint every five minutes. In addition to generation resource bids, the California ISO market operator also receives continuous real-time updates of the transmission grid network, meteorological and load forecast information that it uses to optimize dispatch instructions. Outside the EIM footprint, utilities in the western U.S. do not utilize comparable technology and are largely limited to transactions within the borders of their balancing authority area to balance supply and demand intra-hour using a combination of manual and automated dispatch. The EIM delivers customer benefits by leveraging automation and resource diversity to result in more efficient dispatch, more effective integration of renewables and improved situational awareness. Benefits are expected to increase further with renewable resource expansion and as more entities join the EIM bringing incremental diversity. 
Transmission and Distribution
The Nevada Utilities' transmission system is part of the Western Interconnection, a regional grid in the U.S. The Western Interconnection includes the interconnected transmission systems of 14 western states, two Canadian provinces and parts of Mexico. The Nevada Utilities' transmission system, together with contractual rights on other transmission systems, enables the Nevada Utilities to integrate and access generation resources to meet their customer load requirements. Nevada Power's transmission and distribution systems included approximately 1,900 miles of transmission lines, 14,000 miles of distribution lines and 220 substations as of December 31, 2022. Sierra Pacific's transmission and distribution systems included approximately 4,200 miles of transmission lines, 9,600 miles of distribution lines and 210 substations as of December 31, 2022.
ON Line is a 231-mile, 500-kV transmission line connecting Nevada Power's and Sierra Pacific's service territories. ON Line provides the ability to jointly dispatch energy throughout Nevada and provide access to renewable energy resources in parts of northern and eastern Nevada, which enhances the Nevada Utilities' ability to manage and optimize their generating facilities. ON Line provides between 600 MWs northbound and 900 MWs southbound of transfer capability with interconnection between the Robinson Summit substation on the Sierra Pacific system and the Harry Allen substation on the Nevada Power system. ON Line was a joint project between the Nevada Utilities and Great Basin Transmission, LLC. The Nevada Utilities own a 25% interest in ON Line and have entered into a long-term transmission use agreement with Great Basin Transmission, LLC for its 75% interest in ON Line until 2054. The Nevada Utilities share of its 25% interest in ON Line and the long-term transmission use agreement is split 75% for Nevada Power and 25% for Sierra Pacific.
The PUCN has approved the Nevada Utilities' Greenlink Nevada transmission expansion program, with an estimated cost of approximately $2.6 billion, which builds a foundation for the Nevada Utilities to accommodate existing and future transmission network customers, increase transmission system reliability, create access to diversified renewable resources, facilitate development of existing designated solar energy zones, facilitate conventional generation retirement and achieve Nevada's carbon reduction and eventual net-zero objectives. The Greenlink program consists of a 350-mile, 525-kV transmission line, known as Greenlink West, connecting the Ft. Churchill substation to the Northwest substation to the Harry Allen substation; a 235-mile, 525-kV transmission line, known as Greenlink North, connecting the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Robinson Summit substation; a 46-mile, 345-kV transmission line from the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Mira Loma substations; and a 38-mile, 345-kV transmission line from the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Robinson Summit substations. The Greenlink program will be constructed in stages that are estimated to be placed in-service between December 2026 and December 2028. The Nevada Utilities will jointly own and operate the Greenlink transmission lines. Through December 31, 2022, $51 million had been spent.
Future Generation, Conservation and Energy Efficiency
Energy Supply Planning
Within the energy supply planning process, there are four key components covering different time frames:
•IRPs are filed by the Nevada Utilities for approval by the PUCN every three years and the Nevada Utilities may, as necessary, file amendments to their IRPs. IRPs are prepared in compliance with Nevada laws and regulations and cover a 20-year period. Nevada law governing the IRP process was modified in 2017 and now requires joint filings by Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific. IRPs develop a comprehensive, integrated plan that considers customer energy requirements and propose the resources to meet those requirements in a manner that is consistent with prevailing market fundamentals. The ultimate goal of the IRPs is to balance the objectives of minimizing costs and reducing volatility while reliably meeting the electric needs of the Nevada Utilities' customers. Costs incurred to complete projects approved through the IRP process still remain subject to review for reasonableness by the PUCN.
•Energy Supply Plans ("ESP") are filed with the PUCN for approval and operate in conjunction with the PUCN-approved 20-year IRP. The ESP has a one- to three-year planning horizon and is an intermediate-term resource procurement and risk management plan that establishes the supply portfolio strategies within which intermediate-term resource requirements will be met with PUCN approval required for executing contracts of longer than three years.
•Distributed Resource Plans ("DRP") are filed with the PUCN for approval and operate in conjunction with the PUCN-approved 20-year IRP. The DRP establishes a formal process to aid in the cost-effective integration of distributed resources into the Nevada Utilities' distribution and transmission process and ultimately the NV Energy utilities' electricity grid.
•Action plans are filed with the PUCN for approval and operate in conjunction with the PUCN-approved 20-year IRP and PUCN-approved ESP. The action plan establishes tactical execution activities with a three-year focus.
In June 2021, the Nevada Utilities filed a joint application for approval of their 2022-2041 Triennial IRP, 2022-2024 ESP and 2022-2024 Action Plan. As part of the filing, the Nevada Utilities requested approval of 600 MWs of solar photovoltaic generating resources with 480 MWs of battery energy storage capacity, three battery energy storage projects with 66 MWs of capacity, the acquisition of one existing solar photovoltaic generating facility with 19.5 MWs of capacity that is currently leased to Sierra Pacific, and network upgrades associated with the new renewable energy projects. In September 2021, a hearing was held for the generation upgrades portion of the application, which resulted in an order approving that portion of the joint IRP. The Nevada Utilities filed a partial party stipulation resolving all issues related to the ESP, load forecast and fuel and purchased power price portions of the joint IRP. In October 2021, the Nevada Utilities filed a corrected stipulation, which was approved by the PUCN. In November 2021, a hearing was conducted for the remaining portions of the joint IRP and in December 2021, the PUCN issued an order granting in part and denying in part. The PUCN approved the construction of the 600 MWs of solar photovoltaic generating resources with 480 MWs of battery energy storage capacity, the acquisition of the existing solar photovoltaic generating facility and the network upgrade, among other items. However, the three additional battery energy storage projects were deferred for approval in future plans and the PUCN declined to retire Valmy 1 early and made adjustments to the approved budget for developing and conducting the distributed resource energy trial. 
In September 2021, in compliance with Senate Bill ("SB") 448, the Nevada Utilities filed an amendment to the 2021 joint IRP for approval of their Transmission Infrastructure for a Clean Energy Economy Plan that sets forth a plan for the construction of certain high-voltage transmission infrastructure which includes a 235-mile, 525-kV transmission line known as Greenlink North and a 32-mile, 525-kV transmission segment of Greenlink West. In January 2022, the Nevada Utilities reached a settlement with all the intervening parties and presented a stipulation before the PUCN related to the Greenlink transmission project. The settlement allows for the Nevada Utilities to receive approval to construct the Greenlink North project and the remaining segment of the Greenlink West project. The settlement allows the Nevada Utilities to designate these projects as critical facilities that will allow the Nevada Utilities to propose financial incentives in future proceedings. Potential financial incentives include construction work in process included in rate base and the ability to use regulatory asset accounting treatment. The Nevada Utilities agreed not to seek an enhanced return on investment at the state level as part of the settlement. The stipulation was approved by the PUCN in January 2022.
In March 2022, the Nevada Utilities filed the first amendment to the 2021 joint IRP for approval of the battery energy storage system with 220 MWs of capacity; a $3.5 million funding request to further study and perform due diligence on the pumped storage hydro project with a capacity of 1,000 MW, an addition of the geothermal facility purchase power agreement for 25 MW of renewable energy, peak firing project upgrades at the existing generating units to yield 48 MW of additional on-peak generation thermal energy storage project to increase the generating station's peak capacity by 18 MW, and network upgrades associated with the battery energy storage system. In April 2022, a partial stipulation was filed to remedy the redaction of the purchase power agreement pricing and in June 2022, the Nevada Utilities filed a settlement stipulation resolving all remaining issues. The PUCN approved the stipulation in July 2022.
In compliance with SB 448, the Nevada Utilities filed their second and third amendments to the 2021 joint IRP in July and September 2022, respectively. The Nevada Utilities requested an approval to amend the Demand Side Plan for the action period for 2022-2024 in July's filing and requested in September an approval of a DRP amendment to implement the state's first Transportation Electrification Plan ("TEP") and approve proposed tariffs and schedules to implement the TEP. In November 2022, the Nevada Utilities filed an all-party settlement stipulation of the second amendment to the IRP, resolving all issues. A hearing related to the application for approval of the third amendment was held in February 2023.
In November 2022, the Nevada Utilities filed their fourth amendment to the 2021 joint IRP requesting an approval of a generation update to the Supply Plan, an addition of 400 MW of peaking combustion turbines, a 120 MW geothermal portfolio long-term power purchase agreement, a 20 MW new geothermal technology long-term purchase power agreement, and a 200 MW grid-tied battery energy storage system at the Valmy generating facility as well as necessary transmission upgrades. An order is expected in the first half of 2023.
Energy Efficiency Programs
The Nevada Utilities have provided a comprehensive set of energy efficiency, demand response and conservation programs to their Nevada electric customers. The programs are designed to reduce energy consumption and more effectively manage when energy is used, including management of seasonal peak loads. Current programs offer services to customers such as energy audits and customer education and awareness efforts that provide information on how to improve the efficiency of their homes and businesses. To assist customers in investing in energy efficiency, the Nevada Utilities have offered rebates or incentives encouraging the purchase and installation of high-efficiency equipment such as lighting, heating and cooling equipment, weatherization, motors, process equipment and systems, as well as incentives for efficient construction. Incentives are also paid to residential customers who participate in the air conditioner load control program and nonresidential customers who participate in the nonresidential load management program. Energy efficiency program costs are recovered through annual rates set by the PUCN and adjusted based on the Nevada Utilities' annual filing to recover current program costs and any over or under collections from the prior filing, subject to prudence review. During 2022, Nevada Power spent $34 million on energy efficiency programs, resulting in an estimated 205,974 MWhs of electric energy savings and an estimated 179 MWs of electric peak load management. During 2022, Sierra Pacific spent $8 million on energy efficiency programs, resulting in an estimated 40,539 MWhs of electric energy savings and an estimated 23 MWs of electric peak load management.
Regulated Natural Gas Operations
Sierra Pacific is engaged in the distribution of natural gas to customers in its service territory and the related procurement, transportation and storage of natural gas for the benefit of those customers. Sierra Pacific purchases natural gas from various suppliers and contracts with interstate natural gas pipelines for transportation of the natural gas from the production areas to Sierra Pacific's service territory and for storage services to manage fluctuations in system demand and seasonal pricing. Sierra Pacific sells natural gas and delivery services to end-use customers on its distribution system; sells natural gas to other utilities, municipalities and energy marketing companies; and transports natural gas through its distribution system for a number of end-use customers who have independently secured their supply of natural gas. During 2022, 7% of the total natural gas delivered through Sierra Pacific's distribution system was for transportation service.
Natural gas property consists primarily of natural gas mains and service lines, meters, and related distribution equipment, including feeder lines to communities served from natural gas pipelines owned by others. The natural gas distribution facilities of Sierra Pacific included 3,600 miles of natural gas mains and service lines as of December 31, 2022.
Customer Usage and Seasonality
The percentages of natural gas sold to Sierra Pacific's retail and wholesale customers by class of customer, total Dths of natural gas sold, total Dths of transportation service and the average number of retail customers for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020 
Residential | 55 | % | | 53 | % | 56 | %
Commercial(1) | 28 | | | 28 | | 28 | 
Industrial(1) | 11 | | | 10 | | 10 | 
Total retail | 94 | | | 91 | | 94 | 
Wholesale(2) | 6 | | | 9 | | 6 | 
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %
Total Dths of natural gas sold (in thousands) | 20,622 | | 20,050 | | 18,622
Total Dths of transportation service (in thousands) | 1,576 | | 1,850 | | 2,217 
Total average number of retail customers (in thousands) | 180 | | 177 | | 174 

(1)Commercial and industrial customers are classified primarily based on the nature of their business and natural gas usage. Commercial customers are non-residential customers with monthly gas usage less than 12,000 therms during five consecutive winter months. Industrial customers are non-residential customers that use natural gas in excess of 12,000 therms during one or more winter months.
(2)Wholesale sales are generally made to other utilities, municipalities and energy marketing companies for eventual resale to end-use customers.
There are seasonal variations in Sierra Pacific's regulated natural gas business that are principally due to the use of natural gas for heating. Typically, 47-56% of Sierra Pacific's regulated natural gas revenue is reported in the months of December through March.
On December 18, 2022, Sierra Pacific recorded its highest peak-day natural gas delivery of 152,157 Dths, which is 11,417 Dths less than the record peak-day delivery of 163,574 Dths set on December 9, 2013. This peak-day delivery consisted of 96% traditional retail sales service and 4% transportation service.
Fuel Supply and Capacity
The purchase of natural gas for Sierra Pacific's regulated natural gas operations is done in combination with the purchase of natural gas for Sierra Pacific's regulated electric operations. In response to energy supply challenges, Sierra Pacific has adopted an approach to managing the energy supply function that has three primary elements, as discussed earlier under Generating Facilities and Fuel Supply. Similar to Sierra Pacific's regulated electric operations, as long as Sierra Pacific's purchases of natural gas are deemed prudent by the PUCN, through its annual prudency review, Sierra Pacific is permitted to recover the cost of natural gas. Sierra Pacific also has the ability, with PUCN approval, to reset quarterly the BTERs, based on the last 12 months fuel costs, and to reset quarterly DEAA.
Human Capital
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, Nevada Power had approximately 1,400 employees, of which approximately 700 were covered by a union contract with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
As of December 31, 2022, Sierra Pacific had approximately 1,000 employees, of which approximately 500 were covered by a union contract with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
For more information regarding Nevada Power's and Sierra Pacific's human capital disclosures, refer to Item 1. Business - General section of this Form 10-K.
NORTHERN POWERGRID
Northern Powergrid, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BHE, is a holding company which owns two companies that distribute electricity in Great Britain, Northern Powergrid (Northeast) plc and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc. In addition to the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies, Northern Powergrid also owns a meter asset rental business that leases meters to energy suppliers in the United Kingdom, an engineering contracting business that provides electrical infrastructure contracting services primarily to third parties, a hydrocarbon exploration and development business that is focused on developing integrated upstream gas projects in Europe and Australia and ownership interests in two solar generation facilities in Australia having a total net owned capacity of 260 MWs.
The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies serve 4.0 million end-users and operate in the north-east of England from North Northumberland through Tyne and Wear, County Durham and Yorkshire to North Lincolnshire, an area covering 10,000 square miles. The principal function of the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies is to build, maintain and operate the electricity distribution network through which the end-user receives a supply of electricity. 
The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies receive electricity from the national grid transmission system and from generators that are directly connected to the distribution network and distribute it to end-users' premises using their networks of transformers, switchgear and distribution lines and cables. Substantially all of the end-users in the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' distribution service areas are directly or indirectly connected to the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' networks and electricity can only be delivered to these end-users through their distribution systems, thus providing the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies with distribution volumes that are relatively stable from year to year. The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies charge fees for the use of their distribution systems to the suppliers of electricity.
The suppliers purchase electricity from generators, sell the electricity to end-user customers and use the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' distribution networks pursuant to an industry standard "Distribution Connection and Use of System Agreement." During 2022, E.ON and certain of its affiliates and British Gas Trading Limited represented 22% and 14%, respectively, of the total combined distribution revenue of the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies. Variations in demand from end-users can affect the revenues that are received by the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies in any year, but such variations have no effect on the total revenue that the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies are allowed to recover in a price control period. Under- or over-recoveries against price-controlled revenues are carried forward into prices for future years.
During 2021, 28 suppliers went bankrupt due to rising wholesale prices, particularly for natural gas. This resulted in energy supply costs being higher than the Ofgem set variable tariff price cap that can be charged to customers. Any distribution use of system bad debts suffered by Northern Powergrid is recoverable in future distribution use of systems revenue.
The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' combined service territory features a diverse economy with no dominant sector. The mix of rural, agricultural, urban and industrial areas covers a broad customer base ranging from domestic usage through farming and retail to major industry including automotives, chemicals, mining, steelmaking and offshore marine construction. The industry within the area is concentrated around the principal centers of Newcastle, Middlesbrough, Sheffield and Leeds.
The price-controlled revenue of the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies is set out in the special conditions of the licenses of those companies. The licenses are enforced by the regulator, GEMA, through Ofgem, and limit increases to allowed revenues (or may require decreases) based upon the rate of inflation, other specified factors and other regulatory action. The current electricity distribution price control became effective April 1, 2015 and will continue through March 31, 2023. Ofgem has set the next price control for the five-year period from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2028. The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies published and filed their business plans for the next price control period with Ofgem in December 2021 with final determinations published in November 2022. The remaining necessary step for this price control to be effective is the statutory modification of the license, which was published by Ofgem on February 3, 2023 and will become effective on April 1, 2023.
GWhs and percentages of electricity distributed to the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' end-users and the total number of end-users as of and for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

 | 2022 | 2021 | | 2020
GWhs distributed: | | | | | | | | 
Residential | 11,880 | | 37 | % | | 13,334 | 39 | % | 12,946 | 40 | %
Commercial | 3,737 | | 12 | | | 3,643 | 11 | | 3,459 | 10 | 
Industrial | 16,239 | | 50 | | | 16,424 | 49 | | 15,917 | 49 | 
Other | 301 | | 1 | | | 318 | 1 | | 359 | 1 | 
 | 32,157 | | 100 | % | | 33,719 | 100 | % | 32,681 | 100 | %
Number of end-users (in thousands): | 3,953 | | | | 3,941 | | | 3,934 | 

As of December 31, 2022, the combined electricity distribution network of the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies included approximately 17,000 miles of overhead lines, 43,400 miles of underground cables and 810 major substations.
BHE PIPELINE GROUP (EASTERN ENERGY GAS AND EGTS)
The BHE Pipeline Group consists of BHE GT&S, Northern Natural Gas and Kern River, each an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BHE. The BHE Pipeline Group operates approximately 21,200 miles of pipeline with a design capacity of approximately 21.1 Bcf of natural gas per day, transported approximately 15% of the total natural gas consumed in the U.S. during 2022 and owns assets in 27 states. The BHE Pipeline Group also operates 22 natural gas storage facilities with a total working gas capacity of 515.6 Bcf and an LNG export, import and storage facility.
The Pipeline Companies compete with other pipelines on the basis of cost, flexibility, reliability of service and overall customer service, with the customer's decision being made primarily on the basis of delivered price, which includes both the natural gas commodity cost and transportation costs. The Pipeline Companies also compete with midstream operators and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services to meet customer needs. Natural gas competes with alternative energy sources, including coal, nuclear energy, wind, geothermal, solar and fuel oil and the electricity generated from these alternative energy sources. The Pipeline Companies generate a substantial portion of their revenue from long-term firm contracts for transportation and storage services and are therefore insulated from competitive factors during the terms of the contracts. When these long-term contracts expire, the Pipeline Companies face competitive pressures from other natural gas pipeline facilities.
Subject to regulatory requirements, the Pipeline Companies attempt to recontract or remarket capacity at the maximum rates allowed under their tariffs, although at times the Pipeline Companies discount these rates to remain competitive. Historically, the Pipeline Companies have been able to provide competitively priced services because of access to a variety of relatively low cost supply basins, cost control measures and the relatively high level of firm entitlement that is sold on a seasonal and annual basis, which lowers the per unit cost of transportation. To date, the Pipeline Companies have avoided significant pipeline system bypasses.
BHE GT&S
BHE GT&S' operations, through its ownership of Eastern Energy Gas, includes three interstate natural gas pipeline systems, one of the nation's largest underground natural gas storage systems and one LNG export, import and storage facility. BHE GT&S' operations also include smaller LNG facilities, a field service company, and a gathering and processing company.
Eastern Energy Gas' principal subsidiaries are EGTS and Carolina Gas Transmission, LLC ("CGT"). EGTS' operations include natural gas transmission and storage pipelines located in Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. EGTS also operates one of the nation's largest underground natural gas storage systems located in New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. CGT's operations include an interstate natural gas pipeline system located in South Carolina and southeastern Georgia. Eastern Energy Gas also owns a 50% equity interest in Iroquois Gas Transmission System L.P. ("Iroquois"). Iroquois owns and operates an interstate natural gas pipeline located in the states of New York and Connecticut.
Eastern Energy Gas' LNG operations involve the export, import and storage of LNG at the Cove Point LNG Facility that is owned by Cove Point, located in Maryland, as well as the transmission of regasified LNG to the interstate pipeline grid and mid-Atlantic markets and the liquefaction of natural gas for export as LNG. Cove Point's LNG Facility has an operational peak regasification daily send-out capacity of approximately 1.8 million Dth and an aggregate LNG storage capacity of approximately 14.6 billions of cubic feet equivalent ("Bcfe"). In addition, Cove Point has a small liquefier that has the potential to produce approximately 15,000 Dth/day. The Liquefaction Facility consists of one LNG train with a nameplate outlet capacity of 5.25 million tonnes per annum ("Mtpa"). Cove Point has authorization from the DOE to export up to 0.77 Bcfe/day (approximately 5.75 Mtpa) should the Liquefaction Facility perform better than expected. Cove Point's 36-inch diameter underground interstate natural gas pipelines are approximately 139 miles, with interconnections to Transcontinental Gas Pipeline, LLC in Fairfax County, Virginia, and with Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC and EGTS in Loudoun County, Virginia. Eastern Energy Gas operates, as the general partner, and owns a 25% limited partnership interest in the Cove Point LNG export, import and storage facility. BHE GT&S also operates and has ownership interests in three smaller LNG facilities in Alabama, Florida and Pennsylvania.
In total, Eastern Energy Gas operates approximately 5,400 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines, of which approximately 5,200 miles are owned by Eastern Energy Gas, with a design capacity of 12.6 Bcf per day as well as approximately 100 miles of natural gas liquids pipelines operated by BHE GT&S. EGTS operates approximately 3,900 miles of natural gas transmission and storage pipelines with a design capacity of 9.9 Bcf per day. EGTS also operates 17 underground storage fields with a total working gas capacity of approximately 420 Bcf, of which approximately 307 Bcf relates to natural gas storage field capacity that EGTS owns. BHE GT&S' pipeline system is configured with approximately 365 active receipt and delivery points. In 2022, BHE GT&S delivered over 2.0 trillion cubic feet ("Tcf") of natural gas to its customers.
BHE GT&S' natural gas transmission and storage earnings primarily result from rates established by FERC. Revenues derived from BHE GT&S' pipeline operations are primarily from reservation charges for firm transmission and storage services as provided for in their FERC-approved tariffs. Reservation charges are required to be paid regardless of volumes transported or stored. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on their capital investments. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 86% of BHE GT&S' transmission capacity is subscribed, including 81% under long-term contracts and 5% on a year-to-year basis, and approximately 97% of EGTS' storage capacity is subscribed with long-term contracts. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining contract term for Eastern Energy Gas' and EGTS' firm transmission contracts is seven years and six years, respectively, and EGTS' storage contracts is four years. Additionally, BHE GT&S receives revenue from firm fee-based contractual arrangements, including negotiated rates, for certain pipeline transmission and LNG storage and terminal services. Variability in BHE GT&S' earnings results from changes in operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as changes in rates and the demand for services, which are dependent on weather, changes in commodity prices and the economy.
BHE GT&S' operating revenue for the year ended December 31 was as follows (in millions):

 | 2022 | | 2021
Transmission | $ | 849 | | | 35 | % | | $ | 772 | | 36 | %
LNG | 790 | | | 33 | | | 704 | | | 32
Storage | 316 | | | 13 | | | 251 | | | 12
Gas, liquids and other sales | 447 | | | 19 | | | 433 | | | 20
Total operating revenue | $ | 2,402 | | | 100 | % | | $ | 2,160 | | 100 | %

Except for quantities of natural gas owned and managed for operational and system balancing purposes, BHE GT&S does not own the natural gas that is transported through its system. 
During 2022, BHE GT&S had two customers that each accounted for greater than 10% of its operating revenue and its 10 largest customers accounted for 45% of its total operating revenue. BHE GT&S has agreements with terms through 2038 to retain the majority of its two largest customers' volumes. The loss of any of these significant customers, if not replaced, could have a material adverse effect on BHE GT&S.
Human Capital

Northern Natural Gas
Northern Natural Gas owns the largest interstate natural gas pipeline system in the U.S., as measured by pipeline miles, which reaches from west Texas to Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Northern Natural Gas primarily transports and stores natural gas for utilities, municipalities, gas marketing companies and industrial and commercial users. Northern Natural Gas' pipeline system consists of two commercial segments. Its traditional end-use and distribution market area in the northern part of its system, referred to as the Market Area, includes points in Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Michigan and Illinois. Its natural gas supply and delivery service area in the southern part of its system, referred to as the Field Area, includes points in Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. The Market Area and Field Area are separated at a Demarcation Point ("Demarc"). Northern Natural Gas' pipeline system consists of 14,400 miles of natural gas pipelines, including 5,900 miles of mainline transmission pipelines and 8,500 miles of branch and lateral pipelines, with a Market Area design capacity of 6.3 Bcf per day, a Field Area delivery capacity of 1.7 Bcf per day to the Market Area and 1.4 Bcf per day to the West Texas area and 95.6 Bcf of working gas capacity in five storage facilities. Northern Natural Gas' pipeline system is configured with approximately 2,215 active receipt and delivery points which are integrated with the facilities of LDCs. Many of Northern Natural Gas' LDC customers are part of combined utilities that also use natural gas as a fuel source for electric generation. Northern Natural Gas delivered over 1.4 Tcf of natural gas to its customers in 2022. 
Northern Natural Gas' transportation rates and most of its storage rates are cost-based. These rates are designed to provide Northern Natural Gas with an opportunity to recover its costs of providing services and earn a reasonable return on its investments. Substantially all of Northern Natural Gas' Market Area transportation revenue is generated from reservation charges, with the balance from usage charges. Most of Northern Natural Gas' transportation capacity in the Market Area is committed to customers under firm transportation contracts, where customers pay Northern Natural Gas a monthly reservation charge for the right to transport natural gas through Northern Natural Gas' system. Reservation charges are required to be paid regardless of volumes transported or stored. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 74% of Northern Natural Gas' customers' entitlement in the Market Area have terms beyond 2024 and approximately 61% beyond 2026. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining contract term for Northern Natural Gas' Market Area firm transportation contracts is six years. Northern Natural Gas' Field Area customers consist primarily of energy marketing companies, midstream companies and power generators that are connected to Northern Natural Gas' system in Texas and New Mexico that are contracted on a long-term basis with a weighted average remaining contract term of five years. Northern Natural Gas' storage services are provided through the operation of one underground natural gas storage field in Iowa and two underground natural gas storage facilities in Kansas. Additionally, Northern Natural Gas has two LNG storage peaking units, one in Iowa and one in Minnesota, that support its transportation service. The three underground natural gas storage facilities and two LNG storage peaking units have a total working gas capacity of over 95.6 Bcf and over 2.2 Bcf per day of peak delivery capability. The average remaining contract term for firm storage contracts is five years.
Northern Natural Gas' operating revenue for the years ended December 31 was as follows (in millions):

 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Transportation: | | | | | | | | | | 
Market Area | $ | 688 | | | 66 | % | | $ | 658 | | 61 | % | $ | 633 | 65 | %
Field Area | 210 | | | 22 | | | 177 | | | 17 | | 226 | | 24 
Total transportation | 898 | | | 88 | | | 835 | | | 78 | | 859 | | 89 
Storage | 97 | | | 9 | | | 94 | | | 9 | | 91 | | 9 
Total transportation and storage revenue | 995 | | | 97 | | | 929 | | | 87 | | 950 | | 98 
Gas, liquids and other sales | 28 | | | 3 | | | 143 | | | 13 | | 18 | | 2 
Total operating revenue | $ | 1,023 | | | 100 | % | | $ | 1,072 | | 100 | % | $ | 968 | 100 | %

Except for quantities of natural gas owned and managed for operational and system balancing purposes, Northern Natural Gas does not own the natural gas that is transported through its system. The sale of natural gas for operational and system balancing purposes accounts for the majority of the remaining operating revenue. 
During 2022, Northern Natural Gas had two customers that each accounted for greater than 10% of its transportation and storage revenue and its 10 largest customers accounted for 63% of its system-wide transportation and storage revenue. Northern Natural Gas has agreements with terms through 2027 and 2034 to retain the majority of its two largest customers' volumes. The loss of either of these significant customers, if not replaced, could have a material adverse effect on Northern Natural Gas.
Kern River
Kern River owns an interstate natural gas pipeline system that extends from supply areas in the Rocky Mountains to consuming markets in Utah, Nevada and California. Kern River operates 1,400 miles of mainline natural gas pipelines, with a year-round design capacity of 2,166,575 Dths, or 2.2 Bcf, per day. Additional seasonal design capacity (Bell-Curve) is contracted in all months except July, August and September. The mainline pipeline extends from the system's point of origination near Opal, Wyoming, through the Central Rocky Mountains to Daggett, California. The mainline section consists of 1,300 miles of 36-inch diameter pipeline and 100 miles of various laterals that connect to the mainline. Kern River primarily transports and stores natural gas for utilities, municipalities, gas marketing companies, industrial and commercial users.
Kern River's rates are designed to provide Kern River with an opportunity to recover its costs of providing services and earn a reasonable return on its investments and are based on a levelized rate design with recovery of 70% of the original investment during the initial long-term contracts ("Period One rates"). After expiration of the initial term, eligible customers have the option to elect service at rates ("Period Two rates") that are lower than Period One rates because they are designed to recover the remaining 30% of the original investment. To the extent that eligible customers do not contract for service at Period Two rates, the volumes are turned back to Kern River, and it resells capacity at market rates for varying terms. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 87% of Kern River's design capacity, including seasonal bell curve, totaled 2,345,381 Dths per day and is contracted pursuant to long-term firm natural gas transportation service agreements, whereby Kern River receives natural gas on behalf of customers at designated receipt points and transports the natural gas on a firm basis to designated delivery points. In return for this service, each customer pays Kern River a fixed monthly reservation fee based on each customer's maximum daily quantity, which represents nearly 81% of total operating revenue, and a commodity charge based on the actual amount of natural gas transported pursuant to its long-term firm natural gas transportation service agreements and Kern River's tariff. These long-term firm natural gas transportation service agreements expire between February 2023 and October 2036 and have a weighted-average remaining contract term of over eight years. As of December 31, 2022, 74% of the year-round design capacity of 2,166,575 Dths under firm contract has primary delivery points in California, with the flexibility to access secondary delivery points in Nevada and Utah.
Except for quantities of natural gas owned for operational purposes, Kern River does not own the natural gas that is transported through its system. Kern River's transportation rates are cost-based.
During 2022, Kern River had two customers, including Nevada Power Company, an affiliated company, that each accounted for greater than 10% of its revenue. The loss of these significant customers, if not replaced, could have a material adverse effect on Kern River.
BHE TRANSMISSION
BHE Transmission consists of BHE Canada, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BHE, BHE U.S. Transmission, a wholly owned subsidiary of BHE, ownership interests in generating facilities and 300 MWs of long-term northbound transmission rights on the Montana Alberta Tie Line (commencing April 30, 2026). BHE Canada and BHE U.S. Transmission together own and operate the Montana Alberta Tie Line, which is a 214-mile, 230-kV transmission line that runs from Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada to Great Falls, Montana, U.S. and connects power grids in the two jurisdictions.
BHE Canada
BHE Canada primarily owns AltaLink, a regulated electric transmission utility company headquartered in Alberta, Canada serving approximately 85% of Alberta's population. AltaLink's high voltage transmission lines and related facilities transmit electricity from generating facilities to major load centers, cities and large industrial plants throughout its 87,000 square mile service territory, which covers a diverse geographic area including most major urban centers in central and southern Alberta. AltaLink's transmission facilities, consisting of approximately 8,300 miles of transmission lines and approximately 310 substations as of December 31, 2022, are an integral part of the Alberta Interconnected Electric System ("AIES").
The AIES is a network or grid of transmission facilities operating at high voltages ranging from 69 kV to 500 kV. The grid delivers electricity from generating units across Alberta, Canada through approximately 16,000 miles of transmission lines. The AIES is interconnected to British Columbia's transmission system that links Alberta with the North American western interconnected system, interconnection with Saskatchewan's transmission system and interconnection with Montana's transmission system.
AltaLink is a transmission facility owner within the electricity industry in Alberta and is permitted to charge a tariff rate for the use of its transmission facilities. Such tariff rates are established on a cost-of-service regulatory model, which is designed to allow AltaLink an opportunity to recover its costs of providing services and to earn a reasonable return on its investments. Transmission tariff rates are approved by the AUC and are collected from the AESO. 
The electricity industry in Alberta consists of four principal segments. Generators sell wholesale power into the power pool operated by the AESO and through direct contractual arrangements. Alberta's transmission system or grid is composed of high voltage power lines and related facilities that transmit electricity from generating facilities to distribution networks and directly connected end-users. Distribution facility owners are regulated by the AUC and are responsible for arranging for, or providing, regulated rate and regulated default supply services to convey electricity from transmission systems and distribution-connected generators to end-use customers. Retailers can procure energy through the power pool, through direct contractual arrangements with energy suppliers or ownership of generation facilities and arrange for its distribution to end-use customers.
The AESO mandate is defined in the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta) and its regulations and requires the AESO to assess both current and future needs of Alberta's interconnected electrical system. In January 2022, the AESO released the 2022 Long-term Transmission Plan. Updated every two years, the Long-Term Transmission Plan seeks to optimize the use of the existing transmission system and plan the development of new transmission to ensure a safe and reliable electricity system that enables a fair, efficient and openly competitive electricity market. The 2022 Long-Term Transmission Plan identifies C$1.3 billion in transmission projects over a 10 year period, which results in C$150 million to C$200 million per year on average over that 10 year period. This results in a cumulative transmission rate impact of C$2 per MWh for the first five to eight years, increasing to C$3 per MWh after 15 years. The Long-Term Transmission Plan identifies approximately C$900 million of projects in AltaLink's service territory with in-service dates before 2030.

BHE U.S. Transmission
BHE U.S. Transmission is engaged in various joint ventures to develop, own and operate transmission assets and is pursuing additional investment opportunities in the U.S. Currently, BHE U.S. Transmission has two joint ventures with transmission assets that are operational, ETT, a 50% owned joint venture with subsidiaries of American Electric Power Company, Inc. ("AEP"), and Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC, a 25% owned joint venture with AEP and Evergy, Inc. ETT owns and operates electric transmission assets in the ERCOT and, as of December 31, 2022, had total assets of $3.5 billion. ETT's transmission system includes approximately 1,900 miles of transmission lines and 42 substations as of December 31, 2022. Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC, owns and operates a 108-mile, 345-kV transmission project in Kansas having total assets of $133 million as of December 31, 2022.

HOMESERVICES
HomeServices, a wholly owned subsidiary of BHE, is one of the largest residential real estate brokerage firms in the U.S. In addition to providing traditional residential real estate brokerage services, HomeServices offers other integrated real estate services, including mortgage originations and mortgage banking; title and closing services; property and casualty insurance; home warranties; relocation services; and other home-related services. HomeServices' real estate brokerage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations because more home sale transactions tend to close during the second and third quarters of the year. As a result, HomeServices' operating results and profitability are typically higher in the second and third quarters relative to the remainder of the year. HomeServices' owned brokerages currently operate in nearly 930 offices in 33 states and the District of Columbia with approximately 45,000 real estate agents under 55 brand names. The U.S. residential real estate brokerage business is subject to the general real estate market conditions, is highly competitive and consists of numerous local brokers and agents in each market seeking to represent sellers and buyers in residential real estate transactions.
HomeServices' franchise network currently includes approximately 300 franchisees and over 1,500 brokerage offices with nearly 51,000 real estate agents under two brand names, primarily in the U.S. In exchange for certain fees, HomeServices provides the right to use the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices or Real Living brand names and other related service marks, as well as providing orientation programs, training and consultation services, advertising programs and other services. 
GENERAL REGULATION
BHE's regulated subsidiaries and certain affiliates are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation, which significantly influences their operating environment, prices charged to customers, capital structure, costs and, ultimately, their ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on invested capital. In addition to the discussion contained herein regarding general regulation, refer to "Regulatory Matters" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding certain regulatory matters.
Domestic Regulated Public Utility Subsidiaries
The Utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various state, federal and local agencies. The more significant aspects of this regulatory framework are described below.
State Regulation
Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, which are designed to allow a utility the opportunity to recover what each state regulatory commission deems to be the utility's reasonable costs of providing services, including a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. In addition to return on investment, a utility's cost of service generally reflects a representative level of prudent expenses, including cost of sales, operating expense, depreciation and amortization and income and other tax expense, reduced by wholesale electricity and other revenue. The allowed operating expenses are typically based on actual historical costs adjusted for known and measurable or forecasted changes. State regulatory commissions may adjust cost of service for various reasons, including pursuant to a review of: (a) the utility's revenue and expenses during a defined test period, (b) the utility's level of investment and (c) changes in income tax laws. State regulatory commissions typically have the authority to review and change rates on their own initiative; however, they may also initiate reviews at the request of a utility, utility customers or organizations representing groups of customers. In certain jurisdictions, the utility and such parties, however, may agree with one another not to request a review of or changes to rates for a specified period of time.
The retail electric rates of the Utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and distribution services. The Utilities have established ECAMs and other cost recovery mechanisms in certain states, which help mitigate their exposure to changes in costs from those assumed in establishing base rates. 
With certain limited exceptions, the Utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes of customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Under Oregon law, PacifiCorp has the exclusive right and obligation to provide electricity distribution services to all residential and nonresidential customers within its allocated service territory; however, nonresidential customers have the right to choose an alternative provider of energy supply. The impact of this right on PacifiCorp's consolidated financial results has not been material. In Washington, state law does not provide for exclusive service territory allocation. PacifiCorp's service territory in Washington is surrounded by other public utilities with whom PacifiCorp has from time to time entered into service area agreements under the jurisdiction of the WUTC. Under California law, PacifiCorp has the exclusive right and obligation to provide electricity distribution services to all residential and nonresidential customers within its allocated service territory; however, cities, counties and certain other public agencies have the right to choose to generate energy supply or elect an alternative provider of energy supply through the formation of a Community Choice Aggregator ("CCA"). To date, no CCA activity has occurred in PacifiCorp's California service territory. If a CCA is formed, PacifiCorp would continue to provide CCA customers transmission, distribution, metering and billing services and the CCA would provide generation supply. In addition, PacifiCorp would likely be able to collect costs from CCA customers for the generation-related costs that PacifiCorp incurred while they were customers of PacifiCorp. PacifiCorp would remain the electricity provider of last resort for these customers. In Illinois, state law has established a competitive environment so that all Illinois customers are free to choose their retail service supplier. For customers that choose an alternative retail energy supplier, MidAmerican Energy continues to have an ongoing obligation to deliver the supplier's energy to the retail customer. MidAmerican Energy bills the retail customer for such delivery services. MidAmerican Energy also has an obligation to serve customers at regulated cost-based rates and has a continuing obligation to serve customers who have not selected a competitive electricity provider. The impact of this right on MidAmerican Energy's financial results has not been material. In Nevada, Chapter 704B of the Nevada Revised Statutes allows retail electric customers with an average annual load of one MW or more to file a letter of intent and application with the PUCN to acquire electric energy and ancillary services from another energy supplier. The law requires customers wishing to choose a new supplier to receive the approval of the PUCN to meet public interest standards. In particular, departing customers must secure new energy resources that are not under contract to the Nevada Utilities, the departure must not burden the Nevada Utilities with increased costs or cause any remaining customers to pay increased costs and the departing customers must pay their portion of any deferred energy balances, all as determined by the PUCN. SB 547 revised Chapter 704B to establish limits on the amount of load eligible to take service under Chapter 704B and to set those limits as a part of the IRP filed by the Nevada Utilities. Also, the Utilities and the state regulatory commissions are individually evaluating how best to integrate private generation resources into their service and rate design, including considering such factors as maintaining high levels of customer safety and service reliability, minimizing adverse cost impacts and fairly allocating costs among all customers.
In Nevada, large natural gas customers using 12,000 therms per month with fuel switching capability are allowed to participate in the incentive natural gas rate tariff. Once a service agreement has been executed, a customer can compare natural gas prices under this tariff to alternative energy sources and choose its source of natural gas. In addition, natural gas customers using greater than 1,000 therms per day have the ability to secure their own natural gas supplies under the gas transportation tariff. 
PacifiCorp
            Rate Filings
Under Utah law, the UPSC must issue a written order within 240 days of a public utility's application for a general rate change. Absent an order, the proposed rates go into effect as filed and are not subject to refund, the UPSC may allow interim rates to take effect within 45 days of an application, subject to refund or surcharge, if an adequate prima facie showing is established in hearing that the interim rate change is justified.
In Oregon, the OPUC has the authority to suspend proposed new rates for a period not to exceed more than six months, with an additional three-month extension, beyond the 30-day time period when the new rates would otherwise go into effect. Absent suspension or other action from the OPUC, new rates automatically go into effect 30 days from filing by the utility. Upon suspension by the OPUC, the OPUC is authorized to allow the collection of an interim rate, subject to refund, during the pendency of the OPUC's review of the rate request.
In Wyoming, the WPSC can allow interim rates to go into effect 30 days after the initial application but may require a bond to secure a refund for the amount. The WPSC may suspend the rates for final approval for a period not to exceed 10 months.
In Washington, the WUTC has the authority to suspend proposed new rates, subject to hearing, for a period not to exceed 10 months beyond the 30-day time period when the new rate would otherwise go into effect.
Under Idaho law, the IPUC can suspend a filing for an initial period not to exceed five months and an additional extension of 60 days with a showing of good cause.
In California, the CPUC has the authority to suspend proposed new rates, subject to hearing, for a period not to exceed 18 months. The CPUC may extend the suspension period on a case-by-case basis.
            Adjustment Mechanisms
In addition to recovery through base rates, PacifiCorp also achieves recovery of certain costs through various adjustment mechanisms as summarized below.

State Regulator | Base Rate Test Period | Adjustment Mechanism 
UPSC | Forecasted or historical with known and measurable changes(1) | EBA under which 100% of the difference between base net power costs set during a general rate case and actual net power costs is deferred and reflected in future rates. Wheeling revenue is also included in the mechanism. Beginning in 2021, the mechanism includes a true-up of PTCs at 100%.

MidAmerican Energy
            Rate Filings
Under Iowa law, a utility may implement temporary rates, without IUB review and subject to refund, on or after 10 days of filing a request for higher base rates. If the IUB has not issued a final order within 10 months after the filing date, the temporary rates become final. Under Illinois law, new base rates may become effective 45 days after the filing of a request with the ICC, or earlier with ICC approval. The ICC has authority to suspend the proposed new rates, subject to hearing, for a period not to exceed approximately 11 months after filing. South Dakota law authorizes the SDPUC to suspend new base rates for up to six months during the pendency of rate proceedings; however, a utility may implement all or a portion of the proposed new rates six months after the filing of a request for a rate increase subject to refund pending a final order in the proceeding.
Iowa law also permits rate-regulated utilities to seek ratemaking principles with the IUB prior to the construction of certain types of new generating facilities. Pursuant to this law, MidAmerican Energy has applied for and obtained IUB ratemaking principles orders for a 484-MW (MidAmerican Energy's share) coal-fueled generating facility, a 495-MW combined cycle natural gas-fueled generating facility and 6,639 MWs (nominal ratings) of wind-powered generating facilities as of December 31, 2022. These ratemaking principles established cost caps for the projects, below which such costs are deemed prudent by the IUB and authorized a fixed rate of return on equity for the respective generating facilities over the regulatory life of the facilities in any future Iowa rate proceeding. As of December 31, 2022, the generating facilities in-service totaled $7.6 billion, or 36%, of MidAmerican Energy's regulated property, plant and equipment, net and were subject to these ratemaking principles at a weighted average return on equity of 11.4% with a weighted average remaining life of 32 years. 
Ratemaking principles for several wind-powered generation projects have established mechanisms in Iowa where electric rate base may be reduced. The current revenue sharing mechanism is in accordance with Wind XII ratemaking principles and reduces rate base for Iowa electric returns on equity exceeding an established benchmark. Sharing is triggered by MidAmerican Energy's actual equity return being above a threshold calculated annually. The threshold, not to exceed 11%, is the weighted average equity return of rate base with returns authorized via ratemaking principles proceedings and all other rate base. For all other rate base, the return is based on interest rates on 30-year A-rated utility bond yields plus 400 basis points, with a minimum return of 9.5%. MidAmerican Energy shares with customers 90% of the revenue in excess of the trigger. A second mechanism, the retail customer benefit mechanism, reduces electric rate base for the value of higher cost retail energy displaced by covered wind-powered production and applies to the wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service in 2016 under the Wind X project and facilities constructed under the Wind XII project approved by the IUB in 2018. Rate base reductions under these mechanisms are applied to coal and other generation facilities in specified orders.
            Adjustment Mechanisms
Under its current Iowa, Illinois and South Dakota electric tariffs, MidAmerican Energy is allowed to recover fluctuations in electric energy costs for its retail electric sales through fuel, or energy, cost adjustment mechanisms. Additionally, MidAmerican Energy has transmission adjustment clauses to recover certain transmission charges related to retail customers in all jurisdictions. The transmission adjustment mechanisms recover costs billed by the MISO for regional transmission service. The Illinois adjustment mechanism additionally recovers MidAmerican Energy's entire transmission revenue requirement attributable to Illinois. The adjustment mechanisms reduce the regulatory lag for the recovery of energy and transmission costs related to retail electric customers in these jurisdictions and accomplish, with limited timing differences, a pass-through of the related costs to these customers. Recoveries through these adjustment mechanisms are reflected in operating revenue, and the related costs are reflected in cost of fuel and energy or operations and maintenance expense, as applicable. 
Of the wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service as of December 31, 2022, 5,022 MWs (nominal ratings) have not been included in the determination of MidAmerican Energy's Iowa retail electric base rates. In accordance with related ratemaking principles, until such time as these generation assets are reflected in base rates and ceasing thereafter, MidAmerican Energy will continue to reduce its revenue from Iowa EAC recoveries by $12 million each calendar year. 
MidAmerican Energy's cost of natural gas purchased for resale is collected for each jurisdiction through a uniform PGA, which is updated monthly to reflect changes in actual costs. Subject to prudence reviews, the PGA accomplishes a pass-through of MidAmerican Energy's cost of natural gas purchased for resale to its customers and, accordingly, has no direct effect on net income. 
MidAmerican Energy's electric and natural gas energy efficiency program costs are collected through bill riders that are adjusted annually based on actual and expected costs in accordance with the energy efficiency plans filed with and approved by the respective state regulatory commission. As such, the energy efficiency program costs, which are reflected in operations and maintenance expense, and related recoveries, which are reflected in operating revenue, have no direct impact on net income.
MidAmerican Energy has income tax rider mechanisms in Iowa and Illinois that were established in response to 2017 Tax Reform, which enacted significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code, including, among other things, a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. South Dakota implemented changes to base rates in response to 2017 Tax Reform. As a result of 2017 Tax Reform, MidAmerican Energy re-measured its accumulated deferred income tax balances at the 21% rate and increased regulatory liabilities pursuant to the approved mechanisms. In December 2018, the IUB approved in final form a tax expense revision mechanism that reduces customer electric rates for the impact of the lower income tax rate on current operations, as calculated annually, and defers the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes created by their re-measurement at the 21% income tax rate to a regulatory liability, the disposition of which will be determined in MidAmerican Energy's next rate case. In 2018, Iowa Senate File 2417 was signed into law, which, among other items, reduced the state of Iowa corporate tax rate from 12% to 9.8% effective in 2021, at which time, the impacts of Iowa Senate File 2417 began to be included in the Iowa tax expense revision mechanism.
NV Energy (Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific)
            Rate Filings
Nevada statutes require the Nevada Utilities to file electric general rate cases once every three years with the PUCN. Sierra Pacific may also file natural gas general rate cases with the PUCN. The Nevada Utilities are also subject to a two-part fuel and purchased power adjustment mechanism. The Nevada Utilities make quarterly filings to reset the BTERs, based on the last 12 months of fuel and purchased power costs. The difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs and the revenue collected in the BTERs is deferred into a balancing account. The DEAA rate clears amounts deferred into the balancing account. Nevada regulations allow an electric or natural gas utility that adjusts its BTERs on a quarterly basis to request PUCN approval to make quarterly changes to its DEAA rate if the request is in the public interest. During required annual DEAA proceedings, the prudence of fuel and purchased power costs is reviewed, and if any costs are disallowed on such grounds, the disallowances will be incorporated into the next quarterly BTERs change. Also, on an annual basis, the Nevada Utilities (a) seek a determination that energy efficiency program expenditures were reasonable, (b) request that the PUCN reset base and amortization EEPR, and (c) request that the PUCN reset base and amortization EEIR. 
            EEPR and EEIR
EEPR was established to allow the Nevada Utilities to recover the costs of implementing energy efficiency programs and EEIR was established to offset the negative impacts on revenue associated with the successful implementation of energy efficiency programs. These rates change once a year in the utility's annual DEAA application based on energy efficiency program budgets prepared by the Nevada Utilities and approved by the PUCN in the IRP proceedings. When the Nevada Utilities' regulatory earned rate of return for a calendar year exceeds the regulatory rate of return used to set base tariff general rates, they are obligated to refund energy efficiency implementation revenue previously collected for that year. 
            Net Metering
Nevada enacted Assembly Bill 405 ("AB 405") on June 15, 2017. The legislation, among other things, established net metering crediting rates for private generation customers with installed net metering systems less than 25 kilowatts. Under AB 405, private generation customers will be compensated for excess energy on a monthly basis at 95% of the rate the customer would have paid for a kilowatt-hour of electricity supplied by the Nevada Utilities for the first 80 MWs of cumulative installed capacity of all net metering systems in Nevada, 88% of the rate for the next 80 MWs, 81% of the rate for the next 80 MWs and 75% of the rate for any additional private generation capacity. As of December 31, 2022, the cumulative installed and applied-for capacity of net metering systems under AB 405 in Nevada was 583 MWs. 
            Natural Disaster Protection Plan ("NDPP")
SB 329, Natural Disaster Mitigation Measures, was signed into law on May 22, 2019. The legislation requires the Nevada Utilities to submit a NDPP to the PUCN. The PUCN adopted NDPP regulations on January 29, 2020, that require the Nevada Utilities to file their NDPP for approval on or before March 1 of every third year. The regulations also require annual updates to be filed on or before September 1 of the second and third years of the plan. The plan must include procedures, protocols and other certain information as it relates to the efforts of the Nevada Utilities to prevent or respond to a fire or other natural disaster. The expenditures incurred by the Nevada Utilities in developing and implementing the NDPP are required to be held in a regulatory asset account, with the Nevada Utilities filing an application for recovery on or before March 1 of each year. The PUCN reopened its investigation and rulemaking on SB 329 and the comment period for the reopened investigation ended in early February 2021. Final regulations are pending.
Federal Regulation
The FERC is an independent agency with broad authority to implement provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act ("NGA"), the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ("Energy Policy Act") and other federal statutes. The FERC regulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the expansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention; securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has the enforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1.5 million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the Federal Power Act. The Utilities have implemented programs and procedures that facilitate and monitor compliance with the FERC's regulations described below. MidAmerican Energy is also subject to regulation by the NRC pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended ("Atomic Energy Act"), with respect to its ownership interest in the Quad Cities Station.
Wholesale Electricity and Capacity
The FERC regulates the Utilities' rates charged to wholesale customers for electricity and transmission capacity and related services. Much of the Utilities' wholesale electricity sales and purchases occur under market-based pricing allowed by the FERC and are therefore subject to market volatility. The Utilities are precluded from selling at market-based rates in the PacifiCorp-East, PacifiCorp-West, Nevada Utilities, Idaho Power Company and NorthWestern Energy balancing authority areas. Wholesale electricity sales in those specific balancing authority areas are permitted at cost-based rates. PacifiCorp and the Nevada Utilities have been granted the authority to bid into the California EIM at market-based rates.
The Utilities' authority to sell electricity in wholesale electricity markets at market-based rates is subject to triennial reviews conducted by the FERC. Accordingly, the Utilities are required to submit triennial filings to the FERC that demonstrate a lack of market power over sales of wholesale electricity and electric generation capacity in their respective market areas. PacifiCorp, the Nevada Utilities and certain affiliates, representing the BHE Northwest Companies, file together for market power study purposes. The BHE Northwest Companies' most recent triennial filing was made in June 2022 and is under review by the FERC. MidAmerican Energy and certain affiliates file together for market power study purposes of the FERC-defined Northeast Region. The most recent triennial filing for the Northeast Region was made in June 2020 and an order accepting it was issued in December 2020. MidAmerican Energy and certain affiliates file together for market power study purposes of the FERC-defined Central Region. The most recent triennial filing for the Central Region was made in December 2020 and an order accepting it was issued in March 2022. Under the FERC's market-based rules, the Utilities must also file with the FERC a notice of change in status when there is a change in the conditions that the FERC relied upon in granting market-based rate authority. MidAmerican Energy most recently filed a notice of non-material change in status in July 2022, and the filing is currently under review by the FERC.
Transmission
PacifiCorp's and the Nevada Utilities' wholesale transmission services are regulated by the FERC under cost-based regulation subject to PacifiCorp's and the Nevada Utilities' OATTs. These services are offered on a non-discriminatory basis, which means that all potential customers are provided an equal opportunity to access the transmission system. PacifiCorp's and the Nevada Utilities' transmission business is managed and operated independently from its wholesale marketing business in accordance with the FERC's Standards of Conduct. PacifiCorp and the Nevada Utilities have made several required compliance filings in accordance with these rules.
In December 2011, PacifiCorp adopted a cost-based formula rate under its OATT for its transmission services. Cost-based formula rates are intended to be an effective means of recovering PacifiCorp's investments and associated costs of its transmission system without the need to file rate cases with the FERC, although the formula rate results are subject to discovery and challenges by the FERC and intervenors. A significant portion of these services are provided to PacifiCorp's energy supply management function.
MidAmerican Energy participates in the MISO as a transmission-owning member. Accordingly, the MISO is the transmission provider under its FERC-approved OATT. While the MISO is responsible for directing the operation of MidAmerican Energy's transmission system, MidAmerican Energy retains ownership of its transmission assets and, therefore, is subject to the FERC's reliability standards discussed below. MidAmerican Energy's transmission business is managed and operated independently from its wholesale marketing business in accordance with the FERC's Standards of Conduct.
MidAmerican Energy constructed and owns four Multi-Value Projects ("MVPs") located in Iowa and Illinois that added approximately 250 miles of 345-kV transmission line to MidAmerican Energy's transmission system since 2012. The MISO's OATT allows for broad cost allocation for MidAmerican Energy's MVPs, including similar MVPs of other MISO participants. Accordingly, a significant portion of the revenue requirement associated with MidAmerican Energy's MVP investments is shared with other MISO participants based on the MISO's cost allocation methodology, and a portion of the revenue requirement of the other participants' MVPs is allocated to MidAmerican Energy, which MidAmerican Energy recovers from customers via a rider mechanism. The transmission assets and financial results of MidAmerican Energy's MVPs are excluded from the determination of its base retail electric rates.
The FERC has established an extensive number of mandatory reliability standards developed by the NERC and the WECC, including planning and operations, critical infrastructure protection and regional standards. Compliance, enforcement and monitoring oversight of these standards is carried out by the FERC; the NERC; and the WECC for PacifiCorp, Nevada Power, and Sierra Pacific; and the Midwest Reliability Organization for MidAmerican Energy.
Hydroelectric
The FERC licenses and regulates the operation of hydroelectric systems, including license compliance and dam safety programs. Most of PacifiCorp's hydroelectric generating facilities are licensed by the FERC as major systems under the Federal Power Act, and certain of these systems are licensed under the Oregon Hydroelectric Act. Under the Federal Power Act, 16 of PacifiCorp's hydroelectric developments are classified as "high hazard potential," meaning it is probable in the event of a dam failure that loss of human life in the downstream population could occur. PacifiCorp uses the FERC's guidelines to develop public safety programs consisting of a dam safety program and emergency action plans.
For an update regarding PacifiCorp's Klamath River hydroelectric system, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of PacifiCorp in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission
    General
MidAmerican Energy is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC with respect to its license and 25% ownership interest in Quad Cities Station. Constellation Energy, the operator and 75% owner of Quad Cities Station, is under contract with MidAmerican Energy to secure and keep in effect all necessary NRC licenses and authorizations.
The NRC regulates the granting of permits and licenses for the construction and operation of nuclear generating stations and regularly inspects such stations for compliance with applicable laws, regulations and license terms. Current licenses for Quad Cities Station provide for operation until December 14, 2032. The NRC review and regulatory process covers, among other things, operations, maintenance, environmental and radiological aspects of such stations. The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, the regulations under such Act or the terms of such licenses. 
Federal regulations provide that any nuclear operating facility may be required to cease operation if the NRC determines there are deficiencies in state, local or utility emergency preparedness plans relating to such facility, and the deficiencies are not corrected. Constellation Energy has advised MidAmerican Energy that an emergency preparedness plan for Quad Cities Station has been approved by the NRC. Constellation Energy has also advised MidAmerican Energy that state and local plans relating to Quad Cities Station have been approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The NRC also regulates the decommissioning of nuclear-powered generating facilities, including the planning and funding for the eventual decommissioning of the facilities. In accordance with these regulations, MidAmerican Energy submits a biennial report to the NRC providing reasonable assurance that funds will be available to pay its share of the costs of decommissioning Quad Cities Station. MidAmerican Energy has established a trust for the investment of funds collected for nuclear decommissioning of Quad Cities Station.
Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 ("NWPA"), the DOE is responsible for the selection and development of repositories for, and the permanent disposal of, spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive wastes. Constellation Energy, as required by the NWPA, signed a contract with the DOE under which the DOE was to receive spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste for disposal beginning not later than January 1998. The DOE did not begin receiving spent nuclear fuel on the scheduled date and remains unable to receive such fuel and waste. The costs to be incurred by the DOE for disposal activities were previously being financed by fees charged to owners and generators of the waste. In accordance with a 2013 ruling by the D.C. Circuit, the DOE, in May 2014, provided notice that, effective May 16, 2014, the spent nuclear fuel disposal fee would be zero. In 2004, Constellation Energy, reached a settlement with the DOE concerning the DOE's failure to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel in 1998. As a result, Quad Cities Station has been billing the DOE, and the DOE is obligated to reimburse the station for all station costs incurred due to the DOE's delay. Constellation Energy has constructed an interim spent fuel storage installation ("ISFSI") at Quad Cities Station consisting of two pads to store spent nuclear fuel in dry casks in order to free space in the storage pool. The first dry cask was placed in-service in 2005. As of December 31, 2021, the first pad at the ISFSI is full, and the second pad is in operation. The first and second pads at the ISFSI are expected to facilitate storage of casks to support operations at Quad Cities Station through the end of its operating licenses.
Nuclear Insurance
MidAmerican Energy maintains financial protection against catastrophic loss associated with its interest in Quad Cities Station through a combination of insurance purchased by Constellation Energy, insurance purchased directly by MidAmerican Energy, and the mandatory industry-wide loss funding mechanism afforded under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 ("Price-Anderson"), which was amended and extended by the Energy Policy Act. The general types of coverage maintained are: nuclear liability, property damage or loss and nuclear worker liability, as discussed below.
Constellation Energy purchases private market nuclear liability insurance for Quad Cities Station in the maximum available amount of $450 million, which includes coverage for MidAmerican Energy's ownership. In accordance with Price-Anderson, excess liability protection above that amount is provided by a mandatory industry-wide Secondary Financial Protection program under which the licensees of nuclear generating facilities could be assessed for liability incurred due to a serious nuclear incident at any commercial nuclear reactor in the U.S. Currently, MidAmerican Energy's aggregate maximum potential share of an assessment for Quad Cities Station is approximately $69 million per incident, payable in installments not to exceed $10 million annually.
The insurance for nuclear property damage losses covers property damage, stabilization and decontamination of the facility, disposal of the decontaminated material and premature decommissioning arising out of a covered loss. For Quad Cities Station, Constellation Energy purchases primary property insurance protection for the combined interests in Quad Cities Station, with coverage limits for nuclear damage losses up to $1.5 billion for nuclear perils and $500 million for non-nuclear perils. MidAmerican Energy also directly purchases extra expense coverage for its share of replacement power and other extra expenses in the event of a covered accidental outage at Quad Cities Station. The property and related coverages purchased directly by MidAmerican Energy and by Constellation Energy, which includes the interests of MidAmerican Energy, are underwritten by an industry mutual insurance company and contain provisions for retrospective premium assessments to be called upon based on the industry mutual board of directors' discretion for adverse loss experience. Currently, the maximum retrospective amounts that could be assessed against MidAmerican Energy from industry mutual policies for its obligations associated with Quad Cities Station total $8 million.
The master nuclear worker liability coverage, which is purchased by Constellation Energy for Quad Cities Station, is an industry-wide guaranteed-cost policy with an aggregate limit of $450 million for the nuclear industry as a whole, which is in effect to cover tort claims of workers in nuclear-related industries. 
U.S. Mine Safety
PacifiCorp's surface mining operations are regulated by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, which administers federal mine safety and health laws and regulations, and state regulatory agencies. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration has the statutory authority to institute a civil action for relief, including a temporary or permanent injunction, restraining order or other appropriate order against a mine operator who fails to pay penalties or fines for violations of federal mine safety standards. Information regarding PacifiCorp's mine safety violations and other legal matters disclosed in accordance with Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act is included in Exhibit 95 to this Form 10-K.
Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Subsidiaries
The Pipeline Companies are regulated by the FERC, pursuant to the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a) rates, charges, terms and conditions of service, (b) the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities and (c) the construction and operation of LNG export/import facilities. The Pipeline Companies hold certificates of public convenience and necessity and LNG facility authorizations issued by the FERC, which authorize them to construct, operate and maintain their pipeline and related facilities and services.
In February 2022, the FERC updated its certificate policy that guides the authorization of natural gas projects and issued an interim policy providing guidance on how the FERC will review a natural gas project for its impact on climate change. The policies apply to pending and future natural gas projects. On March 24, 2022, the FERC revoked application of the policies and sought further comments.
FERC regulations and the Pipeline Companies' tariffs allow each of the Pipeline Companies to charge approved rates for the services set forth in their respective tariffs. Generally, these rates are a function of the cost of providing services to customers, including prudently incurred operations and maintenance expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization and a reasonable return on invested capital. Tariff rates for each of the Pipeline Companies have been developed under a rate design methodology whereby substantially all fixed costs, including a return on invested capital and income taxes, are collected through reservation charges, which are paid by firm transportation and storage customers regardless of volumes shipped. Commodity charges, which are paid only with respect to volumes actually shipped, are designed to recover the remaining, primarily variable, costs. Kern River's reservation rates have historically been approved using a "levelized" cost-of-service methodology so that the rate remains constant over the levelization period. This levelized cost of service has been achieved by using a FERC-approved depreciation schedule in which depreciation increases as the cost of capital decreases on declining rate base. Each of the Pipeline Companies also hold authority to negotiate rates for their services, subject to requirements to offer cost-based rate alternatives, and to publish such negotiated rates. In addition, for services that are not subject to FERC rate jurisdiction pursuant to Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act, Cove Point charges rates that are established by contract.
The Pipeline Companies' rates are subject to change in future general rate proceedings. Rates for natural gas pipelines are changed by filings under either Section 5 or Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act. Section 5 proceedings are initiated by the FERC or the pipeline's customers for a potential reduction to rates that the FERC finds are no longer just and reasonable. In a Section 5 proceeding, the initiating party has the burden of demonstrating that the currently effective rates of the pipeline are no longer just and reasonable, and of demonstrating alternative just and reasonable rates. Any rate decrease as a result of a Section 5 proceeding is implemented prospectively upon the issuance of a final FERC order adopting the new just and reasonable rates. Section 4 rate proceedings are initiated by the natural gas pipeline, who must demonstrate that the new proposed rates are just and reasonable. The new rates as a result of a Section 4 proceeding are typically implemented six months after the Section 4 filing if higher than prior rates and are subject to refund upon issuance of a final order by the FERC.
The FERC-regulated natural gas companies may not grant undue preference to any customer. FERC regulations require that certain information be made public for market access, through standardized internet websites. These regulations also restrict each pipeline's marketing affiliates' access to certain non-public information that could affect price or availability of service.
Interstate natural gas pipelines are also subject to regulations administered by the Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency of the DOT. Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended ("NGPSA"), which establishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas facilities, and requires an entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such plans. Major amendments to the NGPSA include the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 ("2002 Act"), the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 ("2006 Act"), the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 ("2011 Act") the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 ("2016 Act") and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020 ("2020 Act").
The 2002 Act established additional safety and pipeline integrity regulations for all natural gas pipelines in high-consequence areas. The 2002 Act imposed major new requirements in the areas of operator qualifications, risk analysis and integrity management. The 2002 Act mandated more frequent periodic inspection or testing of natural gas pipelines in high-consequence areas, which are locations where the potential consequences of a natural gas pipeline accident may be significant or may do considerable harm to persons or property. Pursuant to the 2002 Act, the DOT promulgated regulations that require natural gas pipeline operators to develop comprehensive integrity management programs, to identify applicable threats to natural gas pipeline segments that could impact high-consequence areas, to assess these segments and to provide ongoing mitigation and monitoring. The regulations require recurring inspections of high-consequence area segments every seven years after the initial baseline assessment.
The 2006 Act required pipeline operators to institute human factors management plans for personnel employed in pipeline control centers. DOT regulations published pursuant to the 2006 Act required development and implementation of written control room management procedures.
The 2011 Act was a response to natural gas pipeline incidents, most notably the San Bruno natural gas pipeline explosion that occurred in September 2010 in California. The 2011 Act increased the maximum allowable civil penalties for violations, directs operator assistance for Federal authorities conducting investigations and authorized the DOT to hire additional inspection and enforcement personnel. The 2011 Act also directed the DOT to study several topics, including the definition of high-consequence areas, the use of automatic shutoff valves in high-consequence areas, expansion of integrity management requirements beyond high-consequence areas and cast iron pipe replacement. The studies are complete, and a number of notices of proposed rulemaking have been issued. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") issued the Safety of Gas Transmission Pipelines: MAOP Reconfirmation, Expansion of Assessment Requirements and Other Related Amendments final rule in October 2019. The primary change was the expansion of the pipeline integrity assessment requirements to cover moderate-consequence areas and reconfirming maximum allowable operating pressures. Pipeline operators were required to develop procedures to address assessment requirements by July 2021 and complete 50% of the required MAOP reconfirmation actions by 2028 and the remaining by 2035. The BHE Pipeline Group has updated procedures, identified pipeline segments subject to the rule and has planned projects to complete required assessments. PHMSA sent Part 2 of the rule to the Federal Register for publishing August 4, 2022, and it was published in the Federal Register August 24, 2022. The rule initially had an effective date of May 2023, but has been extended to February 2024. The third part of the rule, the gas gathering rule, has also been issued, but has minimal impact on the BHE Pipeline Group.
The 2016 Act required the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to set federal minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities and authorized emergency order authority. In February 2020, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued a final rule regarding underground natural gas storage facilities that incorporates by reference the American Petroleum Institute's Recommended Practice 1171, "Functional Integrity of Natural Gas Storage in Depleted Hydrocarbon Reservoirs and Aquifer Reservoirs," clarifies certain aspects of the mandatory nature of the standard and defines regulatory completion dates for underground storage facility risk assessments. The BHE Pipeline Group has 20 total underground natural gas storage fields at EGTS and Northern Natural Gas that fall under this regulation and is complying with the final rule. The BHE Pipeline Group underground storage fields have had several audits under the Final Rule with no notices of probable violations issued. Kern River, Carolina Gas and Cove Point do not have underground natural gas storage facilities.
The 2020 Act required operations to review and update their inspection and maintenance plans to address how the plans contribute to eliminate hazardous leaks of natural gas, reduction of fugitive emissions and replacement or remediation of pipelines that are known to leak based on the material, design or past operating maintenance history. BHE Pipeline Group has completed the review and update of its inspection and maintenance plans. To assist in this effort, Kern River participated in a non-punitive pilot inspection with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.
The DOT and related state agencies routinely audit and inspect the pipeline facilities for compliance with their regulations. The Pipeline Companies conduct periodic internal audits of their facilities with more frequent reviews of those deemed higher risk. The Pipeline Companies also conduct preliminary audits in advance of agency audits. Compliance issues that arise during these audits or during the normal course of business are addressed on a timely basis. The Pipeline Companies believe their pipeline systems comply in all material respects with the NGPSA and with DOT regulations issued pursuant to the NGPSA.
Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies
The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies, as holders of electricity distribution licenses, are subject to regulation by GEMA. GEMA regulates distribution network operators ("DNOs") within the terms of the Electricity Act 1989 and the terms of DNO licenses, which are revocable with 25 years notice. Under the Electricity Act 1989, GEMA has a duty to ensure that DNOs can finance their regulated activities and DNOs have a duty to maintain an investment grade credit rating. GEMA discharges certain of its duties through its staff within Ofgem. Each of fourteen licensed DNOs distributes electricity from the national grid transmission system and distribution-connected generators to end users within its respective distribution services area.
DNOs are subject to price controls, enforced by Ofgem, that limit the revenue that may be recovered and retained from their electricity distribution activities. The regulatory regime that has been applied to electricity distributors in Great Britain encourages companies to look for efficiency gains in order to improve profits. The distribution price control formula also adjusts the revenue received by DNOs to reflect a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the rate of inflation (as measured by the United Kingdom's Retail Prices Index) and the quality of service delivered by the licensee's distribution system. The next price control, Electricity Distribution 2 ("ED2"), will be set for a period of five years, starting April 1, 2023, although the formula has been, and may be, reviewed by the regulator following public consultation. The procedure and methodology adopted at a price control review are at the reasonable discretion of Ofgem. Ofgem's judgment of the future allowed revenue of licensees is likely to take into account, among other things: 
•the actual operating and capital costs of each of the licensees;
•the operating and capital costs that each of the licensees would incur if it were as efficient as, in Ofgem's judgment, the more efficient licensees;
•the actual value of certain costs which are judged to be beyond the control of the licensees;
•the taxes that each licensee is expected to pay;
•the regulatory value ascribed to the expenditures that have been incurred in the past and the efficient expenditures that are to be incurred in the forthcoming regulatory period;
•the rate of return to be allowed on expenditures that make up the regulatory asset value;
•the financial ratios of each of the licensees and the license requirement for each licensee to maintain investment grade status; 
•an allowance in respect of the repair of the pension deficits in the defined benefit pension schemes sponsored by each of the licensees; and
•any under- or over-recoveries of revenues, relative to allowed revenues, in the previous price control period.
A number of incentive schemes also operate within the current price control period to encourage DNOs to provide an appropriate quality of service to end users. This includes specified payments to be made for failures to meet prescribed standards of service. The aggregate of these guaranteed standards payments is uncapped but may be excused in certain prescribed circumstances that are generally beyond the control of the DNOs.
The current electricity distribution price control became effective April 1, 2015 and is due to terminate on March 31, 2023, and will be immediately replaced with a new price control. Although it has been the convention in Great Britain for regulators to conduct periodic regulatory reviews before making proposals for any changes to the price controls, a new price control can be implemented by GEMA without the consent of the DNOs. If a licensee disagrees with a change to its license, it can appeal the matter to the United Kingdom's CMA, as can certain other parties. Any appeals must be notified within 20 working days of the license modification by GEMA. If the CMA determines that the appellant has relevant standing, then the statute requires that the CMA complete its process within six months, or in some exceptional circumstances seven months. The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies appealed Ofgem's proposals for the resetting of the formula that commenced April 1, 2015, as did one other party, and the CMA subsequently revised GEMA's decision.
The current price control was the first to be set for electricity distribution in Great Britain since Ofgem completed its review of network regulation (known as the RPI-X @ 20 project). The key changes to the price control calculations, compared to those used in previous price controls are that:
•the period over which new regulatory assets are depreciated is being gradually lengthened, from 20 years to 45 years, with the change being phased over eight years;
•allowed revenues will be adjusted during the price control period, rather than at the next price control review, to partially reflect cost variances relative to cost allowances;
•the allowed cost of debt will be updated within the price control period by reference to a long-run trailing average based on external benchmarks of utility debt costs;
•allowed revenues will be adjusted in relation to some new service standard incentives, principally relating to speed and service standards for new connections to the network; and
•there was scope for a mid-period review and adjustment to revenues in the latter half of the period for any changes in the outputs required of licensees for certain specified reasons, although GEMA made no adjustments under this provision.
Under the current price control, as revised by the CMA, and excluding the effects of incentive schemes and any deferred revenues from the prior price control, the opening base allowed revenue of Northern Powergrid (Northeast) plc and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc remains constant in all subsequent years within the price control period (ED1) through 2022-23, before the addition of inflation. Nominal opening base allowed revenues will increase in line with inflation. Adjustments are made annually to recognize the effect of factors such as changes in the allowed cost of debt, performance on incentive schemes and catch up of prior year under- or over- recoveries.
Ofgem has completed the price control review that will result in a new price control effective April 1, 2023. The license modifications that give effect to the price control were published by Ofgem on February 3, 2023 and may be subject to appeal to the CMA if an appeal is filed by March 3, 2023. Many aspects of the current price control were maintained and the changes made generally follow the template that was set by the price controls implemented in April 2021 for transmission and gas distribution in Great Britain. Specific changes include new service standard incentives and mechanisms to adjust cost allowances in specific circumstances, particularly related to investment required to support decarbonization efforts, and partially updating the allowed return on equity within the period for changes in the interest rate on government bonds. Ofgem's final determinations also included an allowed cost of equity of 5.23% plus inflation (calculated using the United Kingdom's consumer prices index including owner occupiers' housing costs) and cost allowances representing a 20% real-term increase compared to the current regulatory period annual average. The base allowed revenue, excluding the effects of incentive schemes, pass-through costs and any deferred revenues from the prior price control, will decrease approximately 4.0% at Northern Powergrid (Northeast) plc and will increase approximately 2.5% at Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc, respectively, in 2023-24 before the addition of inflation.
Ofgem also monitors DNO compliance with license conditions and enforces the remedies resulting from any breach of condition. License conditions include the prices and terms of service, financial strength of the DNO, the provision of information to Ofgem and the public, as well as maintaining transparency, non-discrimination and avoidance of cross-subsidy in the provision of such services. Ofgem also monitors and enforces certain duties of a DNO set out in the Electricity Act 1989, including the duty to develop and maintain an efficient, coordinated and economical system of electricity distribution. Under changes to the Electricity Act 1989 introduced by the Utilities Act 2000, GEMA is able to impose financial penalties on DNOs that contravene any of their license duties or certain of their duties under the Electricity Act 1989, as amended, or that are failing to achieve a satisfactory performance in relation to the individual standards prescribed by GEMA. Any penalty imposed must be reasonable and may not exceed 10% of the licensee's revenue.
AltaLink
AltaLink is regulated by the AUC, pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act (Alberta). The AUC is an independent, quasi-judicial agency established by the province of Alberta, Canada, which is responsible for, among other things, approving the tariffs of transmission facility owners, including AltaLink, and distribution utilities, acquisitions of such transmission facility owners or utilities, and construction and operation of new transmission projects in Alberta. The AUC also investigates and rules on regulated rate disputes and system access problems. The AUC regulates and oversees Alberta's electricity transmission sector with broad authority that may impact many of AltaLink's activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. 
The AUC has various core functions in regulating the Alberta electricity transmission sector, including the following:
•regulating and adjudicating issues related to the operation of electric utilities within Alberta;
•processing and approving general tariff applications relating to revenue requirements, capital expenditure prudency and rates of return including deemed capital structure for regulated utilities while ensuring that utility rates are just and reasonable, and approval of the transmission tariff rates of regulated transmission providers paid by the AESO, which is the independent transmission system operator in Alberta, Canada that controls the operation of AltaLink's transmission system;
•approving the need for new electricity transmission facilities and permits to build and licenses to operate electricity transmission facilities;
•reviewing operations and accounts from electric utilities and conducting on-site inspections to ensure compliance with industry regulation and standards;
•adjudicating enforcement issues including the imposition of administrative penalties that arise when market participants violate the rules of the AESO; and
•collecting, storing, analyzing, appraising and disseminating information to effectively fulfill its duties as an industry regulator.
In addition, AUC approval is required in connection with new energy and regulated utility initiatives in Alberta, amendments to existing approvals and financing proposals by designated utilities.
AltaLink's tariffs are regulated by the AUC under the provisions of the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta) in respect of rates and terms and conditions of service. The Electric Utilities Act (Alberta) and related regulations require the AUC to consider that it is in the public interest to provide consumers the benefit of unconstrained transmission access to competitive generation and the wholesale electricity market. In regulating transmission tariffs, the AUC must facilitate sufficient investment to ensure the timely upgrade, enhancement or expansion of transmission facilities, and foster a stable investment climate and a continued stream of capital investment for the transmission system.
Under the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffs to be paid by the AESO for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of those facilities. The AUC reviews and approves such tariff applications based on a cost-of-service regulatory model under a forward test year basis. Under this model, the AUC provides AltaLink with a reasonable opportunity to (i) earn a fair return on equity; and (ii) recover its forecast costs, including operating expenses, depreciation, borrowing costs and taxes (including deemed income taxes) associated with its regulated transmission business. The AUC must approve tariffs that are just, reasonable and not unduly preferential, arbitrary or unjustly discriminatory. AltaLink's transmission tariffs are not dependent on the price or volume of electricity transported through its transmission system. 
The AESO is an independent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees the Alberta Interconnected Electric System ("AIES") and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the AIES, including long-term transmission system planning. AltaLink and the other transmission facility owners receive substantially all of their transmission tariff revenues from the AESO. The AESO, in turn, charges wholesale tariffs, approved by the AUC, in a manner that promotes fair and open access to the AIES and facilitates a competitive market for the purchase and sale of electricity. The AESO monitors compliance with approved reliability standards, which are enforced by the Market Surveillance Administrator, which may impose penalties on transmission facility owners for non-compliance with the approved reliability standards.
The AESO determines the need and plans for the expansion and enhancement of the transmission system in Alberta in accordance with applicable law and reliability standards. The AESO's responsibilities include long-term transmission planning and management, including assessing the current and future transmission system capacity needs of market participants. When the AESO determines an expansion or enhancement of the transmission system is needed, with limited exceptions, it submits an application to the AUC for approval of the proposed expansion or enhancement. The AESO then determines which transmission provider should submit an application to the AUC for a permit and license to construct and operate the designated transmission facilities. Generally, the transmission provider operating in the geographic area where the transmission facilities expansion or enhancement is to be located is selected by the AESO to build, own and operate the transmission facilities. In addition, Alberta law provides that certain transmission projects may be subject to a competitive process open to qualified bidders. 
Independent Power Projects
The Yuma, Cordova, Saranac, Power Resources, Topaz, Agua Caliente, Solar Star 1, Solar Star 2, Bishop Hill II, Jumbo Road, Marshall, Grande Prairie, Walnut Ridge, Pinyon Pines I, Pinyon Pines II, Santa Rita, Independence, Fluvanna II, Flat Top, Mariah del Norte, Alamo 6 and Pearl independent power projects are Exempt Wholesale Generators ("EWG") under the Energy Policy Act, while the Community Solar Gardens, Imperial Valley and Wailuku independent power projects are currently certified as Qualifying Facilities ("QF") under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. Both EWGs and QFs generally are exempt from compliance with extensive federal and state regulations that control the financial structure of an electric generating plant and the prices and terms at which electricity may be sold by the facilities. 
The Yuma, Cordova, Saranac, Imperial Valley, Topaz, Agua Caliente, Solar Star 1, Solar Star 2, Bishop Hill II, Marshall, Grande Prairie, Walnut Ridge, Independence, Pinyon Pines I and Pinyon Pines II independent power projects have obtained authority from the FERC to sell their power at market-based rates. This authority to sell electricity in wholesale electricity markets at market-based rates is subject to triennial reviews conducted by the FERC. Accordingly, the respective independent power projects are required to submit triennial filings to the FERC that demonstrate a lack of market power over sales of wholesale electricity and electric generation capacity in their respective market areas. The Pinyon Pines I, Pinyon Pines II, Solar Star 1, Solar Star 2, Topaz and Yuma independent power projects and power marketers CalEnergy, LLC and BHER Market Operations, LLC file together for market power study purposes of the FERC-defined Southwest Region. The most recent triennial filing for the Southwest Region was made in June 2022 and is awaiting FERC action. The Cordova and Saranac independent power projects and power marketer CalEnergy, LLC file together with MidAmerican Energy and certain affiliates for market power study purposes of the FERC-defined Northeast Region. The most recent triennial filing for the Northeast Region was made in June 2020 and an order accepting it was issued in December 2020. The Bishop Hill II and Walnut Ridge independent power projects and power marketer CalEnergy, LLC file together with MidAmerican Energy and certain affiliates for market power study purposes of the FERC-defined Central Region. The most recent triennial filing for the Central Region was made in December 2020 and an order accepting it was issued in March 2021. The Marshall and Grande Prairie independent power projects and power marketer CalEnergy, LLC file together for market power study purposes in the FERC-defined Southwest Power Pool Region. The most recent triennial filing for the Southwest Power Pool Region was made in December 2021, was supplemented in July 2022 and an order accepting it was issued in January 2023. Power marketers CalEnergy LLC and BHER Market Operations, LLC also file for market power study purposes in the FERC-defined Northwest Region together with PacifiCorp, Nevada Power Company, Sierra Power Company and certain affiliates. The most recent triennial filing for the Northwest Region was made in June 2022, and is awaiting FERC action.
The entire output of Jumbo Road, Santa Rita, Fluvanna II, Flat Top, Mariah del Norte, Alamo 6, Pearl and Power Resources is within the ERCOT and market-based authority is not required for such sales solely within ERCOT as the ERCOT market is not a FERC-jurisdictional market. Similarly, Wailuku sells its output solely to the Hawaii Electric Light Company within the Hawaii electric grid, which is not a FERC-jurisdictional market and therefore, Wailuku does not require market-based rate authority.
EWGs are permitted to sell capacity and electricity only in the wholesale markets, not to end users. Additionally, utilities are required to purchase electricity produced by QFs at a price that does not exceed the purchasing utility's "avoided cost" and to sell back-up power to the QFs on a non-discriminatory basis, unless they have successfully petitioned the FERC for an exemption from this purchase requirement. Avoided cost is defined generally as the price at which the utility could purchase or produce the same amount of power from sources other than the QF on a long-term basis. The Energy Policy Act eliminated the purchase requirement for utilities with respect to new contracts under certain conditions. New QF contracts are also subject to FERC rate filing requirements, unlike QF contracts entered into prior to the Energy Policy Act. FERC regulations also permit QFs and utilities to negotiate agreements for utility purchases of power at rates other than the utility's avoided cost.

REGULATORY MATTERS
In addition to the discussion contained herein regarding regulatory matters, refer to "General Regulation" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the general regulatory framework. 
PacifiCorp
Oregon
In July 2021, in accordance with the OPUC's December 2020 general rate case order, PacifiCorp filed an application with the OPUC to initiate the review of PacifiCorp's estimated decommissioning and other closure costs per third-party studies associated with its coal-fueled generating facilities. The application requested an initial rate increase of $35 million, or 2.8%, to become effective January 1, 2022, to recover the incremental costs from those approved in the last general rate case. In November 2023, an independent evaluator was selected. Until the independent evaluator completes its work reviewing the third party studies that contain the estimated decommissioning and other closure costs and the OPUC issues an order, there will be no change to rates related to this filing.
In March 2022, PacifiCorp filed a general rate case requesting an overall rate change of $82 million, or 6.6%, to become effective January 1, 2023, that includes cost increases associated with the implementation of PacifiCorp's wildfire mitigation and vegetation management plans. Parties to the case filed testimony in June 2022. PacifiCorp filed reply testimony in July 2022 supporting an overall rate increase of $94 million but proposing that the request be capped at PacifiCorp's original request. PacifiCorp and parties to the case settled various aspects of the general rate case in multiple settlement stipulations. In August 2022, the first partial stipulation was filed resolving issues related to wildfire mitigation and vegetation management, including addressing the associated costs increases. Also in August 2022, a second partial stipulation was filed representing the settlement of certain revenue requirement issues among the stipulating parties, including the extension of Oregon's recovery period for Jim Bridger Units 1 and 2 that will be converted to natural gas-fueled units and certain other issues. In September 2022, a third stipulation was filed resolving most of the remaining issues in the general rate case following the first and second partial stipulations. The stipulations together result in a total rate increase of $49 million, or 3.9%, effective January 1, 2023. The stipulating parties also agreed to amortize certain deferrals totaling approximately $10 million, or 0.8 %, in the first year of amortization, effective April 1, 2023. Further, in the third stipulation, PacifiCorp agreed to a general rate case stay-out provision under which it agreed not to file a general rate case with rates effective any earlier than January 1, 2025. In September 2022, the fourth and final partial stipulation was filed resolving technical issues related to a voluntary renewable energy tariff that will allow non-residential customers to purchase energy from renewable resources not currently in PacifiCorp's rates. In December 2022, the OPUC approved the first, second and third stipulations. The fourth stipulation was approved by the OPUC in February 2023.
In May 2022, PacifiCorp filed its 2021 PCAM, which is the first time since the mechanism has been in place that a rate change has been warranted. After consideration of the mechanism's deadband, sharing band and earnings test, PacifiCorp requested recovery of $52 million, or a 4.2% increase, to become effective January 1, 2023. This request is incremental to the rate change sought in the general rate case. In September 2022, a settlement stipulation was filed agreeing to the recovery of the requested $52 million over a four-year period beginning April 1, 2023. In December 2022, the OPUC approved the settlement stipulation.
In July 2022, PacifiCorp filed an application requesting approval of an automatic adjustment clause with a balancing account to recover costs associated with implementing PacifiCorp's wildfire protection plan in Oregon. Oregon Senate Bill 762 provides for utilities to timely recover these costs through an automatic adjustment clause. The filing requests a rate increase of $20 million, or 1.6%, to recover incremental costs in 2022 and is incremental to costs addressed in PacifiCorp's wildfire mitigation and vegetation management mechanism through the general rate case stipulation described above. While PacifiCorp requested an effective date of August 24, 2022, the OPUC has suspended the filing for further review. In December 2022, a stipulation with certain parties was filed agreeing to the establishment of an automatic adjustment clause. A decision on the stipulation is expected in 2023.
Washington
In June 2021, PacifiCorp filed a power cost only rate case to update baseline net power costs for 2022. PacifiCorp requested a $13 million, or 3.7%, rate increase with an effective date of January 1, 2022. In November 2021, PacifiCorp reached a proposed settlement with most of the parties, which includes an agreement to adjust the PTC rate in base rates and apply a production factor and include a net power cost update as part of the compliance filing. A hearing was held in January 2022 and the WUTC issued an order approving the settlement in March 2022. A compliance filing reflecting a $43 million, or 12.2%, increase was filed in April 2022 and was approved by the WUTC the same month with rates effective May 1, 2022.
In June 2022, PacifiCorp filed its 2021 PCAM and the new tracking mechanism for PTCs approved in the 2021 general rate case. For the 2021 PCAM, PacifiCorp is requesting a recovery of $26 million, or a 6.5% increase. PacifiCorp proposed that the 2021 PCAM be amortized over two years, rather than the one-year period required under the current terms of the PCAM. For the new 2021 PTC tracker, PacifiCorp is seeking recovery of $3 million, or an 0.8% increase. In November 2022, the WUTC approved PacifiCorp's proposal resulting in a combined annual increase of $16 million, or 4.0%, effective January 1, 2023.
Idaho
In October 2022, PacifiCorp filed an application for authority to implement the residential rate modernization plan. The plan proposes a five-year transition to increase the monthly customer service charge from $8.00 to $29.25 per month with a corresponding reduction to the energy rate, eliminates the tiered rates, and adjusts the on-peak off-peak period for time-of-day customers.
California
In August 2021, PacifiCorp filed an application with the CPUC to address California energy costs and GHG allowance costs, and in January 2022, an amended application was filed, per CPUC direction, to reflect ECAC rates which had been approved since the original filing was made. The amended application included an over $3 million rate increase associated with higher energy costs, and the previously sought increase of $3 million to recover GHG allowances. In March 2022, the CPUC approved the increase of $3 million to recover costs for purchasing GHG allowances as required by the state's Cap-and-Trade program. In November 2022, the CPUC approved and made effective the over $3 million rate increase associated with higher energy costs, for a combined rate increase of $7 million, or 6.6%.
In May 2022, PacifiCorp filed a general rate case requesting an overall rate change of $28 million, or 25.7%, to become effective January 1, 2023. In November 2022, the CPUC granted the requested rate effective date and directed PacifiCorp to establish a memorandum account to track the change in rates beginning January 1, 2023 until the new rates become effective, upon the issuance of a decision in late 2023. PacifiCorp filed rebuttal testimony in February 2023 with a slight adjustment of an overall rate increase of $27 million, or 25.0%. Also in February 2023, the CPUC issued a ruling requesting additional information on PacifiCorp's wildfire and risk analyses, and requested additional information regarding wildfire memorandum accounts.
In August 2022, PacifiCorp filed its 2023 combined ECAC and GHG application requesting an overall rate increase of $15 million, or 13.6%, effective January 1, 2023. Approximately $4 million of the increase, or 3.6%, is attributed to the ECAC rate and $11 million of the increase, or 10.0%, to the GHG rate. In February 2023, PacifiCorp filed an amended application, per CPUC direction, to reflect ECAC rates which had been approved since the original filing was made in August 2022. The amended application would result in an overall rate increase of $11 million, or 10.1%. PacifiCorp anticipates interim approval of its GHG rates in March 2023 based on settlement discussions with parties.
FERC Show Cause Order
On April 15, 2021, the FERC issued an order to show cause and notice of proposed penalty related to allegations made by FERC Office of Enforcement staff that PacifiCorp failed to comply with certain NERC reliability standards associated with facility ratings on PacifiCorp's bulk electric system. The order directs PacifiCorp to show cause as to why it should not be assessed a civil penalty of $42 million as a result of the alleged violations. The allegations are related to PacifiCorp's response to a 2010 industry-wide effort directed by the NERC to identify and remediate certain discrepancies resulting from transmission facility design and actual field conditions, including transmission line clearances. In July 2021, PacifiCorp filed its answer to the FERC's show cause order denying the alleged violation of certain NERC reliability standards. The FERC Office of Enforcement staff replied in September 2021. In December 2022, the FERC issued a final order approving a stipulation and consent agreement between the FERC Office of Enforcement and PacifiCorp whereby PacifiCorp agreed to pay a $1.9 million cash penalty and committed to invest $2.5 million in reliability enhancements. The final order concludes the matter.
MidAmerican Energy
South Dakota
In May 2022, MidAmerican Energy filed a request with the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission ("SDPUC") for an increase in its South Dakota retail natural gas rates, which would increase revenue by $7 million annually. If approved, the requested rates would increase retail customers' bills by an average of 6.4%.
Wind PRIME
In January 2022, MidAmerican Energy filed an application with the IUB for advance ratemaking principles for Wind PRIME. If approved, MidAmerican Energy expects to proceed with Wind PRIME, which consists of up to 2,042 MWs of new wind generation and up to 50 MWs of solar generation. If all of Wind PRIME generation is constructed, MidAmerican Energy will own over 9,300 MWs of wind generation and nearly 200 MWs of solar generation. Wind PRIME is projected to allow MidAmerican Energy to generate renewable energy greater than or equal to all of its Iowa retail customers' annual energy needs. MidAmerican Energy secured sufficient safe harbor equipment necessary to remain eligible for 100% PTCs under current tax law. Procedural hearings with the IUB began in February 2023.
Iowa Transmission Legislation
In June 2020, Iowa enacted legislation that grants incumbent electric transmission owners the right to construct, own and maintain electric transmission lines that have been approved for construction in a federally registered planning authority's transmission plan and that connect to the incumbent electric transmission owner's facility. Also known as the Right of First Refusal, the law ensures MidAmerican Energy, as an incumbent electric transmission owner, has the legal right to construct, own and maintain transmission lines that have been approved by the MISO (or another federally registered planning authority) in MidAmerican Energy's service territory. To exercise the legal right, MidAmerican Energy must notify the IUB within 90 days of any such approval for construction that it intends to construct, own and maintain the electric transmission line. The law still requires an incumbent electric transmission owner to obtain a state franchise from the IUB to construct, erect, maintain or operate an electric transmission line and, upon issuance of a franchise, the incumbent electric transmission owner must provide the IUB an estimate of the cost to construct the electric transmission line and, until the construction is complete, a quarterly report updating the estimated cost to construct the electric transmission line. Legal challenges have been brought against similar laws in other states, but courts that have ruled on such cases have upheld the states' laws. In October 2020, a lawsuit challenging the law was filed in Iowa by national transmission interests. The suit raised issues specific to Iowa law, and the State of Iowa defended the law in the suit. MidAmerican Energy intervened and defended the law as well. The Iowa district court dismissed the lawsuit in March 2021 for lack of standing, and the national transmission interests appealed. In June 2022, the Iowa Court of Appeals upheld the district court's decision, after which the national transmission interests asked the Iowa Supreme Court to reconsider. In November 2022, the Iowa Supreme Court granted the motion to reconsider and accepted the case on the briefs already submitted; it is expected that oral arguments will be held in spring 2023. No stay of the law has been granted, and the law remains in effect pending appeal.
NV Energy (Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific)
Senate Bill 448 ("SB 448")
SB 448 was signed into law on June 10, 2021. The legislation is intended to accelerate transmission development, renewable energy and storage, and accelerate transportation electrification within the state of Nevada. In September 2021, the Nevada Utilities filed an amendment to the 2021 Joint IRP for the approval of their Transmission Infrastructure for a Clean Energy Economy Plan that sets forth a plan for the construction of high-voltage transmission infrastructure, Greenlink North among others, that will be placed into service no later than December 31, 2028, and requires the IRP to include at least one scenario that uses sources of supply that will achieve certain reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. In September 2021, the Nevada Utilities filed an application for the approval of their Economic Recovery Transportation Electrification Plan to accelerate transportation electrification in the state of Nevada. The plan establishes requirements for the contents of the transportation electrification investment as well as requirements for review, cost recovery and monitoring. The plan covers an initial period beginning January 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2024. In November 2021, the PUCN issued an order granting the application and accepting the Economic Recovery Transportation Electrification Plan with some modifications. The PUCN opened rulemakings to address other regulations that resulted from SB 448. In February 2022, the PUCN adopted regulations regarding the Economic Development Electric Rate Rider Program to revise the discounted electric rates to ease the economic burden on small businesses who take advantage of the discounted rates under the tariff. In September 2022, the PUCN adopted regulations regarding resource planning, which incorporates a plan to accelerate transportation electrification into the distributed resources plan pursuant to SB 448.
Transportation Electrification Plan ("TEP")
In September 2022, the Nevada Utilities filed an amendment to the 2021 joint IRP for the approval of a Distributed Resource Plan amendment to implement the state's first TEP pursuant to Section 51 of SB 448 and approve proposed tariffs and schedules to implement the TEP. The 2022 TEP outlines programs, investments and incentives to accelerate transportation electrification across Nevada. The Nevada Utilities proposed a budget of $348 million, which represents the maximum cost over the depreciable life of the TEP's programs and assets, to deploy the TEP in 2023 through 2024. A hearing related to the application for approval of the TEP was held in February 2023.
ON Line Temporary Rider ("ONTR")
In October 2021, Sierra Pacific filed an application with the PUCN for approval of the ONTR with corresponding updates to its electric rate tariffs to authorize recovery of the One Nevada Transmission Line ("ON Line") regulatory asset being accumulated as a result of the ON Line cost reallocation as well as the related on-going reallocated revenue requirement. Sierra Pacific's application would have, if approved by the PUCN as filed, resulted in a one-time rate increase of $28 million to be collected over a nine-month period starting on April 1, 2022. In March 2022, the PUCN issued an order directing Sierra Pacific to recover $14 million of the ON Line regulatory asset as a one-time rate increase collectable over a nine-month period effective April 1, 2022, with the expected remaining balance at December 31, 2022 to be included in rate base in the 2022 regulatory rate review for inclusion in the rates set in that case. In December 2022, the PUCN issued an order in the general rate review proceeding allowing for recovery of the remaining regulatory asset balance and directed Sierra Pacific to establish a regulatory liability for any over-collection of revenues from the ONTR rate rider which shall accrue carry charges.
Merger Application
In March 2022, the Nevada Utilities filed a joint application with the PUCN for authorization to merge Sierra Pacific with and into Nevada Power, with Nevada Power being the surviving entity. If approved by the PUCN as filed, Nevada Power will have two distinct electric service territories in northern and southern Nevada each with their own rates and one natural gas service territory in the Reno and Sparks area. In October 2022, all parties to the proceedings relating to the joint application entered into a Stipulation to delay the procedural schedule. The Nevada Utilities made a supplemental filing on December 30, 2022. An order is expected in the first half of 2023.
Regulatory Rate Review
In June 2022, Sierra Pacific filed a regulatory rate review with the PUCN that requested an annual revenue increase of $88 million, or 9.7%. In addition, a filing was made to revise depreciation rates based on a study, the results of which are reflected in the proposed revenue requirement. In August 2022, Sierra Pacific filed an updated certification filing that updated the requested annual revenue increase to $77 million, or 8.5%. Parties to the docket filed testimony and supporting documentation in August and September 2022 while rebuttal testimony was filed in September and October 2022. Hearings in the cost of capital, revenue requirement, and rate design phases were held in September, October, and November 2022, respectively. In December 2022, the PUCN issued an order approving an increase in base rates of $58 million, effective January 1, 2023, reflecting a reduction in Sierra Pacific's requested rate of return, updated depreciation and amortization rates for its electric operations and updated time of use periods to reflect the changes in system costs due to the increased solar generation on the system.
BHE Pipeline Group 
BHE GT&S
In September 2021, EGTS filed a general rate case for its FERC-jurisdictional services, with proposed rates to be effective November 1, 2021. EGTS' previous general rate case was settled in 1998. EGTS proposed an annual cost-of-service of approximately $1.1 billion, and requested increases in various rates, including general system storage rates by 85% and general system transmission rates by 60%. In October 2021, the FERC issued an order that accepted the November 1, 2021 effective date for certain changes in rates, while suspending the other changes for five months following the proposed effective date, until April 1, 2022, subject to refund. In September 2022, a settlement agreement was filed with the FERC, resolving EGTS' general rate case for its FERC-jurisdictional services and providing for increased service rates and decreased depreciation rates. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, EGTS' rates result in an increase to annual firm transmission and storage revenues of approximately $160 million and a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately $30 million, compared to the rates in effect prior to April 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, EGTS' provision for rate refund for April 2022 through December 2022 totaled $90 million and was included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In November 2022, the FERC approved the settlement agreement.
In January 2020, pursuant to the terms of a previous settlement, Cove Point filed a general rate case for its FERC-jurisdictional services, with proposed rates to be effective March 1, 2020. Cove Point proposed an annual cost-of-service of approximately $182 million. In February 2020, the FERC approved suspending the changes in rates for five months following the proposed effective date, until August 1, 2020, subject to refund. In November 2020, Cove Point reached an agreement in principle with the active participants in the general rate case proceeding. Under the terms of the agreement in principle, Cove Point's rates effective August 1, 2020 resulted in an increase to annual revenues of approximately $4 million and a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately $1 million, compared to the rates in effect prior to August 1, 2020. The interim settlement rates were implemented November 1, 2020, and Cove Point's provision for rate refunds for August 2020 through October 2020 totaled $7 million. The agreement in principle was reflected in a stipulation and agreement filed with the FERC in January 2021. In March 2021, the FERC approved the stipulation and agreement and the rate refunds to customers were processed in late April 2021.
Northern Natural Gas
In July 2022, Northern Natural Gas filed a general rate case that proposed an overall annual cost-of-service of $1.3 billion. This is an increase of $323 million above the cost of service filed in its 2019 rate case of $1.0 billion. Depreciation on increased rate base and an increase in depreciation and negative salvage rates account for $115 million of the $323 million increase in the filed cost of service. Northern Natural Gas has requested increases in various rates, including transportation and storage reservation rates. In January 2023, the FERC approved Northern Natural Gas filing to implement its interim rates effective January 1, 2023, subject to refund and the outcome of hearing procedures.
BHE Transmission
AltaLink
2022-2023 General Tariff Application
In April 2021, AltaLink filed its 2022-2023 GTA delivering on the last two years of its commitment to keep rates flat for customers at or below the 2018 level of C$904 million for the five-year period from 2019 to 2023. The two-year application achieves flat tariffs by continuing to transition to the AUC-approved salvage recovery method and continuing the use of the flow-through income tax method, with an overall year-over-year increase of approximately 2% in 2022 and 2023 revenue requirements. AltaLink's 2022-2023 GTA reflected its continued commitment to provide rate stability to customers by maintaining flat tariffs and providing additional tariff relief measures, including a proposed tariff refund of C$60 million of accumulated depreciation in each of 2022 and 2023. The application requested the approval of transmission tariffs of C$824 million and C$847 million for 2022 and 2023, respectively after proposed refunds. In September 2021, AltaLink provided responses to information requests from the AUC and filed an amended application to reflect certain adjustments and forecast updates.
In January 2022, the AUC issued its decision with respect to AltaLink's 2022-2023 GTA. The AUC did not approve AltaLink's proposed refund due to an anticipated improvement in general economic conditions in Alberta. In March 2022, AltaLink filed a review and variance application requesting the AUC to review and vary its decision to deny AltaLink's proposed C$120 million refund of accumulated depreciation surplus, given material changes in circumstances since the decision was issued in January 2022. In May 2022, the AUC issued a decision with respect to AltaLink's application to review and vary its proposed $120 million refund of accumulated depreciation surplus. The AUC did not agree that the Alberta economy had materially deteriorated and determined that the long-term costs outweigh the short-term benefits of the refund.
In July 2022, AltaLink submitted its second compliance filing application with total 2022 and 2023 revenue requirements at C$879 million and C$883 million, respectively. In August 2022, the AUC approved the revised revenue requirements as filed, allowing AltaLink to fully deliver on its flat-for-five commitment to customers.
Generic Cost of Capital Proceeding
In January 2022, the AUC initiated the 2023 generic cost of capital proceeding. The proceeding will be conducted in two stages. The first stage will determine the cost of capital parameters for 2023 and the second stage will consider returning to a formula-based approach to establish cost of capital adjustments, commencing in 2024. In March 2022, the AUC issued its decision with respect to the first stage of the 2023 GCOC proceeding by approving the extension of the 2022 return on equity of 8.5% and deemed equity ratio of 37% for 2023, recognizing lingering uncertainty and continued volatility of financial markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2022, the AUC initiated the second stage to explore a formula-based approach to determine the return on equity for 2024 and future test periods.
    BHE U.S. Transmission 
A significant portion of ETT's revenues are based on interim rate changes that can be filed twice annually and are subject to review and possible true-up in the next filed base regulatory rate review scheduled for no later than February 1, 2025. In February 2023, the Public Utilities Commission of Texas ("PUCT") approved ETT's request to suspend a base regulatory rate review filing scheduled for February 2023. Results of a base regulatory rate review would be prospective except for any deemed disallowance by the PUCT of the transmission investment since the initial base regulatory rate review in 2007. In June 2018, the PUCT approved ETT's application to reduce its transmission revenue by $28 million to reflect the lower federal income tax rate due to 2017 Tax Reform with the amortization of excess accumulated deferred federal income taxes expected to be addressed in the next base rate case. 
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS
Each Registrant is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact each Registrant's current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state, local and international agencies. Each Registrant believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many laws and regulations are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts.
The Company has cumulative investments in (i) owned wind, solar and geothermal generating facilities of $31.6 billion and (ii) wind tax equity investments of $5.8 billion and has retired 16 coal-fueled generation facilities. As a result, as of December 31 2022, the Company reduced its annual GHG emissions by more than 27% as compared to 2005 levels. The Company plans to continue investing in wind, solar and other low-carbon generation and storage in the future, including (i) $6.4 billion on the construction of renewable generating facilities and repowering certain existing wind-powered generating facilities through 2025 and (ii) $1.3 billion on the construction of electric battery and pumped hydro storage facilities through 2025, and to retire an additional 16 coal-fueled generation facilities between 2023 and 2030 in a reliable and cost-effective manner, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels in 2030. Refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" of each respective Registrant in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for discussion of each Registrant's renewable generation-related capital expenditures.
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the "2022 Act") was signed into law. The 2022 Act contains numerous provisions, including expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax on "adjusted financial statement income". The provisions of the 2022 Act become effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The Company currently does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. However, the Company expects future guidance from the Treasury Department and will continue to evaluate the impact of the 2022 Act as more guidance becomes available.
Air Quality Regulations
The Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for protecting and improving the nation's air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulations continue to be promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHE's generating facilities and require them to reduce emissions at those facilities to comply with the requirements. In addition, the potential adoption of state or federal clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources, may also impact electricity generators and natural gas providers. 
National Ambient Air Quality Standards
Under the authority of the Clean Air Act, the EPA sets minimum NAAQS for six principal pollutants, consisting of carbon monoxide, lead, NOx, particulate matter, ozone and SO2, considered harmful to public health and the environment. Areas that achieve the standards, as determined by ambient air quality monitoring, are characterized as being in attainment, while those that fail to meet the standards are designated as being nonattainment areas. Generally, sources of emissions in a nonattainment area that are determined to contribute to the nonattainment are required to reduce emissions. Currently, with the exceptions described in the following paragraphs, air quality monitoring data indicates that all counties where the relevant Registrant's major emission sources are located are in attainment of the current NAAQS.

On June 4, 2018, the EPA published final ozone designations for much of the U.S. Relevant to the Registrants, these designations include classifying Yuma County, Arizona; Clark County, Nevada; and the Northern Wasatch Front, Southern Wasatch Front and Duchesne and Uintah counties in Utah as nonattainment-marginal with the 2015 ozone standard. These areas were required to meet the 2015 standard three years from the August 3, 2018, effective date. All other areas relevant to the Registrants were designated attainment/unclassifiable with this same action. However, on January 29, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated several provisions of the 2018 implementing rules for the 2015 ozone standards for contravening the Clean Air Act. The EPA and environmental groups finalized a consent decree in January 2022 that sets deadlines for the agency to approve or disapprove the "good neighbor" provisions of interstate ozone plans of dozens of states. Relevant to the Registrants, the EPA must, by April 30, 2022, propose to approve or disapprove the interstate ozone SIPs of Alabama, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin. On February 22, 2022, the EPA published a series of proposed decisions to disapprove the SIPs for interstate ozone transport of 19 states. Relevant to the Registrants, these states include Alabama, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, West Virginia and Wisconsin. The EPA also proposed to approve Iowa's SIP after re-analyzing the state's data. In addition, the EPA must approve or disapprove the interstate plans of Arizona, California, Nevada and Wyoming. On April 15, 2022 the EPA issued its final rule approving Iowa's SIP as meeting the good neighbor provisions for the 2015 ozone standard. On May 24, 2022 the EPA disapproved the Utah and Wyoming interstate ozone SIPs. On January 30, 2023, the EPA entered into a stipulated extension to the deadline for action on the Wyoming SIP, setting a new deadline of December 15, 2023. The EPA explained that the extra time is needed to fully consider updated air quality information and public comments. The EPA is also reevaluating SIPs for Tennessee and Arizona. On January 31, 2023, the EPA issued final disapproval of the 19 SIPs proposed in April 2022, setting the stage to include those states in the federal implementation plan described under the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. Separately, on March 28, 2022, the EPA proposed determinations as to whether certain areas have achieved levels of ground-level ozone pollution that meet the 2008 and 2015 ozone NAAQS. Relevant to Registrants, the Southern Wasatch Front in Utah and Yuma, Arizona are proposed to have met the 2015 ozone standard; and the Cincinnati area of Ohio and Kentucky and the Northern Wasatch Front in Utah are proposed to have not met the 2015 ozone, will be reclassified as Moderate Non-Attainment, and will have until August 3, 2024 to meet the standard. Until the EPA takes final action on the proposal and the affected states submit any required SIPs, the relevant Registrants cannot determine the impacts of the proposed rule.
Cross-State Air Pollution Rule
The EPA promulgated an initial rule in March 2005 to reduce emissions of NOx and SO2, precursors of ozone and particulate matter, from down-wind sources in the eastern U.S. to reduce emissions by implementing a plan based on a market-based cap-and-trade system, emissions reductions, or both. After numerous appeals, the CSAPR was promulgated to address interstate transport of SO2 and NOx emissions in 27 Eastern and Midwestern states. In March 2022, the EPA released its Good Neighbor Rule, which contains proposed revisions to the CSAPR framework and is intended to address ozone transport for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. The rule focuses on reductions of NOx and covers 26 states. Relevant to the Registrants, four states are included in the cross-state program for the first time - California, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming. The EPA proposes to retain emissions allowance trading for generating facilities. Beginning in 2023, emissions budgets would be set at the level of reductions achievable through immediately available measures such as consistently operating existing emissions controls. Starting in 2026, emissions budgets would be set at levels achievable by the installation of SCR controls at certain generating facilities. The proposal also includes additional industries beyond the power sector for the first time, with a focus on the top NOx emitting stationary source categories. These include natural gas pipeline compressor stations, among others. These sources will not have access to trading and will instead be subject to rate-based limits that are assigned for each source category. The EPA accepted comments on the proposal through June 21, 2022. On February 1, 2023, the EPA released updated air transport modeling that indicates two states, Delaware and Wyoming, do not significantly contribute to downwind maintenance receptors; and that four states, Arizona, Iowa, Kansas and New Mexico, in fact do significantly contribute to downwind maintenance receptors. It is anticipated that the EPA will rely on this updated modeling in the final good neighbor rule, which it intends to finalize in March 2023. Additional notice and comment rulemaking, such as a supplemental rule, would be required to rescind Iowa's approved SIP and incorporate additional states into the program. Until the EPA takes final action consistent with this decree, impacts to the relevant Registrants cannot be determined.
Regional Haze
The EPA's Regional Haze Rule, finalized in 1999, requires states to develop and implement plans to improve visibility in designated federally protected areas ("Class I areas"). Some of PacifiCorp's coal-fueled generating facilities in Utah, Wyoming, Arizona and Colorado and certain of Nevada Power's and Sierra Pacific's fossil-fueled generating facilities are subject to the Clean Air Visibility Rules. In accordance with the federal requirements, states are required to submit SIPs that address emissions from sources subject to BART requirements and demonstrate progress towards achieving natural visibility requirements in Class I areas by 2064.

In June 2019, the state of Utah incorporated a BART alternative into its SIP for regional haze planning period one. The BART alternative makes the shutdown of PacifiCorp's Carbon generating facility enforceable under the SIP and removes the requirement to install SCR equipment on Hunter Units 1 and 2 and Huntington Units 1 and 2. The EPA approved the SIP revision with the BART alternative in October 2020. The EPA's actions also withdrew a prior FIP that required installation of SCR equipment on Hunter Units 1 and 2 and Huntington Units 1 and 2. On January 19, 2021, Heal Utah, National Parks Conservation Association, Sierra Club and Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment filed a petition for review of the Utah Regional Haze SIP Alternative in the Tenth Circuit. PacifiCorp and the state of Utah moved to intervene in the litigation. After review of the rule by the Biden administration, the EPA determined it would defend the rule and briefing has been completed. A date for oral arguments has not been scheduled. The Utah Air Quality Board approved the Utah Division of Air Quality's SIP for the regional haze second planning period on June 6, 2022. The SIP sets mass-based NOx emissions limits and rate-based SO2 limits for PacifiCorp's Hunter and Huntington generating facilities to ensure reasonable visibility progress for the second planning period.
The state of Wyoming issued two regional haze SIPs requiring the installation of SO2, NOx and particulate matter controls on certain PacifiCorp coal-fueled generating facilities in Wyoming. The EPA approved the SO2 SIP in December 2012 and the EPA's approval was upheld on appeal by the Tenth Circuit in October 2014. The EPA's final action on the Wyoming SIP in 2014 approved the state's plan to have PacifiCorp install low-NOx burners at Naughton Units 1 and 2, SCR controls at Naughton Unit 3 by December 2014, SCR controls at Jim Bridger Units 1 through 4 between 2015 and 2022, and low-NOx burners at Dave Johnston Unit 4. The EPA disapproved a portion of the Wyoming SIP and issued a FIP for Dave Johnston Unit 3, where it required the installation of SCR controls by 2019 or, in lieu of installing SCR controls, a commitment to shut down Dave Johnston Unit 3 by 2027, its currently approved depreciable life. The EPA also disapproved a portion of the Wyoming SIP and issued a FIP for the Wyodak coal-fueled generating facility, requiring the installation of SCR controls by 2019. PacifiCorp filed an appeal of the EPA's final action on Wyodak in March 2014. The state of Wyoming and several environmental groups also filed an appeal of the EPA's final action. In September 2014, the Tenth Circuit issued a stay of the March 2019 compliance deadline for Wyodak, pending further action by the Tenth Circuit in the appeal. The abatement on litigation was lifted September 28, 2022, and opening briefs were submitted in October 2022. PacifiCorp objects to the EPA's FIP requiring SCR on the Wyodak Unit. That requirement in the agency's plan remains stayed by the court. PacifiCorp has also intervened on behalf of the EPA against claims that Naughton Units 1 and 2 should have been subject to a SCR requirement. Separately, on February 14, 2022, the First Judicial District Court for the State of Wyoming entered a consent decree reached between the state of Wyoming and PacifiCorp resolving claims of threatened violations of the Clean Air Act, the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act and the Wyoming Air Quality Standards and Regulations at the Jim Bridger facility. No penalties were imposed under the consent decree. Consistent with the terms and conditions of the consent decree, PacifiCorp must convert both units to natural gas and begin meeting emissions limits consistent with that conversion by January 1, 2024. The EPA and PacifiCorp executed an administrative order on consent June 9, 2022, covering compliance for Jim Bridger Units 1 and 2 under the regional haze rule. The federal order contains the same emission and operating limits as the Wyoming consent decree and adds federal approval of the compliance pathway outlined in the state consent decree, including revision of the SIP to include conversion of Jim Bridger Units 1 and 2 to natural gas. The order includes a one-year deadline to complete the SIP revision. On December 30, 2022, the Wyoming Air Quality Division submitted the state-approved revised regional haze state implementation plan requiring natural gas conversion of Jim Bridger units 1 and 2 to the EPA for approval. The plan revision replaces a previous requirement for selective catalytic reduction at the units. The Wyoming Air Quality Division also issued an air permit for the natural gas conversion of Jim Bridger units 1 and 2 on December 28, 2022. The EPA is expected to conduct a separate federal public comment process on the plan. For the second round of regional haze planning, Wyoming determined that no controls will be necessary on any Wyoming resources to make reasonable progress.
The state of Colorado regional haze SIP requires SCR equipment at Craig Unit 2 and Hayden Units 1 and 2, in which PacifiCorp has ownership interests. Each of those regional haze compliance projects are in-service. In addition, in February 2015, the state of Colorado finalized an amendment to its regional haze SIP relating to Craig Unit 1, in which PacifiCorp has an ownership interest, to require the installation of SCR controls by 2021. In September 2016, the owners of Craig Units 1 and 2 reached an agreement with state and federal agencies and certain environmental groups that were parties to the previous settlement requiring SCR to retire Unit 1 by December 31, 2025, in lieu of SCR installation, or alternatively to remove the unit from coal-fueled service by August 31, 2021 with an option to convert the unit to natural gas by August 31, 2023, in lieu of SCR installation. The terms of the agreement were approved by the Colorado Air Quality Board in December 2016, incorporated into an amended Colorado regional haze SIP in 2017 and approved by the EPA in August 2018. PacifiCorp identified a December 31, 2025, retirement date for Craig Unit 1 in its 2017 and 2019 IRPs.
Nevada, Utah and Wyoming each submitted regional haze SIPs for the regional haze second planning period to the EPA in August 2022. The EPA has 18 months to approve or disapprove all or parts of the states' plans. On August 25, 2022, the EPA promulgated a finding of failure to submit a SIP for the regional haze second planning period for 15 states, including Iowa. The finding establishes a two-year deadline for the agency to promulgate FIPs to address the requirements, unless prior to promulgating a FIP, the state submits, and the agency approves, a SIP meeting the requirements. The finding says the agency intends to continue to work with states in developing approvable SIP submittals in a timely manner. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources continues to work with the EPA on development of its SIP. On February 13, 2023, Iowa issued a draft SIP and will accept comment on the draft plan through March 16, 2023. Iowa proposes to require operational improvements to existing control equipment at MidAmerican Energy Company's Louisa Generation Station and Walter Scott Jr. Energy Center - Unit 3. Iowa anticipates submitting a final plan to the EPA in spring 2023.
Climate Change
In December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goal of limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius and reaching a global peak of GHG emissions as soon as possible to achieve climate neutrality by mid-century; establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will get more aggressive. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the U.S. agreed to reduce GHG emissions 26% to 28% by 2025 from 2005 levels. After more than 55 countries representing more than 55% of global GHG emissions submitted their ratification documents, the Paris Agreement became effective November 4, 2016; however, the U.S. completed its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. President Biden accepted the terms of the climate agreement on January 20, 2021, and the U.S. completed its reentry February 19, 2021. New commitments to the Paris Agreement were announced in April 2021, with the U.S. pledging to cut its overall GHG emissions 50% to 52% from 2005 levels by 2030 and to reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. Increasingly, states are adopting legislation and regulations to reduce GHG emissions, and local governments and consumers are seeking increasing amounts of clean and renewable energy.
GHG Performance Standards
Affordable Clean Energy Rule
In June 2014, the EPA released proposed regulations to address GHG emissions from existing fossil-fueled generating facilities, referred to as the Clean Power Plan, under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The EPA's proposal calculated state-specific emission rate targets to be achieved based on the "best system of emission reduction." In August 2015, the final Clean Power Plan was released, which established the best system of emission reduction as including: (a) heat rate improvements; (b) increased utilization of existing combined-cycle natural gas-fueled generating facilities; and (c) increased deployment of new and incremental non-carbon generation placed in-service after 2012. The Clean Power Plan was stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court in February 2016 while litigation proceeded. On June 19, 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued the Affordable Clean Energy rule. In the Affordable Clean Energy rule, the EPA determined that the best system of emission reduction for existing coal-fueled generating facilities is limited to actions that can be taken at a point source facility, specifically heat rate improvements and identified a set of candidate technologies and measures that could improve heat rates. Measures taken to meet the standards of performance must be achieved at the source itself. The Affordable Clean Energy rule was challenged by environmental and health groups in the D.C. Circuit. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the Affordable Clean Energy rule to the EPA, finding that the rule "rested critically on a mistaken reading of the Clean Air Act" that limited the best system of emission reduction to actions taken at a facility. In October 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of that decision. Arguments in the case were held February 28, 2022, and on June 30, 2022 the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision regarding the scope of the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the "generation shifting" approach in the Clean Power Plan exceeded the powers granted to the EPA by Congress, although the court did not address whether the EPA may only adopt measures applied at the individual source as it did in the Affordable Clean Energy rule. A key area where the EPA went astray was using the Clean Power Plan to give states the option to promulgate regulations that would encourage "generation shifting," or moving away from higher-polluting power sources like coal to lower-polluting sources like natural gas or renewables. The U.S. Supreme Court found that type of regulation, which would impact larger economic forces beyond the fence lines of individual generating facilities, is not permitted under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit's vacatur of the Affordable Clean Energy rule and remanded the case for further proceedings. The ruling has no immediate impact on the Registrants, as there is no Section 111(d) rule currently in effect. The Biden administration plans to propose by March 2023 its own rule to replace the Clean Power Plan and Affordable Clean Energy rule.
New Source Performance Standards for Methane Emissions
In August 2020, the EPA finalized regulations to rescind standards for methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. The changes eliminate requirements to regulate methane emissions from the production, processing, transmission and storage of oil and gas. The rule was immediately challenged by environmental and tribal groups, as well as numerous states. In January 2021, the D.C. Circuit lifted an administrative stay and allowed the rule to take effect, finding that groups challenging the rule had not met the standard for a long-term stay. On June 30, 2021, President Biden signed into law a joint resolution of Congress, adopted under the Congressional Review Act, disapproving the August 2020 rule. The resolution reinstated the 2012 volatile organic compounds standards and the 2016 volatile organic compounds and methane standards for the oil and natural gas transmission and storage segments, as well as the methane standards for the production and processing segments of the oil and gas sector. On November 2, 2021, the EPA proposed rules that would reduce methane emissions from both new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas industry. The proposals would expand and strengthen emission reduction requirements for new, modified and reconstructed oil and natural gas sources and would require states to reduce methane emissions from existing sources nationwide. The EPA took comment on the proposed rules through January 31, 2022. The EPA issued a supplemental proposal in November 2022 to further strengthen emission reduction requirements and intends to finalize the rules by fall 2023. Until the rules are finalized, the relevant Registrants cannot determine the full impacts of the proposed rule.
Water Quality Standards
The Clean Water Act establishes the framework for maintaining and improving water quality in the U.S. through a program that regulates, among other things, discharges to and withdrawals from waterways. The Clean Water Act requires that cooling water intake structures reflect the "best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact" to aquatic organisms. After significant litigation, the EPA released a proposed rule under §316(b) of the Clean Water Act to regulate cooling water intakes at existing facilities. The final rule was released in May 2014 and became effective in October 2014. Under the final rule, existing facilities that withdraw at least 25% of their water exclusively for cooling purposes and have a design intake flow of greater than two million gallons per day are required to reduce fish impingement (i.e., when fish and other aquatic organisms are trapped against screens when water is drawn into a facility's cooling system) by choosing one of seven options. Facilities that withdraw at least 125 million gallons of water per day from waters of the U.S. must also conduct studies to help their permitting authority determine what site-specific controls, if any, would be required to reduce entrainment of aquatic organisms (i.e., when organisms are drawn into the facility). PacifiCorp's Dave Johnston generating facility and all of MidAmerican Energy's coal-fueled generating facilities, except Louisa, Ottumwa and Walter Scott, Jr. Unit 4, which have water cooling towers, withdraw more than 125 million gallons per day of water from waters of the U.S. for once-through cooling applications. PacifiCorp's Jim Bridger, Naughton, Gadsby, Hunter and Huntington generating facilities currently utilize closed cycle cooling towers but are designed to withdraw more than two million gallons of water per day. If PacifiCorp's or MidAmerican Energy's existing intake structures require modification, the costs are not anticipated to be significant to the consolidated financial statements. Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific are not impacted by the §316(b) final rule since they do not utilize once-through cooling water intake or discharge structures at any of their generating facilities.
In November 2015, the EPA published final effluent limitation guidelines and standards for the steam electric power generating sector which, among other things, regulate the discharge of bottom ash transport water, fly ash transport water, combustion residual leachate and non-chemical metal cleaning wastes. In November 2019, the EPA proposed updates to the 2015 rule, specifically addressing flue gas desulfurization wastewater and bottom ash transport water. The rule took effect in December 2020. The final rule changes the technology-basis for treatment of flue gas desulfurization wastewater and bottom ash transport water, revises the voluntary incentives program for flue gas desulfurization wastewater, and adds subcategories for high-flow units, low utilization units, and those that will transition away from coal combustion by 2028. While most of the issues raised by this rule are already being addressed through the CCR rule and are not expected to impose significant additional requirements, the Dave Johnston generating facility is impacted by the rule's bottom ash handling requirements at Units 1 and 2. The generating facility submitted notice to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality that it will either achieve a cessation of coal combustion at Units 1 and 2 by December 31, 2028, or install bottom ash transport treatment technology by December 31, 2025. The EPA anticipates proposing additional changes to the rule in spring 2023 to resolve outstanding issues from litigation.
In April 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps of Engineers") issued a joint proposal to address "waters of the United States" to clarify protection under the Clean Water Act for streams and wetlands. The proposed rule comes as a result of U.S. Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 that created confusion regarding jurisdictional waters that were subject to permitting under either nationwide or individual permitting requirements. The final rule was released in May 2015 but was appealed in multiple courts and a nationwide stay on the implementation of the rule was issued in October 2015. On June 9, 2021, the EPA and the Corps of Engineers announced their intention to again revise the definition of "waters of the United States." In December 2022, the agencies released a final rule updating the definition of "waters of the United States." The final rule generally restores and is broader than the pre-2015 "waters of the United States" definition and incorporates both the "relatively permanent" and "significant nexus" standards from U.S. Supreme Court decisions.
Coal Ash Disposal
In April 2015, the EPA released a final rule to regulate the management and disposal of coal combustion residuals (CCR) under the RCRA. The rule regulates coal combustion byproducts as non-hazardous waste under RCRA Subtitle D and establishes minimum nationwide standards for the disposal of CCR. Under the final rule, surface impoundments and landfills utilized for coal combustion byproducts will need to be closed unless they can meet the more stringent regulatory requirements. 
At the time the rule was published in April 2015, PacifiCorp operated 18 surface impoundments and seven landfills that contained coal combustion byproducts. Prior to the effective date of the rule in October 2015, nine surface impoundments and three landfills were either closed or repurposed to no longer receive coal combustion byproducts and hence are not subject to the final rule. As PacifiCorp proceeded to implement the final coal combustion rule, it was determined that two surface impoundments located at the Dave Johnston generating facility were hydraulically connected and effectively constitute a single impoundment. In November 2017, a new surface impoundment was placed into service at the Naughton Generating Station. At the time the rule was published in April 2015, MidAmerican Energy owned or operated nine surface impoundments and four landfills that contain coal combustion byproducts. Prior to the effective date of the rule in October 2015, MidAmerican Energy closed or repurposed six surface impoundments to no longer receive coal combustion byproducts. Five of these surface impoundments were closed on or before December 21, 2017, and the sixth is undergoing closure. At the time the rule was published in April 2015, the Nevada Utilities operated 10 evaporative surface impoundments and two landfills that contained coal combustion byproducts. Prior to the effective date of the rule in October 2015, the Nevada Utilities closed four of the surface impoundments, four impoundments discontinued receipt of coal combustion byproducts making them inactive and two surface impoundments remain active and subject to the final rule. The two landfills remain active and subject to the final rule. 
Multiple parties filed challenges over various aspects of the final rule in the D.C. Circuit, resulting in settlement of some of the issues and subsequent regulatory action by the EPA. The EPA finalized the first phase of the CCR rule amendments in July 2018 (the "Phase 1, Part 1 rule"). In addition to adopting alternative performance standards and revising groundwater performance standards for certain constituents, the EPA extended the deadline by which facilities must initiate closure of unlined ash ponds exceeding a groundwater protection standard and impoundments that do not meet the rule's aquifer location restrictions to October 31, 2020. Following submittal of competing motions from environmental groups and the EPA to stay or remand this deadline extension, on March 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA's request to remand the rule and left the October 31, 2020 deadline in place while the agency undertakes a new rulemaking establishing a new deadline for initiating closure. On August 14, 2019, the EPA released its "Phase 2" proposal, which contains targeted amendments to the CCR rule in response to court remands and EPA settlement agreements, as well as issues raised in a rulemaking petition. The Phase 2 rule has not been finalized. In February 2020, the EPA proposed a federal CCR permit program as required by the WIIN Act of 2016. The federal permit rule has not been finalized. In October 2020, the EPA released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking on legacy CCR surface impoundments, seeking comment on and information related to issues relevant to development of regulations for legacy impoundments. The EPA has not undertaken additional rulemaking related to the advanced notice. Until the proposals are finalized and fully litigated, the Registrants cannot determine whether additional action may be required.
In August 2020, the EPA finalized its Holistic Approach to Closure: Part A rule ("Part A rule"). This proposal addressed the D.C. Circuit's revocation of the provisions that allow unlined impoundments to continue receiving ash. The Part A rule established a new deadline of April 11, 2021, by which all unlined surface impoundments must initiate closure. The Part A rule also identifies two extensions to that date: (1) a site-specific extension to develop alternate disposal capacity and initiate closure by October 15, 2023; and (2) a site-specific extension for facilities that agree to shut down the coal-fueled unit and complete ash pond closure activities by October 17, 2028. PacifiCorp developed a demonstration for the development of alternative capacity for the Jim Bridger facility's FGD Pond 2 and a demonstration for closure of the Naughton facility and ash pond and submitted them to the EPA in November 2020. On January 11, 2022, the EPA deemed these submittals complete but has not taken additional action on them. No other Registrants used the provisions of the Part A rule.
Notwithstanding the status of the final CCR rule, citizens' suits have been filed against regulated entities seeking judicial relief for contamination alleged to have been caused by releases of coal combustion byproducts. Some of these cases have been successful in imposing liability upon companies if coal combustion byproducts contaminate groundwater that is ultimately released or connected to surface water. In addition, actions have been filed against regulated entities seeking to require that surface impoundments containing CCR be subject to closure by removal rather than being allowed to effectuate closure in place as provided under the final rule. The Registrants are not a party to these lawsuits and until they are resolved, the Registrants cannot predict the impact on overall compliance obligations.
Other
Other laws, regulations and agencies to which the relevant Registrants are subject include, but are not limited to:
•The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and similar state laws may require any current or former owners or operators of a disposal site, as well as transporters or generators of hazardous substances sent to such disposal site, to share in environmental remediation costs. Certain Registrants have been identified as potentially responsible parties in connection with certain disposal sites. The relevant Registrants have completed several cleanup actions and are participating in ongoing investigations and remedial actions. Costs associated with these actions are not expected to be material and are expected to be found prudent and included in rates.
•The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, under which the DOE is responsible for the selection and development of repositories for, and the permanent disposal of, spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive wastes. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Note 11 of the Notes to Financial Statements of MidAmerican Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding MidAmerican Energy's nuclear decommissioning obligations.
•The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 and similar state statutes establish operational, reclamation and closure standards that must be met during and upon completion of PacifiCorp's mining activities. 
•The FERC evaluates hydroelectric systems to ensure environmental impacts are minimized, including the issuance of environmental impact statements for licensed projects both initially and upon relicensing. The FERC monitors the hydroelectric facilities for compliance with the license terms and conditions, which include environmental provisions. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of PacifiCorp in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding PacifiCorp's Klamath River hydroelectric system.
The Registrants expect they will be allowed to recover their respective prudently incurred costs to comply with the environmental laws and regulations discussed above. The Registrants' planning efforts take into consideration the complexity of balancing factors such as: (a) pending environmental regulations and requirements to reduce emissions, address waste disposal, ensure water quality and protect wildlife; (b) avoidance of excessive reliance on any one generation technology; (c) costs and trade-offs of various resource options including energy efficiency, demand response programs and renewable generation; (d) state-specific energy policies, resource preferences and economic development efforts; (e) additional transmission investment to reduce power costs and increase efficiency and reliability of the integrated transmission system; and (f) keeping rates affordable. Due to the number of generating units impacted by environmental regulations, deferring installation of compliance-related projects is often not feasible or cost effective and places the Registrants at risk of not having access to necessary capital, material, and labor while attempting to perform major equipment installations in a compressed timeframe concurrent with other utilities across the country. Therefore, the Registrants have established installation schedules with permitting agencies that coordinate compliance timeframes with construction and tie-in of major environmental compliance projects as units are scheduled off-line for planned maintenance outages; these coordinated efforts help reduce costs associated with replacement power and maintain system reliability.
