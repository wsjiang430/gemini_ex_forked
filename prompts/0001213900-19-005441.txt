ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We plan to be the worldwide industry leader in the production and manufacturing of raw cannabis and hemp plant ingredients for both medical and industrial uses. We have received licenses to cultivate, produce and distribute the raw ingredients of the cannabis and hemp plant for medicinal, scientific and industrial purposes. Specifically, we are one of the first companies in Colombia to receive licenses for seed, cultivation, extraction and export from the Colombian government (the “Licenses”).
 
Our primary cultivation site is located in Popayan, Colombia. Currently, we own approximately 30 acres and have a covered greenhouse built specifically to cultivate high-grade cannabis and hemp, with 221 acres available for expansion under an exclusive contract. We use innovative, proprietary cannabis micropropagation techniques to cultivate stable, robust, genetically superior cannabis and hemp derived products. We produce under GAP/GMP/EU Pharmacopoeia standards and intend for our products to be available and accessible to all large-scale purchasers at market competitive price points. Due to our proximity to the equator, we are able to grow year-round.
 
The plants are first processed into crude cannabis oil using ethanol. We further process the crude cannabis oil into distillate using a film wipe distillation machine which removes unwanted contaminates. We can further process the distillate into isolate resulting in a pure isolate powder with 99% purity. We are able to sell off the product at the end of any of these processes. Our primary products are crude cannabis, distillate and isolate.
 
We planted our first crop of cannabis in 2018, which we expect to begin harvesting in the first quarter of 2019. To date, we have not yet generated any revenues from our activities.
 
History and Background
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on September 2, 2014 as Punto Group, Corp., and changed our name to One World Pharma, Inc. on January 10, 2019. On February 21, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with OWP Merger Subsidiary, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and OWP Ventures, Inc. (“OWP Ventures”), which is the parent company of One World Pharma SAS, a Colombian company (“OWP Colombia”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we acquired OWP Ventures (and indirectly, OWP Colombia) by the merger of OWP Merger Subsidiary with and into OWP Ventures, with OWP Ventures being the surviving entity as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). The closing of the Merger occurred on February 21, 2019. As a result of the Merger, among other things, (a) holders of the outstanding capital stock of OWP Ventures received an aggregate of 39,475,398 shares of our common stock; (b) options to purchase 825,000 shares of common stock of OWP Ventures at an exercise price of $0.50 automatically converted into options to purchase 825,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.50; (c) the outstanding principal and interest under a $300,000 convertible note issued by OWP Ventures became convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser of $0.424 per share or 80% of the price we sell our common stock in a future “Qualified Offering”;(d) 875,000 shares of our common stock owned by OWP Ventures prior to the Merger were cancelled; and (e) OWP Ventures’s chief operating officer became our chief operating officer and two of OWP Ventures’s directors became members of our board of directors. Immediately prior to the Merger, we were a public “shell” company with nominal assets. As a result of the Merger, we are engaged in OWP Ventures’s business, including the business of OWP Colombia, its wholly-owned subsidiary.

OWP Colombia was formed on July 14, 2017 with the goal of procuring the cannabis licenses described below. On December 20, 2017, OWP Colombia received its first license for the manufacture of cannabis derivatives for domestic use and export, allowing it to extract high tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) compounds (“Cannabis Manufacturing License”). On December 26, 2017, OWP Colombia received its license to use seeds for sowing for domestic use and export, allowing for genetic and seed bank registration (“Cannabis Seed Possession License”). On December 26, 2017, OWP Colombia received its license to grow non-psychoactive cannabis plants (less than 1.0% THC). Under this license, OWP Colombia can produce seeds for planting, manufacturing of derivatives and industrial purposes (“Cannabis Non-Psychoactive Cultivation License”). On January 4, 2018, OWP Colombia received its license to grow psychoactive cannabis plants (greater than 1.0% THC) (“Psychoactive Cultivation License”).
 
On March 27, 2018, OWP Ventures was formed as a Ventures corporation for the purpose of acquiring OWP Colombia. On May 30, 2018, OWP Ventures entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with the shareholders of OWP Colombia whereby the shareholders of OWP Colombia transferred their shares in OWP Colombia to OWP Ventures in exchange for 10,200,000 shares of common stock of OWP Ventures.
 
OWP Colombia planted its first crop of cannabis in 2018, which it expects to begin harvesting in the first quarter of 2019. To date, we have not yet generated any revenues from our activities.
 
Products
 
We are focused on cultivating, processing and supplying cannabis oil, distillate and isolate to customers’ specification. We plan to sell as a wholesaler to industrial companies making cannabis related products. We are currently in the process of cultivating medicinal cannabis at our facility in Popayán, Colombia for a variety of medical conditions. We have registered 15 varieties or strains of cannabis with the Colombian Ministry of Health and intend to register an additional 65 varieties by the end of 2019. See “Operations - Strains of Cannabis”. The development of these strains enables us to select mother plants and identify the concentrations of cannabinoids required for the formulations which we intend to distribute. The cannabis will be produced in accordance with GMP Standards. We are committed to developing final products consistent with medicinal cannabis industry standards and pharmaceutical procedures. Our products will include a variety of cannabinoids and terpenes designed to treat specific medical conditions. The composition of the strains will include a wide range of THC and CBD ratios.
Industry
 
Medicinal cannabis refers to the use of cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids and terpenes to treat disease or ameliorate symptoms such as pain, muscle spasticity, nausea and other indications. Cannabinoid is a blanket term covering a family of complex chemicals, both natural and man-made, that bind with cannabinoid receptors (protein molecules on the surface of cells) and effect a wide number of responses. Cannabinoid receptors in the human body are part of a system called the endocannabinoid system. This system produces chemicals called endocannabinoids, which also bind with cannabinoid receptors. Cannabinoid receptors are found in the brain and throughout the body. Scientists have found that cannabinoid receptors in the endocannabinoid system are involved in a vast array of functions in our bodies, including helping to modulate brain and nerve activity (including memory and pain), energy metabolism, heart function, the immune system and even reproduction. While there are a large number of active cannabinoids found in cannabis, the two most common currently used for medical purposes are tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol. Although no clinical trials have been completed in the United States to validate the effectiveness of tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabidiol in managing disease and improving symptoms, scientific studies have identified that they, alone and/or in combination, have potential to provide treatment benefits for a large number of medical conditions. For example, tetrahydrocannabinol, a psychotropic cannabinoid, has been shown to activate pathways in the central nervous system which work to block pain signals and has shown potential to assist patients with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and stimulate appetite in patients following chemotherapy. Cannabidiol, on the other hand, is non-psychotropic and has shown potential to relieve convulsion and inflammation. Various third-party studies suggest that medicinal cannabis (with varying dosages of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol) has shown, or has the potential to show, efficacy for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, anxiety, arthritis, brain injuries, cancer (chemotherapy), chronic nausea, chronic pain, eating disorders, epilepsy, fibromyalgia, glaucoma, Hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS, migraines, Multiple Sclerosis, muscle spasms, Parkinson’s disease, Chrohn’s Disease and PTSD.

Regulation
 
Licenses
 
Under Colombian law, there are four types of cannabis licenses that authorize different activities concerning the various stages of the production line of the medical cannabis industry: (i) the Cannabis Seeds Possession License; (ii) the Cannabis Psychoactive Cultivation License; (iii) the Cannabis Non-Psychoactive Cultivation License; and (iv) the Cannabis Manufacturing and Distribution License. We possess all four licenses.
 
The legal framework currently in force in Colombia regarding medical cannabis is established in Law 1787 of 2016 (the “Law”) and the Decree 613 of 2017 (the “Decree”). Cannabis licenses must be issued by the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Justice in an estimated time of sixty (60) days. In accordance with Colombia’s international obligations, there is a limit in the amount of Cannabis allowed for fabrication or cultivation assigned by the Colombian Government (specific crop or manufacturing quotas) that must be requested by licensee when applying for a Cannabis Psychoactive Cultivation License or a Cannabis Manufacturing License. The activities of cultivation and manufacturing can only be started once the specific quotas have been granted to the licensee.
 
Quotas 
 
As described above, regulations of cannabis in Colombia provides an additional requirement applicable to obtaining a Cannabis Psychoactive Cultivation License and a Cannabis Manufacturing License, both of which are only granted with crop and manufacturing quotas (the “Quotas”). According to Article 2.8.11.2.6.2 of the Decree, the assignment of Quotas is collectively made by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Justice, the ICA, the National Food and Drug Surveillance Institute (INVIMA), and the National Narcotics Fund.
 
According to Article 2.8.11.2.6.5 of the Decree, there are two types of Quotas: (i) crop quotas of psychoactive cannabis (for holders of the Cannabis Psychoactive Cultivation License) that are granted by the Ministry of Justice; and (ii) the manufacturing quotas of psychoactive cannabis (for holders of the Cannabis Manufacturing License) that are granted by the Ministry of Health.
 
These Quotas are requested by the licensees no later than the last calendar day of April of each year, and, if they are granted by the appropriate authority, they can only be used by the licensees during the next calendar year (for instance, if a licensee requests a specific crop Quota in March, 2018, and this Quota is granted by the Ministry of Justice, the licensee will be allowed to use the Quota from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019). In extraordinary events, the licensees can request a supplementary Quota that will apply to the calendar year requested (the issuance of these Quotas depends on the special circumstances defined by the Colombian governmental authorities).
 
Duration of Licenses
 
The Cannabis Psychoactive Cultivation License, the Cannabis Non-Psychoactive License, and the Cannabis Manufacturing and Distribution License are granted by the Colombian government when the applicant fulfills the general criteria described in the Article 2.8.11.2.1.5 of the Decree, and the specific requirements for each type of license. Each of these licenses is valid for up to five (5) years. The Colombian government maintains the right to monitor the activities performed by the corresponding licensee.

Strains of Cannabis 
 
Strains of cannabis are registered in Colombia in two manners:
 

● | Registration of the Genetic Pool or ¨Fuente Semillera¨: Under Article 2.8.11.11.1 of the Decree, licensed producers of cannabis have until December 31, 2018 to register the genetics of strands of cannabis with the ICA. Under this transitory Article, the government allowed a limited period for licensed producers of cannabis to source genetics currently available in Colombia and register these as their “fuente semillera”. We have registered 15 varieties under this Article, and intend to register an additional 65 varieties by the end of 2019. This registration enables us to grow our own strands of cannabis as opposed to having to purchase registered strands from other licensed producers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Registration Under the ¨Registro Nacional de Cultivares Comerciales¨: Licensed producers of cannabis have to be granted a breeding/research license to be able to develop, select and trial stabilized cannabis cultivars. This registration allows licensed producers to register unique and stable varieties of cannabis for commercial production within Colombia. We were granted such license in the first quarter of 2018. Licensed producers can then request from ICA a registration trial, which is a field flowering trial with the supervision of ICA officials. The data collected in these trials can lead to registration of the cultivar in the National Registrar. Only registered varieties will be allowed to be produced commercially. We are in the final phase of field flowering trials and anticipate having up to 65 registrations by the end of 2019. 

Environmental
 
Under Colombian law, general principles of environmental law are set out in Law 99 of 1993 and Article 9 of the National Code of Natural Resources and Protection of the Environment. These laws establish principles governing the use of natural resources, including that use must occur without causing harm to the interests of the community or of third parties. Parties that cause environmental damage while acting under the authority of a permit are responsible for incurring the costs to rectify the damage. The imposition of environmental sanctions is in addition to civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed. Environmental damage caused while a party is acting without a license constitutes a breach of Law 99 of 1993 and may lead to the imposition of sanctions, in addition to civil or criminal proceedings that may result. Parties that cause environmental damage, in addition to sanctions or penalties that apply, will also be required to carry out studies to assess the characteristics of the damage. Under Colombian law, liability for environmental damage creates a presumption of liability in case of a: (i) breach of environmental laws; (ii) environmental damage; and (iii) breach of environmental license or any other administrative act from the environmental authorities. The Environmental Authorities may investigate potential claims, authorize preventative measures, or impose sanctions on parties breaching environmental law.
Competition
 
The market for medicinal cannabis is characterized by unsatisfied patient demand, with few authorized producers. Although competition in the market is growing and Colombia offers an open process to apply for the licenses, we believe we are competitively positioned to satisfy the demand for medicinal cannabis given our early entry into the market, the management team’s expertise in medical product branding, marketing, quality control and domestic market relationships. Our competitors are primarily focused on generating low cost products for international export as base extractors, as opposed to our approach of creating branded product formulations for the domestic and international markets. Cultivation in Colombia has natural cost advantages. However, management believes the more sustainable competitive advantage is to create patient loyalty and brand preference, as opposed to the distribution of more homogeneous products. Domestically our competition consists of PharmaCielo, CannaVida, Empresa Colombiana de Cannabis, Khiron Life Sciences Corp., MedCan, Canopy Growth Corporation, and Clever Leaves.
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology.
Seasonality
 
Colombia and its vertical offering of microclimates is the ideal country for year-round growing and processing of all possible varieties of cannabis in a natural, environmentally friendly manner.
