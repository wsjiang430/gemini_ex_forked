Item 1. Business
General
EPR Properties (“we,” “us,” “our,” “EPR” or the “Company”) was formed on August 22, 1997 as a Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”), and an initial public offering of our common shares of beneficial interest (“common shares”) was completed on November 18, 1997. Since that time, the Company has grown into a leading specialty REIT with an investment portfolio that includes primarily entertainment, recreation and education properties. The underwriting of our investments is centered on key industry and property cash flow criteria, as well as the credit metrics of our tenants and customers. As further explained under “Growth Strategies” below, our investments are also guided by a focus on inflection opportunities that are associated with or support enduring uses, excellent executions, attractive economics and an advantageous market position. 
We are a self-administered REIT. As of December 31, 2018, our total assets were approximately $6.1 billion (after accumulated depreciation of approximately $0.9 billion). Our investments are generally structured as long-term triple-net leases that require the tenants to pay substantially all expenses associated with the operation and maintenance of the property, or as long-term mortgages with economics similar to our triple-net lease structure.
Our total investments (a non-GAAP financial measure) were approximately $6.9 billion at December 31, 2018. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for the calculation of total investments and reconciliation of total investments to "Total assets" in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 and 2017. We group our investments into four reportable operating segments: Entertainment, Recreation, Education and Other. Our total investments at December 31, 2018 consisted of interests in the following:

• | $3.0 billion or 43% related to entertainment properties, which includes megaplex theatres, entertainment retail centers (centers typically anchored by an entertainment component such as a megaplex theatre and containing other entertainment-related or retail properties), family entertainment centers and other retail parcels;


• | $2.3 billion or 33% related to recreation properties, which includes ski properties, attractions, golf entertainment complexes and other recreation facilities;


• | $1.4 billion or 21% related to education properties, which consists of investments in public charter schools, early education centers and K-12 private schools; and


• | $194.9 million or 3% related to other properties, which relates to the Resorts World Catskills (formerly Adelaar) casino and resort project in Sullivan County, New York.

We believe entertainment, recreation and education are highly enduring sectors of the real estate industry and that, as a result of our focus on properties in these sectors, industry relationships and the knowledge of our management, we have a competitive advantage in providing capital to operators of these types of properties. We believe this focused niche approach, particularly as it relates to experiential real estate, aligns with the trends in consumer demand, and offers the potential for higher growth and better yields.
We believe our management’s knowledge and industry relationships have facilitated favorable opportunities for us to acquire, finance and lease properties. Historically, our primary challenges have been locating suitable properties, negotiating favorable lease or financing terms, and managing our real estate portfolio as we have continued to grow. 
We are particularly focused on property categories which allow us to use our experience to mitigate some of the risks inherent in a changing economic environment. We cannot provide any assurance that any such potential investment or acquisition opportunities will arise in the near future, or that we will actively pursue any such opportunities.

Although we are primarily a long-term investor, we may also sell assets if we believe that it is in the best interest of our shareholders or pursuant to contractual rights of our tenants or our customers.
Entertainment 
As of December 31, 2018, our Entertainment segment consisted of investments in megaplex theatres, entertainment retail centers, family entertainment centers and other retail parcels totaling approximately $3.0 billion with interests in:

• | 152 megaplex theatres located in 35 states;


• | seven entertainment retail centers (which included seven additional megaplex theatres) located in three states, and Canada;


• | 11 family entertainment centers located in six states;


• | land parcels leased to restaurant and retail operators adjacent to several of our theatre properties;


• | $20.0 million in construction in progress primarily for real estate development and redevelopment of megaplex theatres as well as other retail redevelopment projects; and


• | $4.5 million in undeveloped land inventory.

As of December 31, 2018, our owned real estate portfolio of megaplex theatres consisted of approximately 11.3 million square feet and was 100% leased and our remaining owned entertainment real estate portfolio consisted of 2.1 million square feet and was 90% leased. The combined owned entertainment real estate portfolio consisted of 13.4 million square feet and was 98% leased. Our owned theatre properties are leased to 15 different leading theatre operators. A significant portion of our total revenue was derived from rental payments by American Multi-Cinema, Inc. ("AMC"). For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately $115.8 million or 16.5% of the Company's total revenues were derived from rental payments by AMC. 
A significant portion of our entertainment assets consist of modern megaplex theatres. The modern megaplex theatre provides a significantly enhanced audio and visual experience for the patrons versus other formats. A significant trend currently exists among national and local exhibitors to further enhance the customer experience. These enhancements include reserved, luxury seating and expanded food and beverage offerings, including the addition of alcohol and more efficient point of sale systems. The evolution of the theatre industry over the last 20 years from the sloped floor theatre to the megaplex stadium theatre to the expanded amenity theatre has demonstrated that exhibitors and their landlords are willing to make investments in their theatres to take the customer experience to the next level. 
As exhibitors improve the customer experience with more spacious and comfortable seating options, they are required to make physical changes to the existing seating configurations that typically result in a significant loss of existing seats. It was once a concern that such seat loss would be a negative to theatres that thrive on opening weekend business of new movie releases; however, customers have responded favorably to these changes. Exhibitors are learning that enhanced amenities are changing the patrons’ movie-going habits resulting in significantly increased seat utilization and increased food and beverage revenue. 
As exhibitors pursue the renovation of theatres with enhanced amenities, we are working with our tenants, generally toward the end of their primary lease terms, to extend the terms of their leases beyond the initial option periods, finance improvements where applicable and to recapture land where seat count reductions alleviate parking requirements. In conjunction with these changes, we may also make changes to the rental rates to better reflect the existing market demands and additional capital invested. In addition to positioning expiring theatre assets for continued success, the renovation of these assets creates an opportunity to diversify the Company's tenant base into other entertainment or retail uses adjacent to a movie theatre. 
The theatre box office had a record year in 2018 with revenues of approximately $11.9 billion per Box Office Mojo, an increase of over 7% versus the prior year and an increase of over 4% versus the previous record year set in 2016. We expect the development of new megaplex theatres and the conversion or partial conversion of existing theatres to enhanced amenity formats to continue in the United States and abroad over the long-term. As a result of the significant 
2

capital commitment involved in building new megaplex theatres and redeveloping existing theatres, as well as the experience and industry relationships of our management, we believe we will continue to have opportunities to provide capital to exhibition businesses in the future.
We also continue to seek opportunities for the development of additional restaurant, retail and other entertainment venues around our existing portfolio. The opportunity to capitalize on the traffic generation of our market-dominant theatres to create entertainment retail centers (“ERCs”) not only strengthens the execution of the megaplex theatre but adds diversity to our tenant and asset base. We have and will continue to evaluate our existing portfolio for additional development of entertainment and retail density, and we will also continue to evaluate the purchase or financing of existing ERCs that have demonstrated strong financial performance and meet our quality standards. The leasing and property management requirements of our ERCs are generally met through the use of third-party professional service providers.
Our family entertainment center operators offer a variety of entertainment options including bowling, bocce ball and karting. 
We will continue to seek opportunities for the development of, or acquisition of, other entertainment related properties that leverage our expertise in this area. 
Recreation
As of December 31, 2018, our Recreation segment consisted of investments in ski properties, attractions, golf entertainment complexes and other recreation properties totaling approximately $2.3 billion with interests in:

• | 12 ski properties located in seven states;


• | 21 attractions located in 13 states;


• | 34 golf entertainment complexes located in 19 states;


• | 13 other recreation properties located in six states; and


• | $249.9 million in construction in progress primarily for the development of an indoor waterpark hotel at the Resorts World Catskills casino and resort project located in Sullivan County, New York and golf entertainment complexes.

As of December 31, 2018, our owned recreation real estate portfolio was 100% leased. 
Our ski properties provide a sustainable advantage for the experience conscious consumer, providing outdoor entertainment in the winter and, in some cases, year-round. All of the ski properties that serve as collateral for our mortgage notes in this area, as well as our five owned properties, offer snowmaking capabilities and provide a variety of terrains and vertical drop options. We believe that the primary appeal of our ski properties lies in the convenient and reliable experience consumers can expect. Given that all of our ski properties are located near major metropolitan areas, they offer skiing, snowboarding and other activities without the expense, travel, or lengthy preparations of remote ski resorts. Furthermore, advanced snowmaking capabilities increase the reliability of the experience during the winter versus other ski properties that do not have such capabilities. Our ski properties are leased to, or we have mortgage notes receivable from, five different operators. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities in this area. 
Our attraction portfolio consists of waterparks (including related lodging), amusement parks and an interactive museum, each of which draw a diverse segment of customers. Our attraction operators continue to deliver innovative and compelling attractions along with high standards of service, making our attractions a day of fun that's accessible for families, teens, locals and tourists. These attractions offer experiences designed to appeal to all ages while remaining accessible in both cost and proximity. As many waterparks are growing from single-day attendance to a destination getaway, we believe indoor waterpark hotels increase the four-season appeal at many resorts. Our attraction properties are leased to, or we have mortgage notes receivable from, eight different operators. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities in this area.

Our golf entertainment complexes combine golf with entertainment, competition and food and beverage service, and are leased to, or under mortgage with, Topgolf. By combining an interactive entertainment and food and beverage experience with a long-lived recreational activity, we believe Topgolf provides an innovative, enjoyable and repeatable customer experience. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities related to golf entertainment complexes.
Our other recreation portfolio consists of both classic and innovative activities and includes investments in fitness and wellness properties, recreation anchored lodging and indoor sky-diving facilities. Our investments in recreation anchored lodging (including lodging associated with indoor waterparks included in our attraction portfolio) have been structured using triple-net leases or more traditional REIT lodging structures. In the traditional REIT lodging structure, we hold qualified lodging facilities under the REIT and we separately hold the operations of the facilities in taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs") which are facilitated by management agreements with eligible independent contractors. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities for investments in recreation anchored lodging under either triple-net leases or more traditional REIT lodging structures.
We will continue to seek opportunities for the development of, or acquisition of, other recreation related properties that leverage our expertise in this area. 
Education
As of December 31, 2018, our Education segment consisted of investments in public charter schools, early education centers and K-12 private schools totaling approximately $1.4 billion with interests in:

• | 59 public charter schools located in 19 states;


• | 69 early education centers located in 21 states;


• | 15 private schools located in nine states;


• | $17.6 million in construction in progress for real estate development or expansions of public charter schools and early education centers; and


• | $9.6 million in undeveloped land inventory.

As of December 31, 2018, our owned education real estate portfolio consisted of approximately 4.7 million square feet and was 98% leased. This includes properties operated by Children's Learnings Adventure USA, LLC (“CLA”) as 100% leased, as further discussed in Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments”.
Public charter schools are tuition-free, independent schools that are publicly funded by local, state and federal tax dollars based on enrollment. Driven by the need to improve the quality of public education and provide more school choices in the U.S., public charter schools are one of the fastest growing segments of the multi-billion dollar educational facilities sector, and we believe a critical need exists for the financing of new and refurbished educational facilities. To meet this need, we have established relationships with public charter school operators, authorizers and developers across the country. Public charter schools are operated pursuant to charters granted by various state or other regulatory authorities and are dependent upon funding from local, state and federal tax dollars. Like public schools, public charter schools are required to meet both state and federal academic standards. We have 44 different operators for our owned public charter schools. 
Various government bodies that provide educational funding have pressure to reduce their spending budgets and have reduced educational funding in some cases and may continue to reduce educational funding in the future. This can impact our tenants' operations and potentially their ability to pay our scheduled rent. However, these reductions differ state by state and have historically been more significant at the post-secondary education level than at the K-12 level that our tenants serve. Furthermore, while there can be no assurance as to the level of these cuts, we analyze each state's fiscal situation and commitment to the charter school movement before providing financing in a new state, and also factor in anticipated reductions (as applicable) in the states in which we do decide to do business.

As with public charter schools, the Company's expansion into both early education centers and private schools is supported by strong unmet demand, and we expect to increase our investment in both of these areas. 
Early education centers continue to see demand due to the proliferation of dual income families and the increasing emphasis on early childhood education, beyond traditional daycare. There is increased demand for curriculum-based, child-centered learning. We believe this property type is a logical extension of our education platform and allows us to increase our diversity and geographical reach with these assets. We have 11 different operators for our owned early education centers. 
We believe K-12 private schools have significant growth potential when they have differentiated, high quality offerings. Many private schools in large urban and suburban areas are at capacity and have large waiting lists making admission more difficult. The demand for nonsectarian private education has increased in recent years as parents and students become more focused on the comprehensive impact of a strong school environment. 
We will continue to seek opportunities for the development of, or acquisition of, other education related properties that leverage our expertise in this area. 
Many of our education lease and mortgage agreements contain purchase or prepayment options whereby the tenant or borrower can acquire the property or prepay the mortgage loan for a premium over the total development cost at certain points during the terms of the agreements. If these properties meet certain criteria, the tenants may be able to obtain bond or other financing at lower rates and therefore be motivated to exercise these options. We do not anticipate that all of these options will be exercised but cannot determine at this time the amount of such option exercises. Additionally, it is difficult to forecast when these options will be exercised, which can create volatility in our earnings. In accordance with GAAP, prepayment penalties related to mortgage agreements are included in mortgage and other financing income and are included in Funds From Operations ("FFO") as adjusted (See Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Funds From Operations” for a discussion of FFO and FFO as adjusted ("FFOAA"), which are non-GAAP measures). However, if a tenant exercises the option to purchase a property under lease, GAAP requires that a gain on sale be recognized for the amount of cash received over the carrying value of the property and gains on sale are typically excluded from FFOAA. Accordingly, for consistency in presentation and with the wording and intent of the lease provisions, we treat the premium over the total development cost (i.e. the undepreciated cost) as a termination fee and include such fees in FFOAA, and only the difference between the total development cost and the carrying value is treated as gain on sale and excluded from FFOAA. 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received prepayment of $38.1 million on five mortgage notes receivable that were secured by four public charter schools and land located in Arizona and we received associated prepayment fees of $3.4 million. In addition, pursuant to a tenant purchase option, we completed the sale of one public charter school located in California for net proceeds of $12.0 million. In connection with this sale, we recognized a gain on sale of $1.9 million, which has been included in termination fees in FFOAA per the methodology discussed above.

As of December 31, 2018, an estimate of the number of education properties potentially impacted by option exercises, the total development cost and the total potential amount of the prepayment penalties or lease termination fees in the option period by year are as follows (dollars in thousands): 

Year Option Exercisable | Number of Education Properties | Total Development Cost | | Total Potential Termination Fees/Prepayment Penalties in Option Period
2019 | 10 | $ | 122,833 | | | $ | 19,152
2020 | 15 | 126,896 | | | 22,967 | 
2021 | 13 | 131,709 | | | 22,103 | 
2022 | 4 | 40,160 | | | 8,915 | 
2023 | — | — | | | — | 
Thereafter | 4 | 155,888 | | | 22,746 | 

Other
As of December 31, 2018, our Other segment consisted primarily of land under ground lease, property under development and land held for development totaling approximately $194.9 million related to the Resorts World Catskills casino and resort project in Sullivan County, New York, which we previously referred to as the Adelaar casino and resort project. Our ground lease tenant is expected to ultimately invest in excess of $925.0 million in the construction of the casino and resort project, and the casino first opened for business in February 2018. 
Business Objectives and Strategies
Our vision is to become the leading specialty REIT by focusing our unique knowledge and resources on select real estate segments which provide the potential for outsized returns.
Our long-term primary business objective is to enhance shareholder value by achieving predictable and increasing FFO and dividends per share (See Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Funds From Operations” for a discussion of FFO, which is a non-GAAP measure). Our prevailing strategy is to focus on long-term investments in a limited number of categories in which we maintain a depth of knowledge and relationships, and which we believe offer sustained performance throughout all economic cycles. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to execute the Growth Strategies, Operating Strategies and Capitalization Strategies described below.
Growth Strategies
Central to our growth is remaining focused on acquiring or developing properties in our primary investment segments: Entertainment, Recreation and Education. We may also pursue opportunities to provide mortgage financing for these investment segments in certain situations where this structure is more advantageous than owning the underlying real estate.
Our segment focus is consistent with our strategic organizational design which is structured around building centers of knowledge and strong operating competencies in each of our primary segments. Retention and building of this knowledge depth creates a competitive advantage allowing us to more quickly identify key market trends. 
To this end, we will deliberately apply information and our ingenuity to identify properties which represent potential logical extensions within each of our segments, or potential future investment segments. As part of our strategic planning and portfolio management process we assess new opportunities against the following five key underwriting principles: 
6

Inflection Opportunity

• | Specialty versus commodity real estate


• | New or emerging generation of real estate as a result of age, technology or change in consumer lifestyle or habits

Enduring Value

• | Underlying activity long-lived


• | Real estate that supports commercially successful activities


• | Outlook for business stable or growing

Excellent Execution

• | Best-of-class executions that create market-dominant properties


• | Sustainable customer demand within the category despite a potential change in tenancy


• | Tenants with a reliable track record of customer service and satisfaction

Attractive Economics

• | Initially accretive with escalating yield over time


• | Rent participation features which allow for participation in financial performance


• | Scalable depth of opportunity


• | Strong, stable rent coverage and the potential for cross-default features

Advantageous Position

• | First mover advantage and/or dominant player in real estate ownership or financing


• | Preferred tenant or borrower relationship that provides access to sites and development projects


• | Data available to assess and monitor performance

Operating Strategies
Lease Risk Minimization
To avoid initial lease-up risks and produce a predictable income stream, we typically acquire or develop single-tenant properties that are leased under long-term leases. We believe our willingness to make long-term investments in properties offers our tenants financial flexibility and allows tenants to allocate capital to their core businesses. Although we will continue to emphasize single-tenant properties, we have acquired or developed, and may continue to acquire or develop, multi-tenant properties we believe add shareholder value.
Lease Structure
We have structured our leasing arrangements to achieve a positive spread between our cost of capital and the rents paid by our tenants. We typically structure leases on a triple-net basis under which the tenants bear the principal portion of the financial and operational responsibility for the properties. During each lease term and any renewal periods, the leases typically provide for periodic increases in rent and/or percentage rent based upon a percentage of the tenant’s gross sales over a pre-determined level. In our multi-tenant property leases and some of our theatre leases, we generally require the tenant to pay a common area maintenance (“CAM”) charge to defray its pro rata share of insurance, taxes and maintenance costs.
Mortgage Structure
We have structured our mortgages to achieve economics similar to our triple-net lease structure with a positive spread between our cost of capital and the interest paid by our tenants. During each mortgage term and any renewal periods, the notes typically provide for periodic increases in interest and/or participating features based upon a percentage of the tenant’s gross sales over a pre-determined level.
Traditional REIT Lodging Structure
We may from time to time use traditional REIT lodging structures, where we hold qualified lodging facilities under the REIT and we separately hold the operations of the facilities in TRSs which are facilitated by management agreements 
7

with eligible independent contractors. However, we do not currently anticipate that these investments will exceed 10% of our total assets.
Development and Redevelopment
We intend to continue developing properties and redeveloping existing properties that are consistent with our growth strategies. We generally do not begin development of a single-tenant property without a signed lease providing for rental payments that are commensurate with our level of capital investment. In the case of a multi-tenant development, we generally require a significant amount of the development to be pre-leased prior to construction to minimize lease-up risks. In addition, to minimize overhead costs and to provide the greatest amount of flexibility, we generally outsource construction management to third-party firms. 
We believe our build-to-suit development program is a competitive advantage. First, we believe our strong relationships with our tenants and developers drive new investment opportunities that are often exclusive to us, rather than bid broadly, and with our deep knowledge of their businesses, we believe we are a value-added partner in the underwriting of each new investment. Second, we offer financing from start to finish for a build-to-suit project such that there is no need for a tenant to seek separate construction and permanent financing, which we believe makes us a more attractive partner. Third, we are actively developing strong relationships with tenants in our select segments leading to multiple investments without strict investment portfolio allocations. Finally, multiple investments with the same tenant allows us in most cases to include cross-default provisions in our lease or financing contracts, meaning a default in an obligation to us at one location is a default under all obligations with that tenant. 
We will also investigate opportunities to redevelop certain of our existing properties. We may redevelop properties in conjunction with a lease renewal or new tenant, or we may redevelop properties that have more earnings potential due to the redevelopment. Additionally, certain of our properties have excess land where we will proactively seek opportunities to further develop. 
Tenant and Customer Relationships
We intend to continue developing and maintaining long-term working relationships with entertainment, recreation, education and other specialty business operators and developers by providing capital for multiple properties on a regional, national and international basis, thereby creating efficiency and value for both the operators and the Company.
Portfolio Diversification
We will endeavor to further diversify our asset base by property type, geographic location and tenant or customer. In pursuing this diversification strategy, we will target entertainment, recreation, education and other specialty business operators that we view as leaders in their market segments and have the ability to compete effectively and perform under their agreements with the Company.
Dispositions
We will consider property dispositions for reasons such as creating price awareness of a certain property type, opportunistically taking advantage of an above-market offer or reducing exposure related to a certain tenant, property type or geographic area.
Capitalization Strategies
Debt and Equity Financing
Our ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure (see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for definitions and reconciliations), is our primary measure to evaluate our capital structure and the magnitude of our debt against our operating performance. Additionally, we utilize our ratio of net debt to gross assets as a secondary measure to evaluate our capital structure. We expect to maintain our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio between 4.6x to 5.6x. See Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a further discussion of this ratio.
We rely primarily on an unsecured debt structure. In the future, while we may obtain secured debt from time to time or assume secured debt financing obligations in acquisitions, we intend to issue primarily unsecured debt securities to 
8

satisfy our debt financing needs. We believe this strategy increases our access to capital and permits us to more efficiently match available debt and equity financing to our ongoing capital requirements.
Our sources of equity financing consist of the issuance of common shares as well as the issuance of preferred shares (including convertible preferred shares). In addition to larger underwritten registered public offerings of both common and preferred shares, we have also offered shares pursuant to registered public offerings through the direct share purchase component of our Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Share Purchase Plan (“DSP Plan”). While such offerings are generally smaller than a typical underwritten public offering, issuing common shares under the direct share purchase component of our DSP Plan allows us to access capital on a more frequent basis in a cost-effective manner. We expect to opportunistically access the equity markets in the future and, depending primarily on the size and timing of our equity capital needs, may continue to issue shares under the direct share purchase component of our DSP Plan. Furthermore, we may issue shares in connection with acquisitions in the future. 

Joint Ventures
We will examine and may pursue potential additional joint venture opportunities with institutional investors or developers if the investments to which they relate meet our guiding principles discussed above. We may employ higher leverage in joint ventures.
Payment of Regular Dividends
We pay dividend distributions to our common shareholders on a monthly basis (as opposed to a quarterly basis). We expect to continue to pay dividend distributions to our preferred shareholders on a quarterly basis. Our Series C cumulative convertible preferred shares (“Series C preferred shares”) have a dividend rate of 5.75%, our Series E cumulative convertible preferred shares (“Series E preferred shares”) have a dividend rate of 9.00% and our Series G cumulative redeemable preferred shares ("Series G preferred shares") have a dividend rate of 5.75%. Among the factors the Company’s board of trustees (“Board of Trustees”) considers in setting the common share dividend rate are the applicable REIT tax rules and regulations that apply to dividends, the Company’s results of operations, including FFO and FFOAA per share, and the Company’s Cash Available for Distribution (defined as net cash flow available for distribution after payment of operating expenses, debt service, preferred dividends and other obligations).
Competition
We compete for real estate financing opportunities with other companies that invest in real estate, as well as traditional financial sources such as banks and insurance companies. REITs have financed, and may continue to seek to finance, entertainment, recreation, education and other specialty properties as new properties are developed or become available for acquisition.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 64 full-time employees.
Principal Executive Offices
The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 909 Walnut Street, Suite 200, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; telephone (816) 472-1700.
