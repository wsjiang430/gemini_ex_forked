Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Inspired Builders, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, was previously located in Boston, Massachusetts. On January 13, 2012, pursuant to the change of control transaction, we relocated to Santa Monica, California. Until the change of control transaction, we focused on repairing and providing home improvements for the homeowners. Until August 15, 2017 the Company was focused on acquiring, investing in, developing and managing real estate properties and related investments. On August 15, 2017, pursuant to another change in control transaction, we relocated to Miami, Florida and ceased all operations as a real estate company.
 
Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We are a shell company which is moving forward with the business of identifying and entering into a business combination with a privately held business or company, domiciled and operating in an emerging market that is seeking the advantages of being a publicly held corporation whose stock is traded on the OTC market place. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.
 
We may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.
 
In the next 12 months if we are unable to satisfy our cash requirements, our major shareholder has indicated that they are willing to loan additional funds to the Company to cover any shortfalls, although there is no written agreement or guarantee.
 
We plan to raise funds through equity financing in the next 12 months. If we successfully raise the funds, it will be used for our operations and to invest in potential joint venture or acquisition.
