ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Workday is a leading provider of enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources. Founded in 2005, Workday delivers financial management, human capital management, planning, and analytics applications designed for the world’s largest companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. Organizations ranging from medium-sized businesses to Fortune 50 enterprises have selected Workday. We achieved this leadership position through our innovative and adaptable technology, and commitment to customer satisfaction.
Organizations today operate in environments that are highly complex and changing at an increasing rate. Managers and employees must quickly synthesize vast amounts of information and react to rapid changes in global business and regulatory environments. To be successful, they need highly functional and flexible software that enables informed decision-making about the enterprise-wide allocation of their resources. Additionally, managers and employees expect to interact with enterprise systems in an open, intuitive, and collaborative way, including real-time access through a wide range of mobile and computing devices. 
Workday is leading the way in helping organizations better manage their financial and human capital resources. As part of our applications, we provide embedded analytics that capture the content and context of everyday business events, facilitating fast and informed decision-making from wherever users are working. In addition, we provide an intuitive user experience similar to those of leading consumer internet sites, reducing the time for training on our applications.
Since Workday is delivered in the cloud, organizations can embrace change in their operating environments with support for new regulatory requirements, increased performance, and enhancement of the user experience that we deliver through our rapid innovation cycle of frequent functionality-rich feature releases. We deliver continuous innovation with major feature releases delivered two times per year, in addition to weekly updates where smaller sets of features are delivered to customers with minimal downtime disruption. When the new feature releases are delivered, the prior version is fully replaced. As a result, all Workday customers are on the same version at all times. Feature releases are not subject to an additional fee. Workday customers benefit from the most current technologies without the burden of large upgrade costs typically associated with traditional on-premise software.

We deliver our cloud applications using an innovative technology foundation that leverages the most recent advances in cloud computing and data management and allows us to deliver applications that are highly functional, flexible, and fast. Our use of a multi-tenant architecture in which customers are on the same version of our software enables innovations to be deployed quickly. In addition, we use objects to represent real-world entities such as employees, benefits, budgets, charts of accounts, and organizations, combining business logic and data in one place and creating actionable analytics that are part of our core transactional systems of record. Our use of in memory data management allows rapid and efficient delivery of embedded business intelligence. Workday leverages machine learning in our applications to help customers make smarter financial and workforce decisions. We also provide open, standards-based web-services application programming interfaces and pre-built packaged integrations and connectors. This approach substantially reduces the need for our customers to buy and support a broad range of IT infrastructure, significantly reducing costs and complexity.

Customers
Our diverse customer base includes medium-sized and large, global companies, as well as smaller organizations that primarily use our planning product. Our customers span numerous industry categories, including technology, financial services, business and professional services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing, retail and hospitality, education, government, and non-profit. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our revenues during fiscal 2019.
We have built a company culture centered around our customers’ success and satisfaction. We have developed several programs designed to provide customers with service options to enhance their experience with our applications. These services include 24x7 support; a professional services ecosystem that consists of our Workday consulting teams and system integrators that are trained on our applications; a Customer Success Management group to assist customers in production; and an online community to facilitate collaboration among customers and with the Workday product development teams.
Employees
As of January 31, 2019, we had approximately 10,500 employees. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good.
Backlog
Backlog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations, represents our total contractual commitments for which services will be performed. Backlog generally increases with bookings and generally converts into revenue as contractual commitments are fulfilled. For further information, see Note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Sales and Marketing
We sell Workday subscription services primarily through our direct sales organization, which is comprised of field sales and field sales support personnel. Workday’s field sales team is aligned by geography, industry, and/or prospect size.
We generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities, and build brand awareness through our marketing programs and through our strategic relationships. Our marketing programs target senior business leaders, including finance, human resources, and IT executives.
As a core part of our strategy, we have developed an ecosystem of partners to both broaden and complement our application offerings and to provide services that are outside of Workday’s areas of focus. These relationships include software and technology partners, consulting and implementation service providers, and business process outsourcing partners, which enable Workday to address the finance and human resources-related challenges our customers face while maintaining focus on executing against our strategy.
Product Development
Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to product development and our ability to rapidly introduce new products, technologies, features, and functionality. Our product development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing, and certification of our products. We focus our efforts on developing new products and core technologies as well as further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance, and flexibility of existing products.

Competition
The overall market for enterprise application software is rapidly evolving, highly competitive, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new products. We currently compete with large, well-established, enterprise application software vendors, such as SAP SE (“SAP”) and Oracle Corporation (“Oracle”). SAP and Oracle are established enterprise software companies that have greater name recognition, much longer operating histories, and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and other resources than we have and are able to provide a broader scope of business applications than our current suite of applications. We also face competition from other enterprise software vendors and from vendors of specific applications, some of which offer cloud-based solutions. These vendors include The Ultimate Software Group, Inc., Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Infor, Inc., Ceridian HCM Holding Inc., Microsoft Corporation, and Anaplan, Inc. We may also face competition from a variety of vendors of cloud-based and on-premise software applications that address only one or a portion of our applications. In addition, other cloud companies that provide services in different markets may develop solutions in our target markets, and some potential customers may elect to develop their own internal solutions. However, the domain expertise that is required for a successful solution in the areas of financial management, HCM, and analytics may inhibit new entrants that are unable to invest the necessary capital to accurately reflect global requirements and regulations. We expect continued consolidation in our industry that could lead to significantly increased competition.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:

• | level of customer satisfaction;


• | ease of deployment and use of applications;


• | breadth and depth of application functionality;


• | total cost of ownership;


• | brand awareness and reputation;


• | adaptive technology platform;


• | capability for configuration, integration, security, scalability, and reliability of applications;


• | operational excellence to ensure system availability, scalability, and performance;


• | ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;


• | domain expertise on financial, human resources, and payroll regulations;


• | size of customer base and level of user adoption;


• | customer confidence in financial stability and future viability; and


• | ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications.

We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance in the areas of product development and customer support.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We require our employees, contractors, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements, and we control access to software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections and controls to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new products, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our applications are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult.
We expect that software and other applications in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties may make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
