 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview 
 We are one of the world’s leading franchisors in the real estate industry, franchising real estate brokerages globally under the RE/MAX brand (“RE/MAX”) and mortgage brokerages within the U.S. under the Motto Mortgage brand (“Motto”). RE/MAX and Motto are 100% franchised—we do not own any of the brokerages that operate under these brands. We focus on enabling our franchisees’ success by providing quality education and training, powerful technology tools and support and valuable marketing to build the strength of the RE/MAX and Motto brands. Although we partner with our franchisees to assist them in growing their brokerages, they fund the cost of developing their brokerages.  As a result, we maintain a low fixed-cost structure which, combined with our recurring fee-based models, enables us to capitalize on the economic benefits of the franchising model, yielding high margins and significant cash flow.
 Our History. RE/MAX was founded in 1973 with an innovative, entrepreneurial culture affording our franchisees and their agents the flexibility to operate their businesses with great independence. In the early years of our expansion in the U.S. and Canada, we accelerated the brand’s growth by selling regional franchise rights to independent owners for certain geographic regions, a practice we still employ in countries outside of the U.S. and Canada. RE/MAX has held the number one market share in the U.S. and Canada combined since 1999, as measured by total residential transaction sides completed by our agents. On June 25, 2013, RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. (“RE/MAX Holdings”) was formed as a Delaware corporation, and shares of our Class A common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “RMAX” on October 2, 2013. On October 7, 2013, RE/MAX Holdings completed an initial public offering of its shares of Class A common stock. In October 2016, we launched Motto, the first national mortgage brokerage franchise offering in the United States. On February 26, 2018, we acquired Active Website, LLC, (“booj”), a real estate technology company, in order to deliver core technology solutions designed for and with RE/MAX affiliates. 
 Our Brands. RE/MAX. The RE/MAX strategy is to sell franchises to real estate brokers and help those franchisees recruit and retain the best agents. The RE/MAX brand is built on the strength of our global franchise network, which is designed to attract and retain the best-performing and most experienced agents by maximizing their opportunity to retain a larger portion of their commissions. As a result of our unique agent-centric approach, we have established a nearly 50-year track record of helping millions of homebuyers and sellers achieve their goals, creating several competitive advantages in the process:

· | Leading agent productivity. We believe that RE/MAX agents are substantially more productive than the industry average. In fact, RE/MAX agents at large brokerages on average outsell competing agents more than two-to-one based on a survey of the largest participating U.S. brokerages per the 2018 REAL Trends 500.

· | Leading market share. Nobody in the world sells more real estate than RE/MAX, as measured by residential transaction sides.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leading brand awareness. The RE/MAX brand has the highest level of unaided brand awareness in real estate in the U.S. and Canada according to a consumer study conducted by MMR Strategy Group, and our iconic red, white and blue RE/MAX hot air balloon is one of the most recognized real estate logos in the world.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leading global presence. We have a growing global presence and our agent count outside the U.S. and Canada continues to increase. Today, the RE/MAX brand has over 120,000 agents operating in over 8,000 offices, and a presence in more than 110 countries and territories—a global footprint bigger than any other real estate brokerage brand in the world.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The majority of RE/MAX revenue—67% in 2018—is derived from fixed, contractual fees and dues paid to us based on the number of agents in our franchise network, so agent count, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, is a key measure of our business performance. 

124,280 Agents | 8,229 Offices | 118 Countries and Territories

  As of December 31, 2018. 
 Motto Mortgage. The Motto Mortgage brokerage model offers U.S. real estate brokers access to the mortgage brokerage business, which is highly complementary to our real estate business, and is designed to help Motto franchise owners comply with all applicable mortgage regulations. Motto franchisees offer potential homebuyers an opportunity to find both real estate agents and independent Motto loan originators at offices near each other. Further, Motto loan originators provide homebuyers with financing choices by providing access to a variety of quality loan options from multiple leading wholesale lenders.  In addition, Motto provides powerful technology to its franchisees that simplifies the mortgage process. Motto franchisees are mortgage brokers and not mortgage bankers. Likewise, we franchise the Motto system and are not lenders or brokers. 
 Motto’s revenue model consists of fixed, contractual fees paid monthly on a per-office basis by the broker for being a part of the Motto network and for use of the Motto brand, and from sales of individual franchises. We are not compensated based on the volume of loans completed by a franchise. We believe it will generally take 14 to 17 months after the sale of a Motto franchise for a franchisee to ramp up to paying a full set of monthly fees. Approximately 80 Motto franchises were operational as of December 31, 2018. We remain focused on enabling the success of these initial franchises, which we believe will serve as concept validators. Motto franchisees should profit by attracting and retaining professional, highly productive loan originators who provide superior client service and value.
 Industry Overview and Trends
 We are a franchisor of businesses in two facets of the real estate industry—real estate brokerages and mortgage brokerages. With approximately 95% of our revenue and nearly three-quarters of our RE/MAX agent count coming from 

 
  6

 

our franchising operations in the U.S. and Canada, we are significantly affected by the real estate market in the U.S. and Canada.
 The U.S. and Canadian Real Estate Industry are Large Markets. The U.S. residential real estate industry is an approximately $1.83 trillion market based on 2018 sales volume, according to U.S. Census Bureau data and existing home sales information from the National Association of Realtors (“NAR”). Canadian home sales totaled approximately CA$222 billion in 2018, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association (“CREA”).
 How Brokerages Make Money. Residential real estate brokerages typically realize revenue by charging a commission based on a percentage of the price of the home sold and/or by charging their agents, who are independent contractors, fees for services rendered. The real estate brokerage industry generally benefits in periods of rising home prices and transaction activity (with the number of licensed real estate agents generally increasing during such periods) and is typically adversely impacted in periods of falling prices and home sale transactions (with the number of licensed real estate agents generally decreasing during such periods).
 Residential mortgage brokerages typically realize revenue by charging fees for their service, which is based on a percentage of the mortgage loan amount. The mortgage brokerage industry generally benefits from periods of increasing home sales activity, as this generally results in increased purchase-money mortgage originations (loans that arise during the initial sale of a house), and periods when homeowners refinance to take advantage of lower interest rates. The mortgage brokerage industry is usually adversely impacted in periods of decreasing home sales activity, as this results in less purchase-money mortgage originations, and periods of less favorable interest rates making homeowners less likely to refinance.
 The Residential Real Estate Industry is Cyclical in Nature. The residential real estate industry is cyclical in nature but has shown strong long-term growth. As illustrated below, the number of existing home sales transactions in the U.S. and Canada has generally increased during periods of economic growth:

 Canadian Existing Home Sales

 U.S. Housing Trends. After a decade of expansion following the onset of the Great Recession, the U.S. housing market slowed during the latter part of 2018, particularly in the West. For all of 2018, total existing home sales decreased 3.1 percent, the first annual decline since 2014 according to NAR. Persistent price appreciation, low housing inventory, rising interest rates, and weak wage growth were among the more meaningful contributors to the slowdown in home sales as homebuyers and sellers adapted to a shifting market.  In January 2019, NAR’s forecast called for stabilizing existing home sales in 2019.
 As we entered 2019, the reduction in home sales transactions began to lead to increasing inventory and slowing price appreciation while mortgage rates leveled off after rising during the second half of 2018. The housing market, which has generally favored sellers over the past several years, began to shift more toward greater equilibrium which we believe will be healthy for housing over the longer term.
 Additionally, household formation growth has increased demand for housing and this dynamic looks favorable for the future as discussed in more detail below. However, challenges to the housing market remain. According to the 2018 Nation’s Housing Report compiled by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University (the “Report”), supplies of single-family homes for sale remain relatively scarce, particularly at the lower-cost end of the spectrum. While it is not entirely understood why supplies are so low, the conversion of 3.9 million single-family homes to rental properties between 2006 and 2016, the ongoing decline in residential mobility rates and the low level of single-family construction are likely contributors according to the Report. Additionally, while affordability pressures have eased, the Report notes this issue remains widespread, a long-term trend for which the country has not solved.
 Favorable Long-Term Demand. We believe long-term demand for housing in the U.S. is driven by many factors including the economic health of the domestic economy, demographic trends, affordability, interest rates and local factors such as demand relative to supply. We also believe the residential real estate market in the U.S. will benefit from fundamental demographic shifts over the long term, including:

· | An increase in demand from rising household formations, including as a result of immigration, population growth and wealth accumulation and wage growth of minorities. According to the Report, U.S. household formations are projected to reach 12.0 million between 2017 and 2027. Although this projection is down from 2016’s projection of 13.6 million, it is more in line with increases seen over the past few years. Likewise, the U.S. Census Bureau projects that the U.S. will continue to experience long-term population growth and predicts net immigration of 30 million individuals from 2014 to 2050.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An increase in demand from generational shifts. We believe there is pent-up selling demand from generational shifts, such as many retirement age homeowners, from the “baby boom” generation, who are likely to take advantage of improved housing market conditions in order to sell their existing residences and retire in new areas of the country or purchase smaller homes. Similarly, we also believe there is pent-up buying demand among adults in the millennial generation, currently the nation’s largest living generation. The millennial generation is moving into their prime home-buying years as they form households and are supported by strong employment, relatively low interest rates, and rising consumer confidence.

 Notable Broker and Agent Trends. Notable trends impacting residential real estate brokers and agents include:

· | Almost 90% of all U.S. homebuyers and sellers use an agent – About 91% of sellers and 87% of purchasers were represented by a real estate agent in 2018, according to NAR data. These figures have climbed over the last decade and a half—a period of time during which technology has materially changed the typical home-buying or -selling transaction:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Percentage of Home Buyers and Sellers Using an Agent
    
 Source: NAR Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers 

· | The number of agents entering the industry is increasing – NAR membership continued to grow during 2018 and was approaching its all-time record of 1.37 million members established in 2006. However, the pace of growth slowed and it remains to be seen what impact the decline in existing home sales toward the end of 2018 will have on NAR membership. Typically, during periods of expansion in the housing cycle, the numbers of agents entering the industry increase as the barriers to entry are relatively low. Many of the recent entrants are new to the profession. In fact, NAR reported in 2018 that 22% of its members had been licensed less than one year, a quadrupling of the percentage from just five years ago. In contrast, our U.S. agent count remained essentially flat in 2018. It is not uncommon for our U.S. agent growth rate to lag that of NAR. At RE/MAX, our model is not for everyone. We focus our brokers on the importance of attracting and retaining highly productive agents and those who aspire to learn and produce more.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Competition for agents and listings remains fierce – Competition for agents, especially highly productive agents, and listings has always been fierce and today is no different. Franchisors and brokers are continually refining and fine-tuning their economic models in order to craft what they believe to be the most compelling value proposition in order to attract and retain the most productive agents and to capture consumer listings. The year 2018 remained heated in this regard as the industry witnessed the continuation of significant capital invested in relatively new entrants to our industry, resulting in many well-financed competitors offering a wide variety of business models. See Competition for additional discussion. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The importance of technology continues to increase – We believe industry market participants will continue to focus on technology investments as evidenced by increased capital flowing into the industry. We believe mobile platforms, artificial intelligence and predictive analytics are increasingly becoming a point of focus as the industry looks to use technological advancements to simplify and streamline the oftentimes complicated process of buying and selling a home. In response, many established brokers are favoring proprietary technology as opposed to purchasing it from third parties.

  Canadian Housing Trends. The housing market in Canada generally stabilized in 2018, after unprecedented increases in average sales prices in 2017. We expect the market to continue to stabilize in 2019 with only modest price increases and as Canadians react to higher interest rates, stricter qualification requirements and economic conditions. According to the 2019 RE/MAX Housing Market Outlook Report, 36% of Canadians are considering buying a property in the next five years, down from 48% from 2018. The decrease is attributed to both the actual and perceived impact of the mortgage stress test and rising interest rates on housing affordability.
 The year 2018 continued to see the single-family detached home and condo markets diverge in Canada’s two highest-

 
  9

 

priced real estate markets, Greater Vancouver and the Greater Toronto area. The mix of relative affordability for condo units and price appreciation for detached homes in recent years, combined with government policy changes in both markets has helped push an influx of buyers toward condo ownership. The Greater Vancouver condo market experienced reduced foreign buyer activity which opened more opportunity for local buyers; while the number of sales in the residential properties market dropped by 30% with the average home price only increasing approximately 2%. In the Greater Toronto area, the lack of affordability in the single-detached segment made it difficult for entry level buyers to enter the market and, as a result, the relatively affordable condo market now represents approximately 37% of total residential transactions in the Greater Toronto market.  
 In order to find a balance between desirable home features and affordability, many buyers are continuing to look at real estate markets outside of the country’s largest urban centers. CREA projects the average residential sale price for Canada will increase 1.7% in 2019, which indicates that the desire for home ownership remains strong, particularly among Canadian millennials.  
 The Long-Term Value Proposition for Real Estate Brokerage Services. We believe the traditional agent-assisted business model compares favorably to alternative channels of the residential brokerage industry, such as discount brokers, “for sale by owner” listings, and lower-fee brokerages catering to consumers who use technology for some of the services traditionally provided by brokers, because full-service brokerages are best suited to address many of the key characteristics of real estate transactions, including: 

(i) | the complexity and large monetary value involved in home sale transactions,
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | the infrequency of home sale transactions,
-----+-------------------------------------------


(iii) | the high price variability in the home market,
------+-----------------------------------------------


(iv) | the intimate local knowledge necessary to advise clients on neighborhood characteristics,
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(v) | the unique nature of each particular home, and
----+-----------------------------------------------


(vi) | the consumer’s need for a high degree of personalized advice and support in light of these factors.
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  For these reasons, we believe that consumers will continue to use the agent-assisted model for residential real estate transactions. In addition, although listings are available for viewing on a wide variety of real estate websites, we believe an agent’s local market expertise provides the ability to better understand the inventory of for-sale homes and the interests of potential buyers. This knowledge allows the agent to customize the pool of potential homes they show to a buyer, as well as help sellers to present their home professionally to best attract potential buyers. 
 The Long-Term Value Proposition for Mortgage Brokerage Services. Likewise, we believe mortgage brokers provide a valuable “concierge” service for consumers. Mortgage brokers are familiar with the latest loan programs and choices available through various wholesale lenders. A professional mortgage broker can introduce consumers to loan programs from several lenders, providing choice and information consumers may be unlikely to locate on their own. In 2017, the percentage of mortgage originations handled by mortgage brokerages was substantially below average historical levels, which we believed showed potential for growth in the mortgage brokerage production channel. In 2018, we began to realize that potential as the percentage of mortgage originations handled by mortgage brokerages became more in line with our expectations and historical averages. We believe there is room for additional growth as the percentage of mortgage originations handled by mortgage brokerages in 2018 has still not reached maximum levels we have seen in the past. 
 Purchase-money mortgage originations correlate to the overall number of home sales and home prices. Home purchases are driven primarily by the buyer’s personal and professional circumstances, whereas refinances depend mainly upon interest rates.

 
  10

 


 According to Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (known as “Freddie Mac”), purchase-money originations are expected to increase gradually in the next few years. As compared to competitors, Motto has a significantly higher ratio of purchase-money mortgage originations to refinances. We believe that the expected increase in purchase-money originations will provide a growth opportunity for a Motto franchise.

 Our Franchise Model and Offering 
 Introduction to Franchising. Franchising is a distributed model for licensing the use of the franchisor’s system and brand. In return, the franchisee retains ownership and sole responsibility for the local business, and therefore the substantial portion of the profits it generates and its risks. The successful franchisor provides its franchisees: i) a unique product or service offering; ii) a distinctive brand name, and as the system gains market share, the favorable consumer recognition that brand comes to symbolize; iii) training, productivity tools and technology to help franchisees operate their business effectively, efficiently and successfully and iv) group purchasing power of the franchise system to obtain favorable prices for supplies, advertising, and other tools and services necessary in the operation of the business. Because franchising involves principally the development and licensing of intellectual property, and the costs of retail space and employees are borne by the individual unit owner, it is a low fixed-cost structure typified by high gross margins, allowing the franchisor to focus on innovation, franchisee training and support, and marketing to grow brand reputation. 

The RE/MAX “Agent-Centric” Franchise Offering. We believe that our “agent-centric” approach is a compelling offering in the real estate brokerage industry, and it enables us to attract and retain highly effective agents and motivated franchisees to our network and drive growth in our business and profitability. Our model provides the following combination of benefits to our franchisees and agents:

· | High Agent Commission Fee Split and Low Franchise Fees. The RE/MAX high commission split concept is a cornerstone of our model and, although not unique, differentiates us in the industry. That differentiation is most evident when our brand advantages and services are factored in as part of the concept. We recommend to our franchisees an agent-favorable commission split of 95%/5%, in exchange for the agent paying fixed fees to share the overhead and other costs of the brokerage. This model allows high-producing agents to earn a higher commission compared to traditional brokerages where the broker typically takes 30% to 40% of the agent’s commission, and it provides brokers with the resources to offer key services and support to their agents.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Affiliation with the Best Brand in Residential Real Estate. With number one market share in the U.S. and Canada combined as measured by total residential transaction sides completed by RE/MAX agents, and leading unaided brand awareness in the U.S. and Canada, according to a consumer study by MMR Strategy Group, we reinforce brand awareness through marketing and advertising campaigns that are supported by our franchisees’ and agents’ local marketing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Entrepreneurial, High-Performance Culture. Our brand and the economics of our model generally attract driven, professional, highly productive franchisees, and we allow them autonomy to run their businesses independently, including, generally, the freedom to set commission rates and oversee local advertising.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sophisticated Technology, including High Traffic Websites Supporting Lead Referral Systems. Remax.com was the most visited real estate franchisor website during 2018, according to Hitwise data. When a prospective buyer inquires about a property displayed on our websites, a RE/MAX agent receives this lead through our lead referral system, LeadStreet®, without a referral fee. We believe that no other national real estate brand provides

their agents comparable access to free leads. In addition, we believe the upcoming booj platform will provide additional powerful technology that will further enhance our franchise offering and enable us to attract and retain highly productive agents.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | RE/MAX University® Training Programs. RE/MAX University® offers on-demand access to industry information and advanced training in areas such as distressed properties, luxury properties, senior clients, buyer agency and many other specialty areas of real estate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | RE/MAX Approved Supplier Program. Using the collective buying power of our franchise network, a network of preferred suppliers provide group discount prices, marketing materials that have been pre-vetted to comply with RE/MAX brand standards and higher quality materials that may not be cost-effective to procure on an individual office basis. These vendors provide us additional revenue in return for marketing access to our network of franchisees and agents.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We attribute our success to our ability, by providing this unique, agent-centric suite of benefits, to recruit and retain motivated franchisees and their highly productive agents. Our goal is to continue a self-reinforcing cycle that we call “Premier Market Presence,” whereby recruiting agents and franchisees helps achieve a network effect to further enhance our brand and market share, expand our franchise network and support offerings, and ultimately grow our revenue, as illustrated below:

 RE/MAX Four-Tier Franchise Structure. RE/MAX is a 100% franchised business, with all of the RE/MAX branded brokerage office locations being operated by franchisees. We franchise directly in the U.S. and Canada, in what we call “Company-owned Regions.” Brokerage offices, in turn, enter into independent contractor relationships with real estate sales agents who represent real estate buyers and sellers. In the early years of our expansion in the U.S. and Canada, we sold regional franchise rights to independent owners for certain geographic regions (“Independent Regions”), pursuant to which those Independent Regions have the exclusive right to sell franchises in those regions.  In recent years, we have pursued a strategy to acquire those regional franchise rights from Independent Regions in the U.S. and Canada.

 RE/MAX Marketing and Promotion. We believe the widespread recognition of the RE/MAX brand and our iconic red, white and blue RE/MAX hot air balloon logo and property signs is a key aspect of our value proposition to agents and franchisees. A variety of advertising, marketing and promotion programs build our brand and generate leads for our agents, including leading websites such as remax.com, advertising campaigns using television, digital marketing, social media, print, billboards and signs, and appearances of the well-known RE/MAX hot air balloon.
 Event-based marketing programs, sponsorships, sporting activities and other similar functions also promote our brand. These include our support, since 1992 for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals in the U.S. and Children's Miracle Network in Canada, to help sick and injured children. Through the Miracle Home program, participating RE/MAX agents donate to Children's Miracle Network Hospitals once a home sale transaction is complete. 
 Our franchisees and their agents fund nearly all of the advertising, marketing and promotion supporting the RE/MAX brand, which, in the U.S. and Canada, occurs primarily on two levels: 

· | Local Campaigns. Our franchisees and agents engage in extensive promotional efforts within their local markets to attract customers and drive agent and brand awareness locally. These programs are subject to our brand guidelines and quality standards for use of the RE/MAX brand, but we allow our franchisees and agents substantial flexibility to create advertising, marketing and promotion programs that are tailored to local market conditions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Regional and Pan-Regional Marketing Campaigns. Funds are collected from franchisees by regional advertising fund entities in Company-owned Regions to support both regional and pan-regional marketing campaigns to build brand awareness and to support the Company’s agent and broker technology. The use of the fund balances is restricted by the terms of our franchise agreements. Independent Regions may contribute to national or pan-regional creative and/or media campaigns to achieve economies of scale in the purchase of advertising but are generally responsible for any regional advertising in their respective areas.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    Prior to January 1, 2019, the advertising fund entities in Company-owned Regions were owned by our founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors, David Liniger, and therefore, this advertising activity is excluded from our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2019, the Company acquired these entities, which were then merged, except for Western Canada, into a new entity called RE/MAX Marketing Fund (with Western Canada, collectively, the “Marketing Funds”). As in the past, we are contractually obligated to use the funds collected to support regional and pan-regional marketing campaigns to build brand awareness and to support our agent and broker technology. Beginning January 1, 2019, the assets and liabilities of the Marketing Funds will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. We will also begin recognizing revenue from the amounts collected, which substantially increases our revenues. However, because these funds are contractually encumbered for the benefit of franchisees and their agents, we expect to have equal and offsetting expenses such that there is no material impact to overall profitability as a result of this acquisition. See Note 19, Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
 The Motto Mortgage Brokerage Model. Through our Motto business, we are a mortgage brokerage franchisor, not a lender or mortgage broker. Our franchisees are brokers, not lenders, and so neither we nor our franchisees fund any loans. As a franchisor, we help our Motto franchisees establish independent mortgage brokerage companies, with a model designed to comply with all applicable regulations. The technology, training, marketing, tools and other services that we provide to Motto franchisees have been designed to enable real estate brokers—both RE/MAX franchisees and other entrepreneurs—to overcome the barriers to enter the mortgage business. When a Motto franchise is in close physical proximity to a real estate brokerage, homebuyers can enjoy an enhanced, coordinated, convenient and simplified experience with a professional real estate agent to find a home and with a Motto loan originator to secure financing from among several quality financing options. Because Motto’s value proposition is based in part on proximity to real estate brokerages and marketing to home-buying customers, we believe our franchisees are well-positioned to benefit from the anticipated gradual increase in purchase-money mortgage origination market. We believe this convenience should be a differentiator for real estate agents, which we believe will result in enhanced customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, which is essential for a successful real estate agent. There are not presently any other national mortgage brokerage franchisors in the United States.

 Our Motto Mortgage brokerage franchise business, Motto Franchising, LLC, offers seven-year agreements with franchisees. Motto sells franchises directly throughout the U.S. as there are no regional franchise rights in the Motto system.  Motto Franchising, LLC provides an out-of-the-box franchise model—complete with training, support and   technology configuration and implementation that is customized for each office—which allows franchisees to get up and running quickly.  Loan originators at Motto franchises are employees of the franchisee and not independent contractors.
 Financial Model 
 As a franchisor, we maintain a low fixed-cost structure. In addition, our stable, fee-based model derives a majority of our revenue from recurring fees paid by our RE/MAX and Motto franchisees, RE/MAX Independent Region franchise owners and RE/MAX agents. This combination helps us drive significant operating leverage through incremental revenue growth, yielding healthy margins and significant cash flow.

 Revenue Streams. The chart below illustrates our revenue streams: 
 Revenue Streams as Percentage of 2018 Total Revenue 

         The amount of the various RE/MAX fee types will vary significantly depending on whether coming from Company-owned regions, Independent Regions, or global regions, with the greatest amounts in Company-owned regions.  See discussion of revenue per agent below.
 Continuing Franchise Fees. Continuing franchise fees are fixed contractual fees paid monthly by regional franchise owners in Independent Regions or franchisees in Company-owned Regions to RE/MAX based on their number of agents. Likewise, Motto continuing franchise fees are fixed contractual fees paid monthly by Motto franchisees.
 Annual Dues. Annual dues are the membership fees that agents pay directly to us to be a part of the RE/MAX network and use the RE/MAX brand. Annual dues are currently a flat fee per agent paid annually. Motto franchisees do not pay annual dues.
 Broker Fees. Broker fees are assessed against real estate commissions paid by customers when a RE/MAX agent sells a home. Generally, the amount paid is 1% of the total commission on the transaction, although the percentage can vary based on the specific terms of the broker fee agreement. The amount of commission collected by brokers is based primarily on the sales volume of RE/MAX agents, home sale prices in such sales and real estate commissions earned by agents on these transactions. Broker fees, therefore, vary based upon the overall health of the real estate industry and the volume of existing home sales. Additionally, agents in Company-owned Regions existing prior to 2004, the year we began assessing broker fees, are generally “grandfathered” and continue to be exempt from paying a broker fee. As of December 31, 2018, grandfathered agents represented approximately 20% of total agents in U.S. Company-owned regions. We expect that over time, exempt agents will be replaced by new agents who will pay broker fees, which will have a positive impact on our broker fee revenue independent of changes in agent count, sales volume and home sale prices. Motto franchisees do not pay any fees based on the number or dollar value of loans brokered.

 Franchise Sales and Other Revenue. Franchise sales and other revenue primarily consists of:

· | Franchise Sales: Revenue from sales and renewals of individual franchises in RE/MAX Company-owned Regions, Independent Regions, and Motto, as well as RE/MAX regional and country master franchises for Independent Regions in global markets outside of North America (“Global Regions”). We receive only a portion of the revenue from the sales and renewals of individual franchises from Independent and Global Regions. The franchise sale initial fees and commissions related to franchise sales are recognized over the contractual term of the franchise agreement. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other Revenue: Revenue from (a) preferred marketing arrangements and approved supplier programs with such revenue being either a flat fee or a percentage of revenue from products and services sold to RE/MAX agents), (b) event-based revenue from training and other programs, including our annual convention in the U.S., and (c) revenue from booj’s legacy business of supplying websites and other technology to independent real estate brokerages.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Revenue per Agent in Owned versus Independent RE/MAX Regions. We receive a higher amount of revenue per agent in our Company-owned Regions than in our Independent Regions in the U.S. and Canada, and more in Independent Regions in the U.S. and Canada than in Global Regions. While both Company-owned Regions and Independent Regions in the U.S. and Canada charge relatively similar fees to RE/MAX brokerages and agents, we receive the entire amount of the continuing franchise fee, broker fee and initial franchise and renewal fee in Company-owned Regions, whereas we receive only a portion of these fees in Independent Regions. We generally receive 15%, 20% or 30% of the amount of such fees in Independent Regions, which is a fixed rate in each particular Independent Region established by the terms of the applicable regional franchise agreement. We base our continuing franchise fees, agent dues and broker fees outside the U.S. and Canada on the same structure as our Independent Regions, except that the aggregate level of such fees is substantially lower in these markets. In 2018, the average annual revenue per agent was as follows: 
    
(1) | Annual dues are currently a flat fee of US$410/CA$410 per agent annually for our U.S. and Canadian agents. The average per agent for the year ended December 31, 2018 in both Independent Regions and Company-owned Regions reflects the impact of foreign currency movements related to revenue received from Canadian agents. The ratio of Canadian agents to U.S. agents in Independent Regions has increased as a result of U.S. Independent Region acquisitions.

  Value Creation and Growth Strategy 
 Our favorable margins generate healthy cash flow, which facilitates our value creation and growth strategy.  As a leading franchisor in the residential real estate industry in the U.S. and Canada, we create shareholder value by: 
a) | growing organically by building on our network of over 8,000 RE/MAX franchisees and 120,000 agents and our network of nearly 80 open Motto mortgage brokerage franchises;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b) | catalyzing growth by reacquiring regional RE/MAX franchise rights and acquiring other complementary businesses; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

c) | returning capital to shareholders.
---+-----------------------------------

  Organic Growth. Our organic growth comes from: a) RE/MAX agent count growth; b) RE/MAX and Motto franchise sales, c) increases in opportunity to monetize the value of our RE/MAX and Motto networks; d) the extent to which we increase the fees paid by RE/MAX or Motto franchisees or RE/MAX agents; and e) growth in agent productivity or higher home prices. 
    
Organic Growth from Agent Count and Franchise Sales. With respect to RE/MAX agent count growth, we experienced agent losses during the downturn, but we returned to a period of net global agent growth in 2012 and our year-over-year growth in agent count continued from 2013 through 2018.

As shown in the following table, during the second half of 2018 our agent count growth in U.S. decelerated as U.S. existing home sales decelerated, a correlation we have seen previously. This deceleration may pose future challenges to organic growth from agent count.

 RE/MAX Agent Count Year-Over-Year Growth Rate by Geography

 We have several initiatives designed to improve the value proposition offered to both franchisees and agents, which we believe will help recruiting and retention. Two key initiatives in 2019 are:
· | Technology – We have several technology initiatives, including developing technology for and by RE/MAX affiliates leveraging the booj platform, which we believe will make our highly productive agents even more efficient and successful and help RE/MAX franchisees recruit and retain agents. Leveraging booj’s existing technology stack, we are developing a custom-built, integrated platform with products that interact and evolve with one another. Included in this platform will be a customer-relationship management platform integrated with agent, office and team websites, lead cultivation tools, marketing resources, social integration and more. We will also leverage the capabilities of other strategic partners as we develop advanced technology solutions for the RE/MAX network. We have focused on enhancing and investing in the technology supporting our franchised business model to help RE/MAX brokerages, agents and both RE/MAX and Motto teams grow their businesses, connect with clients, and operate more efficiently and strategically. Providing the best online and offline experience for RE/MAX and Motto affiliates and consumers is one of our primary strategic technology goals and we expect to continue to invest meaningfully in technology as we seek to enhance our overall value proposition. These products are expected to be delivered throughout 2019.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Service Delivery – In early 2019, RE/MAX announced a new service model designed to deliver more value to our franchisees, as well as support their growth and professional development. We recognize that the needs of a new franchisee are vastly different from the needs of a larger, more established franchisee. This new service model was designed to provide franchisees with a team that will deliver holistic support services that are more dynamic, focused, relevant and impactful, as services will be based on the stage of growth in which the office currently resides. This model will allow us to put more focus on management, training, accountability and business operations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  RE/MAX intends to continue adding franchises in new and existing markets, and as a result, increase our global market share and brand awareness. Each incremental agent leverages our existing infrastructure, allowing us to drive additional revenue at little incremental cost. We are committed to reinvesting in the business to enhance our value proposition through a range of new and existing programs and tools.

 RE/MAX Office Franchise Sales

 Motto sold over 100 franchises from inception to December 31, 2018, averaging approximately 50 franchise sales per year during its first two years of operation. We believe the Motto Mortgage brokerage model extends our core competencies of franchising and real estate industry knowledge to the mortgage brokerage business. We believe Motto, with its recurring fee model, complements the RE/MAX franchise model and adds a channel for long-term growth.  Success of the Motto brokerage model, we believe, will build brand awareness which, in turn, will lead to increased franchise sales and therefore, increased franchise fees. 
 Organic Growth from Global Regions. We have a growing global presence with our agent count outside the U.S. and Canada growing almost 15% in 2018. Over the last two decades, the size of the RE/MAX network outside of the U.S. and Canada has grown to represent nearly a third of total RE/MAX agent count. However, we earn substantially more of our revenue in the U.S. than in other countries as a result of the higher average revenue per agent earned in Company-owned Regions than in Independent Regions, and in the U.S. and Canada as compared to the rest of the world:

 Pricing. Given the low fixed infrastructure cost of our RE/MAX franchise model, modest increases in aggregate fees per agent should positively affect our profitability. We may occasionally increase our aggregate fees per agent in our Company-owned Regions as we enhance the value we offer to our network. We are judicious with respect to the timing and amount of increases in aggregate fees per agent and our strategic focus remains on growing agent count through franchise sales, recruiting programs and retention initiatives. Following are the annualized average price increases for the previous five years, reflected in the year in which the increase was effective.

  Growth Catalysts through Acquisitions. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of the regional RE/MAX franchise rights in a number of Independent Regions in the U.S. and Canada, as well as other acquisitions in related areas that build on or support our core competencies in franchising and real estate. 
 Independent Region Acquisitions. The acquisition of an Independent Region franchise substantially increases our revenue per agent and provides an opportunity for us to drive enhanced profitability, as we receive a higher amount of revenue per agent in our Company-owned Regions than in our Independent Regions. While both Company-owned Regions and Independent Regions charge relatively similar fees to their brokerages and agents, we only receive a percentage of the continuing franchise fee, broker fee and initial franchise and renewal fee in Independent Regions. By acquiring regional franchise rights, we can capture 100% of these fees and substantially increase the average revenue per agent for agents in the acquired region, which, as a result of our low fixed-cost structure, further increases our overall margins. In addition, we believe we can establish operational efficiencies and improvements in financial performance of an acquired region by leveraging our existing infrastructure and experience.

 Return of Capital to Shareholders. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders as part of our value creation strategy. We have paid quarterly dividends since the completion of our first full fiscal quarter as a publicly traded company, or April of 2014.  We have annually increased our quarterly dividends since then, as we have deemed appropriate. On February 20, 2019, our Board of Directors announced a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share.
 Quarterly Dividends

 Our disciplined approach to allocating capital allows us to return capital to shareholders while investing to drive future organic growth and catalyzing growth through acquisitions. 

Competition
 RE/MAX. The residential real estate brokerage business is fragmented and highly competitive. We compete against many different types of competitors - traditional real estate brokerages; non-traditional real estate brokerages, including some that offer deeply discounted commissions to consumers, and other newer entrants, including direct buyers. We compete in different ways for franchisees, for agents, and for consumers. 
 The majority of brokerages are independent, with the best-known being regional players. At the individual office level, oftentimes our most formidable competition is that of a local, independent brokerage. Brokerages affiliated with franchises tend to be larger, on average, than independents and are part of a national network. Our largest national competitors in the U.S. and Canada include the brands operated by Realogy Holdings Corp. (including Century 21, Coldwell Banker, ERA, Sotheby’s and Better Homes and Gardens), Berkshire Hathaway Home Services, Keller Williams Realty, Inc. and Royal LePage. Our franchisees also compete to attract and retain agents against real estate franchisors which offer 100% commissions and low fees to agents. These competitors include HomeSmart and Realty ONE Group.  
 We also compete against non-traditional real estate brokerages such as Purplebricks and Redfin that offer deeply discounted commissions to consumers. Even among competitors with traditional models, there are variations such as the “hybrid” classification of Compass (a tech startup) and the virtual brokerage (no offices) platform of eXp Realty.  
 Our efforts to target consumers and connect them with a RE/MAX agent via our websites also face competition from major real estate portals, such as Zillow and Realtor.com.  
 We also compete for home sales against newer entrants, often referred to as direct buyers or iBuyers, which offer to buy homes directly from homeowners at below-market rates in exchange for speed and convenience, and then resell them shortly thereafter at market prices.  Our largest national competitors in the U.S. and Canada in this category include Opendoor, Offerpad, Redfin and Zillow.    
 Likewise, the support services we provide to RE/MAX franchisees and agents also face competition from various providers of training, back office management, marketing, social integration and lead generation services. We believe that competition in the real estate brokerage franchise business is based principally upon the reputational strength of the 

 
  23

 

brand, the quality of the services offered to franchisees, and the amount of franchise-related fees to be paid by franchisees. 
 The ability of our franchisees to compete with other real estate brokerages, both franchised and unaffiliated, is an important aspect of our growth strategy. A franchisee’s ability to compete may be affected by a variety of factors, including the number and quality of the franchisee’s independent agents and the presence and market span of the franchisee’s offices.  A franchisee’s success may also be affected by general, regional and local housing conditions, as well as overall economic conditions. 
 Motto. Motto does not originate loans, and therefore does not compete in the mortgage origination business. The mortgage origination business in which Motto franchisees participate is highly competitive. There are several different marketing channels for mortgage origination services, with some originators, like Motto franchisees, marketing significantly to real estate agents and their customers. Other originators are independent mortgage bankers or correspondent lenders, underwriting and funding mortgage loans and then selling the loans to third parties. Retail lenders, both traditional and online-only companies, and both banks and non-bank lenders, typically market their loan products directly to consumers. 
 While there are no national mortgage brokerage franchisors in the United States at the present time other than Motto, the mortgage origination business is characterized by a variety of business models. While real estate brokerage owners are our core market for the purchase of Motto franchises, such owners may form independent, non-franchised mortgage brokerages. They may enter into joint ventures with lenders for mortgage originations, and they may elect not to enter the mortgage origination business themselves, but instead earn revenue from providing marketing and other services to mortgage lenders.
 Intellectual Property 
 We regard our RE/MAX trademark, balloon logo and yard sign design trademarks as having significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing of our brand. We protect the RE/MAX and Motto brands through a combination of trademarks and copyrights. We have registered “RE/MAX” as a trademark in the U.S., Canada, and over 150 other countries and territories, and have registered various versions of the RE/MAX balloon logo and real estate yard sign design in numerous countries and territories as well. We also are the registered holder of a variety of domain names that include “remax,” “motto,” and similar variations.  Corporate Structure and Ownership
 RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. (“RE/MAX Holdings”) is a holding company incorporated in Delaware and its only business is to act as the sole manager of RMCO, LLC, (“RMCO”). In that capacity, RE/MAX Holdings operates and controls all of the business and affairs of RMCO.  RMCO is a holding company that is the direct or indirect parent of all of our operating businesses, including RE/MAX, LLC and Motto Franchising, LLC. As of December 31, 2018, RE/MAX Holdings owns 58.57% of the common units in RMCO, while RIHI, Inc. (“RIHI”) owns the remaining 41.43% of common units in RMCO. RIHI, Inc. is majority owned and controlled by David Liniger, our Chairman and Co-Founder, and by Gail Liniger, our Vice Chair and Co-Founder.

 The diagram below depicts our organizational structure:

 The holders of RE/MAX Holdings Class A common stock collectively own 100% of the economic interests in RE/MAX Holdings, while RIHI owns 100% of the outstanding shares of RE/MAX Holdings Class B common stock. 
 On October 7, 2018, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, RIHI lost its previous effective control of a majority of the voting power of RE/MAX Holdings common stock. RIHI owns all of RE/MAX Holdings’ Class B common stock which, prior to October 7, 2018, entitled RIHI to a number of votes on matters presented to RE/MAX Holdings stockholders equal to two times the number of RMCO common units that RIHI held. Effective October 7, 2018, the voting power of Class B common stock was reduced to equal the number of RMCO common units held, and therefore RIHI lost the controlling vote of RE/MAX Holdings. As a result of this change in the voting rights of the Class B common stock, RIHI no longer controls a majority of the voting power of RE/MAX Holdings’ common stock, and RE/MAX Holdings no longer constitutes a “controlled company” under the corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). RIHI remains a significant stockholder of the Company, and through its ownership of the Class B common stock, holds approximately 41% of the voting power of the Company’s stock.

 RE/MAX Holdings ownership of RMCO and Tax Receivable Agreements
 RE/MAX Holdings has twice acquired significant portions of the ownership in RMCO; first in October 2013 at the time of IPO when RE/MAX Holdings acquired its initial 11.5 million common units of RMCO and, second, in November and December 2015 when it acquired 5.2 million additional common units. RE/MAX Holdings sold Class A common stock, which it exchanged for these common units of RMCO. RIHI then sold the Class A common stock to the market. 
 When RE/MAX Holdings acquired common units in RMCO, it received a step-up in tax basis on the underlying assets held by RMCO. The step-up is principally equivalent to the difference between (1) the fair value of the underlying assets on the date of acquisition of the common units and (2) their tax basis in RMCO, multiplied by the percentage of units acquired. The majority of the step-up in basis relates to intangible assets, primarily franchise agreements and goodwill, and the step-up is often substantial. These assets are amortizable under IRS rules and result in deductions on our tax return for many years and, consequently, RE/MAX Holdings receives a future tax benefit. These future benefits are reflected within deferred tax assets of approximately $53.7 million on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018.  
 If RE/MAX Holdings acquires additional common units of RMCO from RIHI, the percentage of RE/MAX Holdings’ ownership of RMCO will increase, and additional deferred tax assets will be created as additional tax basis step-ups occur.
 In connection with the initial sale of RMCO common units in October 2013, RE/MAX Holdings entered into Tax Receivable Agreements (“TRAs”) which require that RE/MAX Holdings make annual payments to the TRA holders equivalent to 85% of any tax benefits realized on each year’s tax return from the additional tax deductions arising from the step-up in tax basis. We believe 85% is common for tax receivable agreements. The TRA holders as of December 31, 2018 are RIHI and Parallaxes Rain Co-Investment, LLC (“Parallaxes”). TRA liabilities were established for the future cash obligations expected to be paid under the TRAs and are not discounted. As of December 31, 2018, this liability was $40.8 million. Similar to the deferred tax assets, the TRA liabilities would increase if RE/MAX Holdings acquires additional common units of RMCO from RIHI.
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 500 employees. Our franchisees are independent businesses. Their employees and independent contractor sales agents are therefore not included in our employee count. None of our employees are represented by a union.  Seasonality 
 The residential housing market is seasonal, with transactional activity in the U.S. and Canada peaking in the second and third quarter of each year. Our results of operations are somewhat affected by these seasonal trends. Our Adjusted EBITDA margins are often lower in the first and fourth quarters due primarily to the impact of lower broker fees and other revenue as a result of lower overall sales volume, as well as higher selling, operating and administrative expenses in the first quarter for expenses incurred in connection with the RE/MAX annual convention.  Government Regulation 
 Franchise Regulation. The sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws, as well as by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosures to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. A number of states require registration or disclosure by franchisors in connection with franchise offers and sales. Several states also have “franchise relationship laws” or “business opportunity laws” that limit the ability of the franchisor to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. The states with relationship or other statutes governing the termination of franchises include Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. Some franchise relationship statutes require a mandated notice period for termination; some require a notice and cure period; and some require that the franchisor demonstrate 

 
  26

 

good cause for termination. Although we believe that our franchise agreements comply with these statutory requirements, failure to comply with these laws could result in our company incurring civil liability. In addition, while historically our franchising operations have not been materially adversely affected by such regulation, we cannot predict the effect of any future federal or state legislation or regulation. 
 Real Estate and Mortgage Regulation. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”) and state real estate brokerage laws and mortgage regulations restrict payments which real estate brokers, mortgage brokers, and other service providers in the real estate industry may receive or pay in connection with the sales of residences and referral of settlement services, such as real estate brokerage, mortgages, homeowners insurance and title insurance. Such laws affect the terms that we may offer in our franchise agreements with Motto franchisees and may to some extent restrict preferred vendor programs, both for Motto and RE/MAX. Federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances related to the origination of mortgages, may affect other aspects of the Motto business, including the extent to which we can obtain data on Motto franchisees’ compliance with their franchise agreements. These laws and regulations include (i) the Federal Truth in Lending Act of 1969 (“TILA”), and Regulation Z (“Reg Z”) thereunder; (ii) the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act ("ECOA'') and Regulation B thereunder; (iii) the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V thereunder; (iv) RESPA, and Regulation X thereunder; (v) the Fair Housing Act; (vi) the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act; (vii) the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing regulations; (viii) the Consumer Financial Protection Act and its implementing regulations; (ix) the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act-FACT ACT and its implementing regulations; and (x) the Do Not Call/Do Not Fax Act and other state and federal laws pertaining to the solicitation of consumers.
