  Item 1. Business
  We are a Delaware corporation whose principal office is located at 60 E. 42nd Street, Suite 4600, New York, NY 10165. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms we, us, our, or the Company as used herein refer to PwrCor, Inc. and our subsidiaries, Cornerstone Program Advisors LLC (Cornerstone) and Sustainable Energy Industries, Inc. (Sustainable). Until March 3, 2017, the Company was named Receivable Acquisition & Management Corporation, and did business as Cornerstone Sustainable Energy.  Description of the Business
  The Company specializes in delivering energy infrastructure and alternative energy solutions to a range of commercial customers and to institutions such as hospitals and universities. The Company has begun to expand and transform its business to take advantage of opportunities in the alternative energy and clean energy arenas.  The Company has two major business components. The first major business component is the management of infrastructure projects for commercial and institutional customers. These projects typically involve some combination of energy infrastructure components, including electrical power generation, steam production, or chilled water production, as well as the infrastructure to distribute these services. Generally, the Company acts as the representative of the customer in overseeing and managing an infrastructure project, or can take the role of project developer under an agreement with the customer. The Company has competitors, some of which are very large and well-recognized. However, in the non-profit hospital and university market in its geographical scope of operation, has developed a reputation for excellence and an established market position. The Company operates in this first business component under its subsidiary, Cornerstone, a Delaware limited liability company, which it acquired in a merger on May 15, 2013 (the Merger).  The second major business component is the commercialization of its own proprietary engine technology which converts low-grade heat to mechanical energy. The Company is actively marketing the technology particularly for power generation, and installed the first of its engines approximately a year ago. The technology used is non-polluting and entirely green. Based on its knowledge of the industry, management believes that the Companys technology is arguably superior to all other lower-temperature engine technologies, such as those utilizing the organic Rankine physical cycle, and operates effectively at lower temperature ranges and heat flow volume than any others in the market. The engines in this configuration promise to deliver substantial cost savings in most client applications, and are not unusually costly as compared to competing technologies. Although the engine is readily built to order of common parts and components, continued material investments are expected to be required by the Company. The Company has generated initial revenues through this business component. The Company operates in this second major business component under its subsidiary, Sustainable, a New York corporation, which it acquired in the Merger.  The Companys primary markets are (i) large domestic non-profit institutions and organizations, particularly where electricity rates are high, and currently localized in the Northeast; (ii) the waste-heat-to-energy and geothermal marketplace, primarily domestic, typically power generation; and (iii) the independent power producer market, also primarily domestic. All of these markets are large and multifaceted with no dominant customers.  Cornerstone is an energy infrastructure project management company focused on healthcare and higher learning institutions. Sustainable is focused on the alternative energy business, with an emphasis on its proprietary green engine technology.  Prior to 2013, the Company was in the business of acquiring portfolios of performing, sub-performing and non-performing consumer and commercial receivables. The Company is no longer in this business; however, it has had minimal revenues from collections on a remaining portfolio of non-performing consumer and commercial receivables.    1   Strategy
  The Company is pursuing three growth initiatives:  (1) Acquiring and applying cleantech solutions - technology, equipment and methods to solve client needs and provide a competitive advantage, such as cleantech engine technology. In the first such acquisition, the Company merged with Sustainable, the holder of manufacturing and sales rights for an engine technology that has since been abandoned by the Company in favor of a superior technology for which it has committed development resources in research and development, and for which it has acquired exclusive worldwide rights under an agreement described in the section beginning at the bottom of this page.  (2) Making strategic acquisitions and entering into strategic joint ventures in and around its core areas of expertise. The first of these was in cleantech, described directly above. Other potential acquisition or merger targets are continually under review. They must meet rigorous financial and growth criteria, offer a strategic fit, and expand the market or competitive position of the Company. Targets include those in the clean water, bio incineration, waste heat recovery, and clean engine technologies.  (3) Establishing and leveraging alliances, a number of which are established or in some level of development. We also intend to source business by helping companies offer a uniquely competitive financing and development platform to existing and prospective non-profit clients such as universities, hospitals and municipalities.  For the most part, power technologies are well known and widely available. The Company is focused on selecting the right technology or technologies for each project, and maintaining a constant focus on both cost effectiveness for the client and financial returns to the Company. To enhance its competitive position, however, the Company will focus on obtaining exclusive market positions and enhancing its technological strengths.  Industry Overview
  The general marketplace for the Companys offerings is composed of large consumers and producers of power which have an interest in (a) reducing energy consumption, (b) reducing the cost of energy, (c) improving the environmental profile of their energy production, or (d) some combination of these. The Company is engaged in this overall energy infrastructure industry at two separate points. These sub-industries, or markets, are relatively distinct, albeit related, so each will be described separately.  One market is composed of consumers of large amounts of energy, including large hospitals, colleges and universities. These institutions often operate large, and frequently aging, centralized utility plant and infrastructure installations which provide heat (typically steam), cooling (chilled water), and power to a sizeable campus of buildings. Energy infrastructure upgrades and improvements are often required to provide for expansion of campus facilities, replace aging equipment, and reduce the cost and/or the amount of their energy consumption. The Company, acting as the clients representative, helps design and develop upgrades to or replacements of such facilities, and then oversees the implementation projects for these institutions. The Company may act as project developer or co-developer, and offers to arrange or assist in the project financing. Projects are typically multi-year commitments and often complex.  The other market is the waste-heat-to-energy industry. The industry involves technologies for converting wasted heat or geothermal heat to power production. One example is the enormous and largely unexploited low-grade geothermal market. Vast geothermal resources are currently untapped because earlier technologies were incapable of converting low-grade heat and low volume heat flows into power. The Company has a proprietary technology that can be utilized to convert this enormous natural resource into baseload power.      2   Technology Market, License and Agreements
  The waste-heat-to-energy market, typical of the power production industry, relies heavily on experience, and the Companys technology is relatively new and has little track record. However, the scale of the available resource is so sizeable that there is a great deal of interest in developing it. The market potential has not been accurately measured because no technology existed to develop it. However, it is estimated that the energy available from lower temperature geothermal resources is a multiple of the energy tapped at higher temperature levels. The geothermal market in the U.S. alone has approximately 3200MW of installed capacity. Almost all the added capacity increase in the past two decades has utilized lower temperature resources, yet far from as low as those at which the Companys technology can operate. Currently, an additional 4300MW is in some stage of development, representing an anticipated investment of some $13-$17 billion. Although the Companys technology can be configured to operate in the entire range of temperatures, its prime market is in these untapped lower temperature resources. This is in addition to a related market opportunity for adding this technology to capture waste heat from existing higher-temperature geothermal plants in a bottoming cycle, enabling them to increase output from an already-tapped resource.  The Company's technology is also well suited to the waste heat recovery market as related to industries that create wasted heat as a result of their manufacturing or production processes. This market is well defined and, according to a report published by the U.S. Department of Energy, The United States industrial sector accounts for approximately one-third of all energy used in the United States, consuming approximately 32 quadrillion (million billion) BTUs of energy annually and emitting about 1,680 million metric tons of carbon dioxide associated with this energy use. The opportunity in the waste heat recovery market is substantial. The report continues, A valuable alternative approach to improving overall energy efficiency is to capture and reuse the lost or waste heat that is intrinsic to all industrial manufacturing. During these manufacturing processes, as much as 20% to 50% of the energy consumed is ultimately lost via waste heat contained in streams of hot exhaust gases and liquids, as well as through heat conduction, convection, and radiation from hot equipment surfaces and from heated product streams. In some cases, such as industrial furnaces, waste heat recovery can improve energy efficiency by 10% to as much as 50%.  The advantage of recapturing and utilizing waste heat is that it typically replaces purchased electric power, much of which does and will continue to require burning fossil fuels, or directly replaces fuels which must be purchased and combusted. Thus it actually can directly reduce emissions and eliminate transmission losses. Projections of market potential are truly enormous, with unrecovered waste heat in industrial processes estimated at half a quintillion (billion billion) BTUs.  In the third quarter of 2017, when patents had expired on technology the Company had licensed from a third party, the Company terminated the agreements it had with that party, a business which had not successfully commercialized its technology and which no longer had any active business.  In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company finalized an intellectual property License Agreement with Thermal Tech Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (TTH). TTH is an affiliated entity owned equally by two entities affiliated, respectively, with two officers and directors of the Company, who also serve in management positions with TTH. TTH is the owner of certain patent applications and the inventions relating to the Companys proprietary engine technology (the Licensed Patents and Technical Information). The Licensed Patents and Technical Information were developed by an independent non-profit research institute (the Contractor). All work done by the Contractor for the patent applications and inventions licensed thereunder was paid for by TTH. TTH, rather than the Company, was at risk if the research, development, engineering and design work were of little or no value. Furthermore, the work performed by the Contractor for TTH was confidential for competitive business reasons.  The Patent License grants the Company a worldwide license to use the Technical Information to make, use or sell any products (the Licensed Products) and/or services which would be covered by any Licensed Patent. As an entity organized to develop, acquire, and/or improve thermal energy technologies, TTH owns or controls various intellectual property it is engaged in offering for licensing purposes. Although the Patent License is non-exclusive, TTH may not license these specific Licensed Patents and Technical Information to any competitive entity, or to any other entity without the prior written consent of the Company.  3   The Company agreed to pay TTH a royalty equal to five (5%) percent of the Net Revenue (as defined) of all Licensed Products covered by a Licensed Patent sold by the Company and its affiliates, as well as an initial license fee of $135,000, towards which $94,500 was paid in 2017. The Patent License will terminate upon the expiration of all Licensed Patents. The Company may terminate the agreement on ninety (90) days prior written notice. TTH may terminate the agreement on ninety (90) days prior written notice for uncured defaults (as defined).  The Company has branded its engine technology PwrCor.  On December 27, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Modoc County, California, to supply its PwrCor engine as part of a demonstration project that converts ultra-low-grade heat into electricity. The heat is being obtained from a geothermal hot spring which comes to the surface at temperatures of approximately 190° F.  Funding was arranged by Modoc County via a grant from the California Energy Commission with the Company entitled to revenues of up to $123,624 while being responsible for expenses of up to $54,000. The project manager was Modoc County. In early 2018, the PwrCor engine was delivered, installed, demonstrated to produce electricity as agreed, and accepted by the client.  As of year end 2018, certain infrastructure modifications required to be made by other parties as specified for the continued operation of the engine have not been completed, so the unit is standing by but not currently operating.  Employees
  As of December 31, 2018, the Company had four consultants as officers under consulting agreements, with Thomas Telegades, the CEO and interim CFO; Peter Fazio, the COO; Wallace Baker, the Chief Administrative Officer and Corporate Secretary; and James Valentino, the non-executive Chairman; and no part-time employees. See Item 11 Executive Compensation below. Carefully selected contractors are used for managing infrastructure projects, matched to the needs of these clients. Their staffing levels vary depending on the number and size of infrastructure projects underway. The Company prefers to outsource non-core, non-critical activities wherever possible, including manufacturing activities.
