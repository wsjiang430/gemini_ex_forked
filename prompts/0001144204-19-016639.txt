ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Ridgefield Acquisition Corp. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “Ridgefield” or the “Company”) was originally incorporated as a Colorado corporation on October 13, 1983 under the name Ozo Diversified, Inc. On June 23, 2006, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada that effected the merger between the Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary formed under the laws of the State of Nevada ("RAC-NV"), pursuant to the Articles of Merger, whereby RAC-NV was the surviving corporation. The merger changed the domicile of the Company from the State of Colorado to the State of Nevada. Furthermore, as a result of the Articles of Merger the Company is authorized to issue 35,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 30,000,000 shares of common stock, $.001 par value per share and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par value per share.
 
On March 9, 1999, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of its assets to JOT Automation, Inc. (the "JOT Transaction"). As a result of the JOT Transaction, the Company's historical business, with operations consisting primarily involving depaneling and routing businesses, was considered to be a "discontinued operation" and, consequently, provides no benefit to persons seeking to understand the Company's financial condition or results of operations. Following the JOT Transaction, the Company devoted its efforts to the development of a prototype micro-robotic device (the "micro-robotic device") to manipulate organic tissues on an extremely small scale. Due to the inability to complete the micro-robotic device, the Company determined that it would cease the development of the micro-robotic device and, as of June 30, 2000, the capitalized costs related to the patent underlying the micro-robotic device were written off by the Company.
 
On March 19, 2002, the Company was awarded United States Patent No. US 6,358,749 B1 for the "Automated System for Chromosome Microdissection and Method of Using Same" (the "Patent"). During the first quarter of 2003, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the formation of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company for the purposes of owning, developing and exploiting the Patent. On March 3, 2003, the Company filed Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to form Bio-Medical Automation, Inc., a Nevada corporation wholly-owned by the Company ("Bio-Medical" or the "Subsidiary"). In May 2003, the Company transferred the Patent to the Subsidiary in exchange for 100% of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the Subsidiary. The Company never derived any revenues from the Patent.
 
As of December 31, 2016, Bio-Medical had 35,000,000 shares of capital stock authorized for issuance consisting of (1) 30,000,000 shares of common stock par value $.001 per share; and (2) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock par value $.01 per share. Bio-Medical has 1,140,773 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding, all of which are owned by the Company. Bio-Medical has no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding. A copy of the Articles of Incorporation and bylaws of Bio-Medical are attached to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the year ended December 31, 2005 as Exhibit 3.6 and Exhibit 3.7, respectively, and such documents are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Since July 2000, the Company has suspended all operations, except for necessary administrative matters relating to the timely filing of periodic reports as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company is a “shell company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Act. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2018 we earned no revenues.

Acquisition Strategy
 
Our plan of operation is to arrange for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity. We have not identified a viable operating entity for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement, and there can be no assurance that the Company will ever successfully arrange for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity.
 
We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity will be a complex process and will involve a number of risks, because potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and may be in various stages of development. Due in part to economic conditions in a number of geographic areas, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, we believe that there are numerous firms seeking either the limited additional capital which the Company will have or the benefits of a publicly traded corporation, or both. The perceived benefits of a publicly traded corporation may include facilitating or improving the terms upon which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for principal shareholders, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and other factors.

In some cases, management of the Company will have the authority to effect acquisitions without submitting the proposal to the shareholders for their consideration. In some instances, however, the proposed participation in a business opportunity may be submitted to the shareholders for their consideration, either voluntarily by the Board of Directors to seek the shareholders' advice and consent, or because of a requirement of state law to do so.
 
In seeking to arrange a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity, our objective will be to obtain long-term capital appreciation for the Company's shareholders. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity.
 
The Company may need additional funds in order to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity, although there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional funds, if needed. Even if we are able to obtain additional funds there is no assurance that the Company will be able to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity.
 
Competition
 
In connection with its Acquisition Strategy, the Company expects to encounter intense competition from other entities having business objectives similar to those of the Company. Many of these entities, including venture capital firms, blind pool companies, large industrial and financial institutions, small business investment companies and wealthy individuals, are well-established and have extensive experience in connection with identifying and effecting acquisitions directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than the Company and there can be no assurance that the Company will have the ability to compete successfully with such entities. The Company's financial resources will be limited in comparison to those of many of its competitors. The Company's limited financial resources may compel the Company to select certain less attractive acquisition prospects.
Employees
 
As of March 28, 2019, the Company had 1 employee, Steven N. Bronson, who serves as the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer but takes no salary. The Company does not have any employees that are represented by a union or other collective bargaining group.
