ITEM 1. Business
Overview
We provide technology-enabled audit, recovery, and analytics services in the United States primarily to the healthcare industry. We work with healthcare payers through claims auditing and eligibility-based (also known as coordination-of-benefits or COB) services to identify improper payments. We engage clients in both government and commercial markets. We also have a call center which serves clients with multifaceted consumer engagement needs. Our clients typically operate in complex and highly regulated environments and contract for their payment integrity needs in order to reduce losses on improper healthcare payments. 
We historically worked in recovery markets such as defaulted student loans, federal treasury and state tax receivables. These markets are no longer a focus of the Company. 
We believe we have a leading position in our markets based on our technology-enabled services platform, long-standing client relationships, and the large volume of claims or funds we have audited and recovered for our clients. Further, we believe that our business platforms are adaptable to new markets and new processes and service offerings within our existing markets. We continue to enhance our platforms through investments in new data and analytics capabilities, which we believe will enable us to provide additional services related to the detection of fraud, waste and abuse. We endeavor to automate and optimize what traditionally have been manually intensive processes in order to drive higher workforce productivity. In 2022, we generated approximately $110,000 of revenue per employee compared to $118,000 of revenue per employee in 2021, based on the average number of employees during each of the years, respectively.
Our revenue model is generally success-based as we earn fees on the aggregate correct audits and/or amount of funds that we enable our clients to recover. Our services do not require significant upfront investments by our clients and we offer our clients the opportunity to recover significant funds that may otherwise be lost. Because our model is based upon the success of our efforts, our business objectives are aligned with those of our clients and we are generally not reliant on their spending budgets. 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated approximately $109.2 million in revenues, $6.5 million in net loss, $0.9 million in adjusted EBITDA, and $5.2 million in adjusted net loss. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income” in Item 7 below for a definition of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income and reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss to net income (loss) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Our Markets
We operate in markets characterized by strong growth, a complex regulatory environment and a significant amount of delinquent, defaulted or improperly paid assets.
Healthcare Market
The healthcare industry represents a significant portion of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP). According to Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) National Health Expenditure (NHE) Projections, U.S. healthcare spending grew 2.7% in 2021, reaching $4.3 trillion from $4.1 trillion in 2020. National health spending is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.5% for 2018-27 and to reach nearly $6.2 trillion by 2028. As a share of the nation's GDP, national healthcare spending accounted for 18.3% in 2021, a decrease from 19.7% in 2020. Federal government-related spending grew 8.4% to $900.8 billion in 2021 for Medicare, which provides a range of healthcare coverage primarily to elderly and disabled Americans and grew 9.2% to $734.0 billion in 2021 for Medicaid, which provides federal matching funds for states to finance healthcare for individuals at or below the public assistance level. Over 2021-30, Medicare spending is projected to increase to an average rate of 7.4% per year. Over 2021-23, Medicaid spending is projected to increase to an average rate of 5.5%.
Medicare was initially established as part of the Social Security Act of 1965 and consists of four parts: Part A covers hospital and other inpatient stays; Part B covers hospital outpatient, physician and other services; Part C is known as Medicare Advantage, under which beneficiaries receive benefits through private health plans; and Part D is the Medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit.
CMS estimated that for Medicare Part A and Part B spending in 2020, approximately $25.7 billion, or 6.3%, was improper. Medicare improper payments generally involve incorrect coding, procedures performed which were not medically necessary, and incomplete documentation or claims submitted based on outdated fee schedules, among other issues. 
In addition to government-related healthcare spending, significant growth in spending is expected in the private healthcare market. According to CMS NHE Projections, the private healthcare market accounted for approximately $1.2 trillion in spending in 2021. Private healthcare expenditures are projected to grow by 4.6% per year on average from 2021 through 2023 and 5.0% per year on average from 2024 through 2028.
Recovery Market
During 2021, we sold certain of our non-healthcare recovery contracts and did not renew or restart existing contracts in the recovery market, nor pursue new non-healthcare recovery contracts. Accordingly, we no longer derive significant revenues from the student lending debt recovery, state tax, or the federal agency recovery markets.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that our business is difficult to replicate, as it incorporates a combination of several important and differentiated elements, including:
•Scalable and flexible technology-enabled services platform. We have a purpose-built technology platform that is highly flexible, intuitive and easy to use for our audit, eligibility, and claims specialists. Our flexible platform is configurable and deployable across multiple markets and processes. For example, we have successfully implemented our platform across multiple healthcare offerings within claims auditing and other eligibility-based offerings, each having its own process complexities and nuances.
•Advanced, technology-enabled workflow processes. Our technology-enabled workflow processes, developed and refined over many years of operational experience enable us to disaggregate otherwise complex audit and recovery processes into a series of simple, efficient and consistent steps that are configurable and applicable to processing different types of services. We believe our workflow software is highly intuitive, which enables our audit and other claims specialists to manage each step of the Performant operational process, while automating a series of otherwise manually intensive and document-intensive steps. We believe our streamlined workflow technology drives higher efficiencies in our operations, as illustrated by our ability to generate approximately $110,000 of revenues per employee during 2022, based on the average number of employees during the year. We believe our streamlined workflow technology and processes also improve audit and recovery results relative to more labor-intensive outsourcing models. 
•Strong data and analytics capabilities. Our data and analytics capabilities allow us to achieve strong audit results, eligibility matching, and recovery rates for our clients. We have a proprietary data management and analysis platform which we use throughout our business. We have assembled a large amount of healthcare-related performance data for over a decade, which we combine with large volumes of client and third-party data to effectively analyze our clients’ claims and other data for improper payments. We have also developed a number of analytical models for claims auditing, and analytics tools that we use to score our clients’ inventory, determine the optimal workflow process and allocation of resources, and achieve higher levels of results for our clients. In addition, we utilize analytics tools to continuously measure and test our workflow processes to drive refinements and further enhance the quality and effectiveness of our capabilities.
•Long-standing client relationships. We believe our long-standing focus on achieving superior performance for our clients and the significant value our clients derive from this focus have helped us achieve long-tenured client relationships, strong contract retention and better access to new clients and future growth opportunities. For example, our relationship with CMS spans over fourteen years, and our relationships with our earliest commercial clients in the healthcare industry have been in place for almost a decade. 
•Extensive domain expertise in complex and regulated markets. We have extensive experience and domain expertise in providing services for government and private institutions that generally operate in complex and regulated markets. We have demonstrated our ability to develop domain expertise in varied markets such as healthcare and other state and federal level entities. We believe we have the organizational experience that is required to understand and adapt to changes in the regulatory environment and overall objectives of our clients as a result of ongoing changes in public policy. Further, we believe this helps us identify and anticipate growth opportunities. For example, we successfully identified government healthcare as a potential growth opportunity that has thus far led to the award of seven contracts to us by CMS. Together with our flexible technology platform, we have the ability to adapt our business strategy, to allocate resources and to respond to changes in our regulatory environment to capitalize on new growth opportunities. 
•Culture of innovation and client service philosophy enables continuous improvement and expanded value creation. We have a concerted focus on developing new payment integrity concepts to increase savings for our clients. We have a collaborative approach to identify and resolve client payment integrity needs, with an emphasis on growing our customer pipeline in the healthcare market to serve mid-sized private healthcare plans that have historically been underserved by larger platforms. We typically target our client sales efforts into a cross functional matrix of client decision makers across payment integrity, finance, provider network management and clinical policy to drive expansion in our sales efforts.
•Proven and experienced management team. Our management team has significant industry experience and has demonstrated strong execution capabilities. Our senior management team, led by Lisa Im and Simeon Kohl, has been with us for an average of approximately 21 years. This team has successfully grown our revenue base and service offerings beyond the original student loan market into healthcare, and delinquent state and federal tax receivables. Our management team’s industry experience, combined with deep and specialized understanding of complex and highly regulated industries, has enabled us to maintain long-standing client relationships and strong financial results.
Our Growth Strategy
Key elements of our growth strategy include the following:
•Expand our payment integrity services in the healthcare market. According to CMS NHE Projections for expenditures in Medicare, Medicaid, and private healthcare will be in the trillions of dollars annually through 2028. As these large markets continue to grow, we expect the need for Performant's offerings to increase in the public and private healthcare markets. We have established relationships and contracts with both CMS and private healthcare plans on a national and regional level. We have a muti-pronged growth strategy for the healthcare market, divided amongst national, mid-tier and smaller health plans. These strategies include a combination of growth within our existing client base, as well as adding new clients. In doing so, we intend to pursue growth opportunities to provide audit and eligibility matching services for our clients’ both prior to and post payment for healthcare services, including the detection of fraud, waste, and abuse. 
•Pursue strategic alliances and acquisitions. We may selectively consider opportunities to grow through strategic alliances or acquisitions that are complementary to our business. These opportunities may enhance our existing capabilities, enable us to enter new markets, expand our product offerings and allow us to diversify our revenues.
Our Platform
Our data management, analytics, and technology-enabled services platform is proprietary and based on over two decades of experience in auditing and recovering large amounts of funds on behalf of our clients across several markets. The components of our platform include our data management expertise, data analytics capabilities and technology-based workflow processes. Our platform integrates these components to allow us to achieve optimized outcomes for our clients in the form of increased efficiency and productivity and high efficacy rates. Our platform and workflow processes are also intuitive and easy to use for our healthcare claims specialists, which allow us to increase our employee retention and productivity.
The components of our platform include the following:
Data Management Expertise
Our platform manages and stores large amounts of data throughout our workflow process. This data includes a combination of both publicly-available information, as well as proprietary and client specific data, the combination of which creates a robust input for claims review and selections. We are able to integrate these sources efficiently and in real-time to reduce errors, reduce cycle time processing and, ultimately, improve audit finding and recovery rates. The strength of our data management expertise augments our data analytics capabilities and provides our healthcare claims specialists with powerful workflow processes.
Data Analytics Capabilities
Our data analytics capabilities are designed to efficiently screen and allocate massive volumes of claims inventory. For example, we analyze millions of healthcare claims with customized payment integrity algorithms to find potential correlations between claims data and improper payments, which enhance our finding rates. We utilize our proprietary analytics tools across all of our current markets and clients to continuously and rigorously test our workflow processes in real-time in order to drive greater process efficiency and improvement in recoupment rates.
Furthermore, we believe our data analytics capabilities will enable us to extend our potential product offerings within the healthcare market, permitting us to pursue significant new business opportunities. 
Workflow Processes
Over many years, we have developed and refined our workflow processes, which we believe drive higher efficiency and productivity and reduce our reliance on labor-intensive methods relative to more traditional outsourcing models. Our technology supports our proprietary workflows to disaggregate otherwise complex processes into a series of simple, efficient and consistent steps that are easily configurable and applicable to different types of applications. These allow subject matter experts to quickly review analytical outputs and achieve targeted audit and recovery outcomes for our clients. 
The following diagram illustrates how our technology platform fits into our operational ecosystem:

Healthcare
We provide payment integrity services related to improper payments in the healthcare market, serving both government and commercial clients. Within the healthcare market, we have strong and established relationships with multiple government agencies across our various product lines.
 In October 2016, we were awarded two RAC contracts by CMS. One of these RAC contracts, which was subsequently re-awarded to us in 2021 for an eight-and-a-half year term, covers Parts A and B Medicare payments in Region 1. The second RAC contract involves post-payment review of DMEPOS and home health and hospice claims across the entire U.S. In November 2022, we were awarded a third RAC contract by CMS which is for an eight-and-a-half year term and covers Parts A and B Medicare payments in Region 2.
Under our RAC contracts with CMS, we utilize our technology-enabled services platform to screen Medicare claims against several criteria, including coding procedures and medical necessity standards, to determine whether a claim should be further investigated for recoupment or adjustment by CMS. We conduct automated and, where appropriate, detailed medical necessity reviews. If we determine that the likelihood of finding a potential improper payment warrants further investigation, we request and review healthcare provider medical records related to the claim, utilizing experts in Medicare coding and registered nurses. We interact and communicate with healthcare providers and other administrative entities, and ultimately submit the claim to CMS for correction.
In October 2017, we were awarded the national exclusive MSP contract by CMS. This contract was subsequently re-awarded to us in December 2022. Under our MSP contract with CMS, we are responsible for identifying and recovering payments in situations where Medicare should not be the primary payer of healthcare claims because a beneficiary has other forms of insurance coverage, such as through an employer group health plan or certain other insurance payers.
In January 2022, we were awarded the indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General (HHS OIG), which has a base term of one year and four additional one-year options. Under this contract, we provide medical review and consultative services associated with the oversight activities of the HHS OIG, primarily assessing services and claims for Medicare fee-for-service payments for Part A and Part B.
In the private healthcare market, we have entered into numerous private insurance payer contracts and are pursuing additional opportunities to provide audit, recovery, and analytics services. We utilize our technology-enabled services platform to provide audit, recovery, and analytics services for private healthcare payers. Our experience from our contracts with CMS has helped establish our presence in the private healthcare market resulting in opportunities for us to provide audit and recovery services for several national and regional commercial health plans. Our audit and analytics capabilities have allowed us not only to expand our services with these initial private healthcare clients, but also gain entry into other related private healthcare opportunities. 
The illustration below provides examples of certain types of improper payments that we audit on behalf of our clients in the healthcare market.
Recovery
We have historically worked in recovery markets such as defaulted student loans, federal treasury and state tax receivables, and commercial recovery. These markets are no longer a focus of the Company.
Customer Care / Outsourced Services
We derive revenues from first party call center and other outsourced services. Our revenues for these services include contingency fees, fees based on dedicated headcount, and tasks completed on behalf of our clients.
Analytics Capabilities
For several years, we have leveraged our data analytics tools to help filter, identify audit claims and recover delinquent and defaulted assets and improper payments as part of our core services platform. Through our data analytics capabilities, which we refer to as Performant Insight, we are able to review, aggregate, and synthesize very large volumes of structured and unstructured data, at high speeds, from the initial intake of disparate data sources to the warehousing of the data, to the analysis and reporting of the data. We believe we have built a differentiated, next-generation “end-to-end” data processing solution that will maximize value for current and future customers.
Performant Insight provides numerous benefits for our audit and recovery services platform. Performant Insight has not only enhanced our existing services under our contracts with CMS and other private healthcare contracts by analyzing significantly higher volumes of healthcare claims at faster rates and reducing our cycle time to review and assess healthcare claims, but it has also enabled us to develop improved and more sophisticated business intelligence rules that can be applied to our audit processes. We believe our analytics capabilities will extend our potential markets, permitting us to pursue significant new business opportunities. We have expanded the use of our data analytics capabilities in the healthcare sector to offer a variety of services from post and pre-payment audit of healthcare claims in both the public and private healthcare sector, to detection of fraud, waste and abuse of healthcare claims, to coordination of benefits and pharmacy fraud detection. 
Our Clients
We provide our services across a range of government and private clients.
CMS
Our relationship with CMS extends approximately fourteen years. Under our first RAC contract with CMS, which was initially awarded in 2008 and expired in 2016, we were responsible for identifying and facilitating the recovery of improper Part A and Part B Medicare payments in the Northeast region of the United States. 
In October 2016, we were awarded two new RAC contracts with CMS. We received the contract to audit improper payments for claims made under Medicare Parts A and B in Region 1, which consists of eleven states (Connecticut, Michigan, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Kentucky, Rhode Island and Vermont), and the contract for Region 5, which involves post-payment review of claims related to DMEPOS and home health and hospice across the U.S. The fees that we receive for identifying improper payments from CMS under these contracts are entirely contingency-based, and the contingency-fee percentage depends on the methods of recovery, and, in some cases, the type of improper payment that we identify. In March of 2021, we were re-awarded the CMS Region 1 contract with a term of eight-and-a-half years. 
Additionally, in November 2022, we were awarded the RAC contract to audit improper payments for claims made under Medicare Parts A and B in Region 2, which consists of 14 states (Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi). Our RAC contract for Region 2 has a term of eight-and-a-half years.
In October 2017, we were awarded the national exclusive MSP contract by CMS. Under this MSP contract, we are responsible for coordination-of-benefits claims, which includes identifying and recovering payments in situations where Medicare should not be the primary payer of healthcare claims because a beneficiary has other forms of insurance coverage, such as through an employer group health plan or certain other payers. We commenced operations on the MSP contract in 2018. We were re-awarded this contract in December 2022, with an expected commencement in March 2023.
Private Healthcare
In the private healthcare market, we utilize our technology-enabled services platform to provide audit, recovery and analytical services for private healthcare payers. Our experience from our contracts with CMS has helped establish our presence in the private healthcare market by providing us the opportunity to provide audit and recovery services for several national and regional commercial health plans. Our audit and analytics capabilities have allowed us not only to expand our services with these initial private healthcare clients, but also gain entry into other related private healthcare opportunities with numerous other plans.
Sales and Marketing
Our new business opportunities have historically been driven largely by referrals and natural extensions of our existing client relationships, as well as a targeted outreach by our sales team and senior management. Our sales cycles are often lengthy, and demand high levels of attention from our senior management. At any point in time, we are typically focused on a limited number of potentially significant new business opportunities. As a result, to date, we have operated with a small sales and marketing team of experienced individuals with responsibility for developing new sales working in concert with our executive staff.
Technology Operations
Our technology operations are Livermore, California, with primary and redundant datacenters located in Santa Clara, California and Fort Worth, Texas. We have designed our infrastructure for scalability and redundancy, which allows us to continue to operate in the event of an outage at any of our datacenters. We maintain an information systems environment with dedicated information technology and security teams managing an advanced architecture focused on network security intrusion detection, data loss prevention and training of staff with 24x7 monitoring and security incident response capabilities. We utilize encryption technologies certified to FIPS 140-2 to protect sensitive data on our systems, all data during transmission and all data on redundancy or backup solutions. We also maintain a comprehensive enterprise-wide information security program certified by 3rd party auditors that is based on industry standards such as HITRUST, ARS 5.0,NIST 800-53, SOC 1 Type II and PCI/DSS. 
Competition
We face significant competition in all aspects of our business. 
In the audit and recovery of improper healthcare payments, we face competition in the bidding process for commercial healthcare contracts, and the RAC and MSP contracts awarded by CMS. However, based on the effective audit solutions that we have provided to CMS and private healthcare plans, we believe we are well qualified to compete for new contract awards within the healthcare market. This qualification allows us to compete more effectively for contracts such as the CMS RAC Region 1 contract, which we were re-awarded in March 2021, and the RAC Region 2 contract, which we were awarded in November 2022. In the most recent RAC bidding process, the identified competitive factors were demonstrated experience in effective recovery services in the healthcare market, sufficient capacity to address claims volumes, maintenance of high standards of operational practices, financial capability to perform under the RAC contracts and fee rates. In the private healthcare market, these same factors are generally important and applicable. Our competition in the private healthcare market includes the other RAC service providers, (including Cotiviti, LLC and Cotiviti GOV Services (formerly Health Management Systems, Inc.)), and a variety of healthcare consulting and healthcare information services companies. Many of these companies have greater financial, technological and other resources than we do.
Government Regulation
The nature of our current healthcare business and our legacy recovery business requires that we adhere to a complex array of federal and state laws and regulations. These include, but are not limited to, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, the False Claims Act, or FCA, the Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, the Exclusion Statute, the Privacy Act of 1974, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, or FDCPA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, the rules and regulations established by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, and related state laws. We are also governed by a variety of state laws that regulate the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information. We have implemented and maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards intended to protect all personal data and we have processes in place to assist us in complying with applicable laws and regulations regarding the protection of this data. Our compliance efforts include training of personnel and monitoring of our systems and personnel.
HIPAA and Related State Laws
Our healthcare business subjects us to compliance with HIPAA and various related state laws that contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of an individual’s protected health information. HIPAA prohibits us from using or disclosing an individual’s protected health information unless the use or disclosure is authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under HIPAA. Under HIPAA, we must establish administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by us or by others on our behalf. We are required to notify affected individuals and government authorities of data security breaches involving unsecured protected health information. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights enforces HIPAA privacy violations; CMS enforces HIPAA security violations and the Department of Justice enforces criminal violations of HIPAA. 
Most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the unauthorized disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards and data security breach notification requirements. These state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we must comply with them even though they may be subject to different interpretations by various courts and other governmental authorities. In addition, numerous other state laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of individually identifiable health and healthcare provider information.
Our compliance efforts include the encryption of protected health information that we hold and the development of procedures to detect, investigate and provide appropriate notification if protected health information is compromised. Our employees and contractors receive initial and periodic supplemental training and are tested to ensure compliance. Additionally, we undergo regular privacy and security audits by our federal and commercial clients, as well as by third party auditors to maintain our HITRUST certification.
Privacy Act of 1974
The Privacy Act of 1974 governs the collection, use, storage, destruction and disclosure of personal information about individuals by a government agency and extends to government contractors who have access to agency records performing services for government agencies. The Privacy Act requires maintenance of a code of conduct for employees with access to the agency records addressing the obligations under the Privacy Act, training of employees and discipline procedures for noncompliance. The Privacy Act also requires adopting and maintaining appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity.
As a contractor to federal government agencies we are required to comply with the Privacy Act of 1974. Our compliance effort includes initial and ongoing training of employees and contractors in their obligations under the Privacy Act. In addition, we have implemented and maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards and processes intended to protect all personal data consistent with or exceeding our obligations under the Privacy Act.
FDCPA and Related Laws
The FDCPA regulates persons who regularly collect or attempt to collect, directly or indirectly, consumer debts owed or asserted to be owed to another person. Certain of our debt recovery and loan restructuring activities may be subject to the FDCPA. The FDCPA establishes specific guidelines and procedures that debt recovery firms must follow in communicating with consumer debtors, including the time, place and manner of such communications. Further, it prohibits harassment or abuse by debt recovery firms, including the threat of violence or criminal prosecution, obscene language or repeated telephone calls made with the intent to abuse or harass. The FDCPA also places restrictions on communications with individuals other than consumer debtors in connection with the collection of any consumer debt and sets forth specific procedures to be followed when communicating with such third parties for purposes of obtaining location information about the consumer. In addition, the FDCPA contains various notice and disclosure requirements and prohibits unfair or misleading representations by debt recovery firms. Finally, the FDCPA imposes certain limitations on lawsuits to collect debts against consumers.
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, primary jurisdiction for the FDCPA belongs to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB. The CFPB has authority to supervise, enforce, and issue interpretative regulations for the FDCPA. The CFPB has issued Regulation F, which went into effect November 30, 2021.
Debt recovery activities are also regulated at the state level. Most states have laws regulating debt recovery activities in ways that are similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, the FDCPA. In addition, some states require debt recovery firms to be licensed.
Our compliance efforts include written procedures for compliance with the FDCPA and related state laws, employee training and monitoring, auditing client calls, periodic review, testing and retraining of employees, and procedures for responding to client complaints. We believe we hold the applicable state licenses in all states in which we perform consumer collections. Violations of the FDCPA may be enforced by the CFPB or the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, or by a private action by an individual or class. Violations of the FDCPA are deemed to be an unfair, deceptive, or abusive under the Federal Trade Commission Act or the Dodd-Frank Act, which can be punished by fines for each violation. Class action damages can total up to one percent of the net worth of the entity violating the statute. Attorney fees and costs are also recoverable. In the ordinary course of business, we are sued for alleged violations of the FDCPA and comparable state laws, although the amounts involved in the disposition or settlement of any such claims have not been significant.
TCPA
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, regulates the initiation of calls (which includes text messages) to residential or cellular telephones, including the use of automatic telephone dialing systems as well as artificial or prerecorded voices. The TCPA requires callers to obtain prior express consent or, in some cases, prior express written consent from individuals before placing restricted calls. Our compliance efforts include confirming a consumer has provided prior express consent consistent with the requirements of the law. Violations of the TCPA may be enforced by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, or by a private action by an individual or class. Violations of the TCPA can be punished by recovery of damages or penalties up to $1,500 per violation for willful violations. Attorney fees and costs are also recoverable. In the ordinary course of business, we are sued for alleged violations of the TCPA and comparable state laws, although the amounts involved in the disposition or settlement of any such claims have not been significant.
FCRA
We are also subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, which regulates consumer credit reporting and which may impose liability on us to the extent that the adverse credit information reported on a consumer to a credit bureau is false or inaccurate. State law, to the extent it is not preempted by the FCRA, may also impose restrictions or liability on us with respect to reporting adverse credit information. Our compliance efforts include initial and ongoing training of employees working with consumer credit reports and the monitoring of usage. Violations of FCRA, which are deemed to be unfair or deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act, are enforced by the FTC or by a private action by an individual or class. Civil actions by consumers may seek damages per violation, with punitive damages, attorney's fees and costs also recoverable. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act or Dodd-Frank Act, penalties for engaging in unfair or deceptive acts may be levied in the form of fines for each violation.
CFPB
The CFPB was created as part of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2011, with primary implementing and interpretative authority for many federal consumer protection laws, for example the FDCPA, transferred to the CFPB. Among other things, the CFPB was given the authority to issue interpretive regulations for the FDCPA.
In addition to its authority regarding federal consumer protection laws, the CFPB was also provided direct jurisdiction over certain non-bank financial service products and service markets. In October of 2012, the CFPB issued a rule asserting direct jurisdiction over larger participants in certain consumer financial products and service markets, which includes consumer debt collectors with annual receipts of more than $10 million. In accordance with the calculations included in this rule, we are subject to direct jurisdiction of the CFPB and may be directly examined and supervised by the CFPB. In that regard, the CFPB has also released examination guidance that its examiners will use when reviewing compliance by debt collectors subject to its direct supervision.
The CFPB focuses on non-bank covered persons and service providers involved in collecting debt related to any consumer financial product from committing unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, or UDAAPs, in violation of the Dodd-Frank Act. UDAAPs include actions that are unfair and likely to cause substantial injury to consumers, deceptive actions that mislead or likely to mislead a consumer and abusive acts that interfere with the ability of a consumer to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or takes unreasonable advantage of a consumer’s lack of understanding of a consumer financial product. Although abusive acts or practices may also be unfair or deceptive, each of these prohibitions are separate and distinct, and are governed by separate legal standards. Original creditors and other covered persons and service providers involved in collecting debt related to any consumer financial product or service are subject to the prohibition against UDAAPs. The CFPB has indicated that it will continue to review closely the practices of those engaged in the collection of consumer debts for potential UDAAPs in violation of the Dodd-Frank Act.
State Laws
Many states impose an obligation on any entity that holds personally identifiable information or health information to adopt appropriate security to protect such data against unauthorized access, misuse, destruction, or modification. All fifty states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws requiring holders of personal information to take certain actions in response to data breach incidents, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and government authorities, and in some cases offering credit monitoring services. 
Certification, Accreditation, and Security
Business services that collect, store, transmit or process information for United States government agencies and organizations are required to undergo a rigorous certification and accreditation process to ensure that they operate at an acceptable level of security risk. As a government contractor, we currently have Authorization to Operate, or ATO, licenses for CMS Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) Regions 1 & 5 and HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG).
