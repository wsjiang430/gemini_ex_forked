Natural Gas — Natural gas supplies, transportation and storage services for power plants are procured to provide an adequate supply of fuel. Remaining requirements are procured through a liquid spot market. Generally, natural gas supply contracts have variable pricing that is tied to natural gas indices. Natural gas supply and transportation agreements include obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes or payments in lieu of delivery.
Contracts and commitments at Dec. 31:

 | NSP System | | PSCo | | SPS 
(Millions of Dollars) | Gas Supply | | Gas Transportation and Storage (a) | | Gas Supply (b) | | Gas Transportation and Storage (a) | Gas Supply | | Gas Transportation and Storage (a)
2018 | $ | — | | | $ | 406 | | $ | 412 | | | $ | 589 | | $ | 20 | $ | 152
2017 | — | | | 398 | | | 545 | | 620 | | | 11 | | 191 |

(a) | For incremental supplies, there are limited on-site fuel storage facilities, with a primary reliance on the spot market.


(b) | Majority of natural gas supply under contract is covered by a long-term agreement with Anadarko Energy Services Company and the balance of natural gas supply contracts have variable pricing features tied to changes in various natural gas indices. PSCo hedges a portion of that risk through financial instruments. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

Nuclear — NSP-Minnesota secures contracts for uranium concentrates, uranium conversion, uranium enrichment and fuel fabrication to operate its nuclear plants. The contract strategy involves a portfolio of spot purchases and medium and long-term contracts for uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services with multiple producers and with a focus on diversification to minimize potential impacts caused by supply interruptions due to geographical and world political issues.

• | Current nuclear fuel supply contracts cover 100% of uranium concentrates requirements through 2021 and approximately 51% of the requirements for 2022 - 2033.


• | Current contracts for conversion services cover 100% of the requirements through 2021 and approximately 43% of the requirements for 2022 - 2033.


• | Current enrichment service contracts cover 100% of the requirements through 2025 and approximately 19% of the requirements for 2026 - 2033.

Fabrication services for Monticello and PI are 100% committed through 2030 and 2027, respectively. 
NSP-Minnesota expects sufficient uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services to be available for the requirements of its nuclear generating plants. Some exposure to market price volatility will remain due to index-based pricing structures contained in supply contracts.

• | Infrastructure rider — Recovers costs for investments in generation and incremental property taxes in South Dakota.


NSP-Minnesota’s retail electric rates in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota include a FCA for monthly billing adjustments to recover changes in prudently incurred costs of fuel related items and purchased energy. Capacity costs are recovered through base rates and are not recovered through the FCA. Costs associated with MISO are generally recovered through either the FCA or base rates.
In 2017, the MPUC voted to change the FCA process in Minnesota. Under the new process, each month utilities would collect amounts equal to the baseline cost of energy set at the start of the plan year (base would be reset annually). Monthly variations to the baseline costs would be tracked and netted over a 12-month period. Utilities would issue refunds above the baseline costs, and could seek recovery of any overage. Recently, the MPUC delayed implementation until January 2020.
Minnesota state law requires NSP-Minnesota to invest 2% of its state electric revenues and 0.5% of its state gas revenues in CIP. These costs are recovered through an annual cost-recovery mechanism for electric conservation and energy management program expenditures.
Energy Sources and Transmission Service Provider
NSP-Minnesota expects to use power plants, power purchases, CIP/DSM options, new generation facilities and expansion of power plants to meet its system capacity requirements.
Purchased Power — NSP-Minnesota has contracts to purchase power from other utilities and IPPs. Long-term purchased power contracts for dispatchable resources typically require a capacity charge and an energy charge. NSP-Minnesota makes short-term purchases to meet system requirements, replace company owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations or obtain energy at a lower cost. 
Purchased Transmission Services — NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have contracts with MISO and other regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to their customers.
Wind Development — In 2017, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota’s proposal to add 1,550 MW of new wind generation including ownership of 1,150 MW of wind generation.
In April 2018, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota’s petition to build and own the Dakota Range, a 300 MW wind project in South Dakota. NSP-Minnesota’s capital investment for the Dakota Range is expected to be approximately $350 million and placed in service in 2021.
In December 2018, the NDPSC approved a settlement agreement for these wind development projects.
PPA Terminations and Amendments — In June 2018, NSP-Minnesota terminated the Benson and Laurentian PPAs, and purchased the Benson biomass facility. As a result, a $103 million regulatory asset was recognized for the costs of the Benson transaction. For Laurentian, a regulatory asset of $109 million was recognized for annual termination payments/obligations. Regulatory approvals provide for recovery of the Benson regulatory asset over 10 years and Laurentian termination payments as they occur (over six years). Termination of the PPAs is expected to save customers over $600 million throughout the next 10 years.

Jurisdictional Cost Recovery Allocation — In December 2016, NSP-Minnesota filed a resource treatment framework with the NDPSC and MPUC. The filing proposed a framework to allow NSP-Minnesota’s operations in North Dakota and Minnesota to gradually become more independent of one another with respect to future generation resource selection while also identifying a path for cost sharing of current resources. NSP-Minnesota’s filing identified two options: a legal separation, creating a separate North Dakota operating company; or a pseudo-separation, which maintains the current corporate structure but directly assigns the costs and benefits of each resource to the jurisdiction that supports it. Docket remains under consideration by the NDPSC.
Minnesota State ROFR Statute Complaint — In September 2017, LSP Transmission filed a complaint in the Minnesota District Court against the Minnesota Attorney General, MPUC and DOC. The complaint was in response to MISO assigning NSP-Minnesota and ITC Midwest, LLC to jointly own a new 345 KV transmission line from near Mankato, Minnesota to Winnebago, Minnesota. The project was estimated by MISO to cost $108 million and was assigned to NSP-Minnesota and ITC Midwest as the incumbent utilities, consistent with a Minnesota state ROFR statute. The complaint challenged the constitutionality of the state ROFR statute and is seeking declaratory judgment that the statute violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution and should not be enforced. The Minnesota state agencies and NSP-Minnesota filed motions to dismiss. In June 2018, the Minnesota District Court granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss with prejudice. LSP Transmission filed an appeal in July 2018. It is uncertain when a decision will be rendered.
Nuclear Power Operations and Waste Disposal
NSP-Minnesota owns two nuclear generating plants: the Monticello plant and the PI plant. Nuclear power plant operations produce gaseous, liquid and solid radioactive wastes which are controlled by federal regulation. High-level radioactive wastes primarily include used nuclear fuel. LLW consists primarily of demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing, rags, tools and equipment that have become contaminated through use in a plant.
NRC Regulation — The NRC regulates nuclear operations. Costs of complying with NRC requirements can affect both operating expenses and capital investments of the plants. NSP-Minnesota has obtained recovery of these compliance costs in customer rates and expects future compliance costs will continue to be recoverable.
LLW Disposal — LLW from NSP-Minnesota’s Monticello and PI nuclear plants is currently disposed at the Clive facility located in Utah and the Waste Control Specialists facility located in Texas. If off-site LLW disposal facilities become unavailable, NSP-Minnesota has storage capacity available on-site at PI and Monticello which would allow both plants to continue to operate until the end of their current licensed lives.
High-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal — The federal government has responsibility to permanently dispose domestic spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive wastes. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires the DOE to implement a program for nuclear high-level waste management. This includes the siting, licensing, construction and operation of a repository for spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear power reactors and other high-level radioactive wastes at a permanent federal storage or disposal facility. The federal government has been evaluating a nuclear geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada for many years. Currently, there are no definitive plans for a permanent federal storage facility at Yucca Mountain or any other site.


Review of PI Costs — As part of NSP-Minnesota’s 2016 multi-year electric rate case and IRP, the MPUC ordered an investigation into NSP-Minnesota’s PI nuclear investments. The issue was resolved as part of the 2016 multi-year electric rate case settlement. In November 2018, the DOC issued a final report, in which no cost disallowances were recommended.
Nuclear Spent Fuel Storage — NSP-Minnesota has interim on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel at its Monticello and PI nuclear generating plants. Authorized storage capacity is sufficient to allow NSP-Minnesota to operate until the end of the operating licenses in 2030 for Monticello, 2033 for PI Unit 1, and 2034 for PI Unit 2. Authorizations for additional spent fuel storage capacity may be required at each site to support either continued operation or decommissioning if the federal government does not commence storage operations.
In 2013, NSP-Minnesota’s Monticello nuclear generating plant loaded and placed five storage canisters (canisters #11-15) in the ISFSI and a sixth canister (canister #16) was loaded but remained in the plant pending resolution of weld inspection issues. Successful pressure and leak testing demonstrated the safety and integrity of all six canisters involved. NSP-Minnesota took several actions to assure compliance with the NRC’s regulations and Monticello’s storage license. The NRC has approved NSP-Minnesota’s compliance plan for all canisters. 
NSP-Minnesota intends to seek recovery of these costs in a future regulatory proceeding. No public safety issues have been raised, or are believed to exist, in this matter.
See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations
NSP-Minnesota conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, ancillary services and energy-related products. NSP-Minnesota uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price and credit risk and hedge sales and purchases. NSP-Minnesota also engages in trading activity unrelated to hedging and sharing of any margins is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved JOA. NSP-Minnesota does not serve any wholesale requirements customers at cost-based regulated rates.
NSP-Wisconsin
Public Utility Regulation
Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction — Retail rates, services and other aspects of NSP-Wisconsin’s operations are regulated by the PSCW and the MPSC. In addition, each of the state commissions certifies the need for new generating plants and electric transmission lines before the facilities may be sited and built. NSP-Wisconsin is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC for its wholesale electric operations, hydroelectric generation licensing, accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale, transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance with NERC electric reliability standards, asset transactions and mergers and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce. NSP-Wisconsin is a transmission owning member of the MISO RTO that operates within the MISO RTO and wholesale energy market. NSP-Wisconsin and NSP-Minnesota are jointly authorized by the FERC to make wholesale electric sales at market-based prices. 
The PSCW has a biennial base rate filing requirement. By June of each odd numbered year, NSP-Wisconsin must submit a rate filing for the test year beginning the following January.

Fuel and Purchased Energy Cost Recovery Mechanisms — NSP-Wisconsin does not have an automatic electric fuel adjustment clause. Instead, under Wisconsin rules, utilities submit a forward-looking annual fuel cost plan to the PSCW. Once the PSCW approves the fuel cost plan, utilities defer the amount of any fuel cost under-recovery or over-recovery in excess of a 2% annual tolerance band, for future rate recovery or refund. Approval of a fuel cost plan and any rate adjustment for refund or recovery of deferred costs is determined by the PSCW. Rate recovery of deferred fuel cost is subject to an earnings test based on the utility’s most recently authorized ROE. Fuel cost under-collections that exceed the 2% annual tolerance band may not be recovered if the utility earnings for that year exceed the authorized ROE.
NSP-Wisconsin’s electric fuel costs for 2018 were lower than authorized in rates and outside the 2% annual tolerance band, primarily due to greater than forecasted generation sales into the MISO market and lower purchased power costs coupled with moderate weather. Under the fuel cost recovery rules, NSP-Wisconsin retained approximately $3.6 million of fuel costs and deferred approximately $2.8 million. NSP-Wisconsin will file a reconciliation of 2018 fuel costs with the PSCW by March 31, 2019. 
NSP-Wisconsin’s retail electric rate schedules for Michigan customers include power supply cost recovery factors, which are based on 12-month projections. After each 12-month period, a reconciliation is submitted whereby over-recoveries are refunded and any under-recoveries are collected from customers.
Wisconsin Energy Efficiency Program — The primary energy efficiency program is funded by the state’s utilities, but operated by independent contractors subject to oversight by the PSCW and utilities. NSP-Wisconsin recovers these costs from retail customers.
Transmission Initiatives
NSP-Wisconsin operates an integrated system with NSP-Minnesota. See NSP-Minnesota-Energy Sources and Transmission Service Provider.
NSP-Wisconsin / American Transmission Company, LLC - La Crosse to Madison, WI Transmission Line — In December 2018, construction was completed on the Badger Coulee 345 KV transmission line. The line extends from La Crosse, WI. to Madison, WI. NSP-Wisconsin’s half of the line is shared with Dairyland Power Cooperative, WPPI Energy and Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency-Wisconsin.
Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations
NSP-Wisconsin does not serve any wholesale requirements customers at cost-based regulated rates. 
PSCo

Energy Sources and Transmission Service Providers
PSCo expects to meet its system capacity requirements through electric generating stations, power purchases, new generation facilities, DSM options and expansion of generation plants.
Purchased Power — PSCo purchases power from other utilities and IPPs. Long-term purchased power contracts for dispatchable resources typically require capacity and energy charges. It also contracts to purchase power for both wind and solar resources. PSCo makes short-term purchases to meet system load and energy requirements, replace owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations, or obtain energy at a lower cost.
Purchased Transmission Services — In addition to using its own transmission system, PSCo has contracts with regional transmission service providers to deliver energy to its customers.
Wind Development — In 2018, PSCo completed construction and placed in service its Rush Creek 600 MW wind farm in Colorado.
CEP — In September 2018, the CPUC approved PSCo’s preferred CEP portfolio, which included the retirement of two coal-fired generation units, Comanche Unit 1 (in 2022) and Comanche Unit 2 (in 2025), and the following additions:

 | Total Capacity | PSCo's Ownership
Wind generation | 1,100 MW | 500 MW 
Solar generation | 700 MW | — 
Battery storage | 275 MW | — 
Natural gas generation | 380 MW | 380 MW 

PSCo’s investment is expected to be approximately $1 billion, including transmission to support the increase in renewable generation. This investment includes the 500 MW Cheyenne Ridge wind farm and 345 KV generation tie line, as well as the Shortgrass Substation. CPCNs for these projects were filed in December 2018. A CPUC decision is anticipated by May 2019. CPCNs for the natural gas generation facility are anticipated to be filed by mid-2019.

Boulder Municipalization — In 2011, Boulder passed a ballot measure authorizing the formation of an electric municipal utility, subject to certain conditions. Subsequently, there have been various legal proceedings in multiple venues with jurisdiction over Boulder’s plan. In 2014, the Boulder City Council passed an ordinance to establish an electric utility. PSCo challenged the formation of this utility and the Colorado Court of Appeals ruled in PSCo’s favor, vacating a lower court decision. In June 2018, the Colorado Supreme court rejected Boulder’s request to dismiss the case and remanded it to the Boulder District Court.
Boulder has filed multiple separation applications with the CPUC, which have been challenged by PSCo and other intervenors. In September 2017, the CPUC issued a written decision, agreeing with several key aspects of PSCo’s position. The CPUC has approved the designation of some electrical distribution assets for transfer, subject to Boulder completing certain filings. Those filings were submitted in the fourth quarter of 2018. Subsequently, various parties requested the CPUC commence additional processes; the form of such processes is currently under consideration. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Boulder’s City Council also adopted an Ordinance authorizing Boulder to begin negotiations for the acquisition of certain property or to otherwise condemn that property after Feb. 1, 2019. In the first quarter of 2019, Boulder sent PSCo a Notice of Intent to acquire certain electric distribution assets. 
Boulder does not have authorization from the CPUC to initiate a condemnation proceeding at this time.
Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations
PSCo conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, ancillary services and energy related products. PSCo uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price and credit risk and hedge sales and purchases. PSCo also engages in trading activity unrelated to hedging and sharing of any margins is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved JOA.
SPS
Public Utility Regulation
Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction — The PUCT and NMPRC regulate SPS’ retail electric operations and have jurisdiction over its retail rates and services and the construction of transmission or generation in their respective states. The municipalities in which SPS operates in Texas have original jurisdiction over SPS’ rates in those communities. The municipalities’ rate setting decisions are subject to PUCT review.
SPS is regulated by the FERC for its wholesale electric operations, accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale, the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance with NERC electric reliability standards, asset transactions and mergers, and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce. SPS is a transmission-owning member of the SPP RTO and operates within the SPP RTO and SPP IM wholesale market. SPS is authorized to make wholesale electric sales at market-based prices. 
Fuel, Purchased Energy and Conservation Cost-Recovery 
Mechanisms — 

• | DCRF — Recovers distribution costs not included in rates in Texas.


• | EECRF — Recovers costs for energy efficiency programs in Texas.


• | EE rider — Recovers costs for energy efficiency programs in New Mexico.


• | FPPCAC — Adjusts monthly to recover the actual fuel and purchased power costs in New Mexico.


• | PCRF — Allows recovery of purchased power costs not included in rates in Texas.


• | RPS — Recovers deferred costs for renewable energy programs in New Mexico.


• | TCRF — Recovers certain transmission infrastructure improvement costs and changes in wholesale transmission charges not included in base rates in Texas.

The fixed fuel and purchased energy recovery factor provides for the over- or under-recovery of energy expenses. Regulations require refunding or surcharging over- or under- recovery amounts, including interest, when they exceed 4% of the utility’s annual fuel and purchased energy costs on a rolling 12-month basis, if this condition is expected to continue.
SPS recovers fuel and purchased energy costs from its wholesale customers through a monthly wholesale fuel and purchased energy cost adjustment clause accepted by the FERC. Wholesale customers also pay the jurisdictional allocation of production costs.
Energy Sources and Transmission Service Providers
SPS expects to use electric generating stations, power purchases, DSM and new generation options to meet its system capacity requirements. In addition, it has evaluated water supply issues at the Tolk facility, concluding additional resource investment will be required to operate the plant through its existing life. The Ogallala aquifer has depleted more rapidly than expected. SPS installed a horizontal water well that may help delay the need for a more substantial investment solution. As a result of this issue and future environmental rules facing the plant, it sought a decrease to the remaining life of the facility in the 2017 Texas and New Mexico rate case proceedings.
Purchased Power — SPS purchases power from other utilities and IPPs. Long-term purchased power contracts typically require periodic capacity and energy charges. SPS also makes short-term purchases to meet system load and energy requirements to replace owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations or obtain energy at a lower cost.
Purchased Transmission Services — SPS has contractual arrangements with SPP and regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to its native load customers.
Wind Development — In 2018, the NMPRC and PUCT approved SPS’ proposal to add 1,230 MW of new wind generation, including 1,000 MW ownership.
In March 2018, the NMPRC approved SPS’ petition to build and own Sagamore, a 522 MW wind project in New Mexico which is expected to be placed into service in 2020. In May 2018, the PUCT approved SPS’ petition to build and own Hale County, a 478 MW wind project in Texas which is expected to be placed into service in 2019. Both projects qualify for 100% of PTCs. SPS’ capital investment for these wind projects is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion.
Texas State ROFR Request for Declaratory Order — In 2017, SPS and SPP filed a joint petition with the PUCT for a declaratory order regarding SPS’ ROFR. SPS contended that Texas law grants an incumbent electric utility the ROFR to construct new transmission facilities located in the utility’s service area. The PUCT subsequently issued an order finding that SPS does not possess an exclusive right to construct and operate transmission facilities. In January 2018, SPS and two other parties filed appeals in the Texas State District Court. In September 2018, the District Court affirmed the PUCT’s ROFR order. SPS has filed an additional appeal.

• | DSMCA — Recovers costs of DSM and performance initiatives to achieve various energy savings goals.


• | PSIA — Recovers costs for transmission and distribution pipeline integrity management programs.

SPS
Natural Gas Facilities Used for Electric Generation
SPS does not provide retail natural gas service, but purchases and transports natural gas for its generation facilities and operates natural gas pipeline facilities connecting the generation facilities to interstate natural gas pipelines. SPS is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC with respect to natural gas transactions in interstate commerce and the PHMSA and PUCT for pipeline safety compliance.
GENERAL
Seasonality
Demand for electric power and natural gas is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. In general, peak sales of electricity occur in the summer months and peak sales of natural gas occur in the winter months. As a result, the overall operating results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Additionally, Xcel Energy’s operations have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. 
See Item 7 for further information.
Competition
Xcel Energy is a vertically integrated utility subject to traditional cost-of-service regulation by state public utilities commissions. Xcel Energy is subject to public policies that promote competition and development of energy markets. Xcel Energy’s industrial and large commercial customers have the ability to generate their own electricity. In addition, customers may have the option of substituting other fuels or relocating their facilities to a lower cost region. 


16

Customers have the opportunity to supply their own power with distributed generation including, but not limited to, solar generation and in most jurisdictions can currently avoid paying for most of the fixed production, transmission and distribution costs incurred to serve them. Several states have policies designed to promote the development of solar and other distributed energy resources through incentive policies. With these incentives and federal tax subsidies, distributed generating resources are potential competitors to Xcel Energy’s electric service business.
The FERC has continued to promote competitive wholesale markets through open access transmission and other means. As a result, Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries and their wholesale customers can purchase the output from generation resources of competing wholesale suppliers and use the transmission systems of the utility subsidiaries on a comparable basis to serve their native load.
FERC Order No. 1000 seeks to establish competition for construction and operation of certain new electric transmission facilities. State utilities commissions have also created resource planning programs that promote competition for electricity generation resources used to provide service to retail customers. 
Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries have franchise agreements with cities subject to periodic renewal, however, a city could seek alternative means to access electric power or gas, such as municipalization. 
While each of Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries faces these challenges, Xcel Energy believes their rates and services are competitive with the alternatives currently available.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Xcel Energy’s facilities are regulated by federal and state environmental agencies that have jurisdiction over air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid wastes and hazardous substances. Various company activities require registrations, permits, licenses, inspections and approvals from these agencies. Xcel Energy has received all necessary authorizations for the construction and continued operation of its generation, transmission and distribution systems. Xcel Energy’s facilities have been designed and constructed to operate in compliance with applicable environmental standards and related monitoring and reporting requirements. However, it is not possible to determine when or to what extent additional facilities or modifications of existing or planned facilities will be required as a result of changes to environmental regulations, interpretations or enforcement policies or what effect future laws or regulations may have upon Xcel Energy’s operations. Xcel Energy will likely be required to incur capital expenditures in the future to comply with requirements for remediation of MGP and other legacy sites. The scope and timing of these expenditures cannot be determined until more information is obtained regarding the need for remediation at legacy sites. 
In Minnesota, Texas and Wisconsin, Xcel Energy must comply with emission budgets that require the purchase of emission allowances from other utilities. The Denver North Front Range Nonattainment Area does not meet either the 2008 or 2015 ozone NAAQS. Colorado will continue to consider further reductions available in the non-attainment area as it develops plans to meet ozone standards. Gas plants which operate in PSCo’s non-attainment area may be required to improve or add controls, implement further work practices and/or implement enhanced emissions monitoring as part of future Colorado state plans.


There are significant present and future environmental regulations to encourage use of clean energy technologies and regulate emissions of GHGs. Xcel Energy has undertaken numerous initiatives to meet current requirements and prepare for potential future regulations, reduce GHG emissions and respond to state renewable and energy efficiency goals. If future environmental regulations do not provide credit for the investments Xcel Energy has already made or if they require additional initiatives or emission reductions, substantial costs may be incurred. The EPA, as an alternative to the CPP, has proposed a new regulation that, if adopted, would require implementation of heat rate improvement projects at our coal-fired power plants. It is not known what those costs might be until a final rule is adopted and state plans are developed to implement a final regulation. Xcel Energy believes, based on prior state commission practice, the cost of these initiatives or replacement generation would be recoverable through rates.
Xcel Energy is committed to addressing climate change and potential climate change regulation through efforts to reduce its GHG emissions in a balanced, cost-effective manner. Starting in 2011, Xcel Energy began reporting GHG emissions under the EPA’s mandatory GHG Reporting Program.
Xcel Energy estimates that in 2018, it reduced the CO2 emissions associated with the electric generating resources used to serve its customers by approximately 40% from 2005 levels. This reduction accounts for emissions from electric generating plants owned by Xcel Energy as well as purchased power. 
Xcel Energy primarily relied on strategies that resulted in:

• | Development of renewable energy facilities;


• | Retirement and replacement of existing generating plants; and,


• | Customer energy efficiency programs.
