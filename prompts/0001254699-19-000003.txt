Item 1. Business
Overview
QVC, Inc. and its subsidiaries (unless otherwise indicated or required by the context, the terms "we," "our," "us," the "Company," and "QVC" refer to QVC, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries) includes the reportable segments of QVC-U.S. and QVC-International (combined referred to as "QVC-Global", which does not constitute a separate reportable segment) as well as HSN, Inc. ("HSN"), which became a subsidiary of QVC as of December 31, 2018 as explained in more detail below. 
QVC curates and sells a wide variety of consumer products via highly engaging, video-rich, interactive shopping experiences, distributed to approximately 404 million worldwide households each day (including our joint venture in China as discussed below in further detail) through our broadcast networks as well as our over-the-top platforms (such as Apple TV, Roku and others), our websites (including QVC.com, HSN.com and others), our mobile applications and our social pages. We believe we are the global leader in video retailing, e-commerce, mobile commerce and social commerce, with operations based in the United States ("U.S."), Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom ("U.K."), Italy and France. Additionally, we have a 49% interest in a retailing joint venture in China, which operates through a television shopping channel with an associated website. The joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment. Our operating strategy is to create premier shopping destinations for our customers across multiple broadcast, digital and emerging platforms (featuring fresh, relevant and compelling product selections and programming), further penetrate our core customer base, generate new customers and expand internationally to drive revenue and profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 93% of QVC's worldwide shipped sales were from repeat and reactivated customers (i.e., customers who made a purchase from us during the prior twelve months and customers who previously made a purchase from us but not during the prior twelve months). In the same period, QVC attracted approximately 4.4 million new customers and the global e-commerce operation comprised $5.8 billion, or 51%, of QVC's consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.
In the U.S., QVC distributes programming live 24 hours per day, 364 days per year. QVC-U.S. and HSN present on average 783 and 633 products, respectively, every week. Internationally, we distribute live programming 8 to 24 hours per day, depending on the market. We classify our products into six groups: home, beauty, apparel, jewelry, accessories and electronics. It is our product sourcing team's mission to research and locate compelling and differentiated products from manufacturers who have sufficient scale to meet anticipated demand. We offer many exclusive products, as well as popular brand name and lesser known products available from other retailers. Many of our products are endorsed by celebrities, designers and other well-known personalities who often join our presenters on our live programming and provide lead-in publicity on their own social pages, websites and other customer touchpoints. We believe that our ability to demonstrate product features and present “faces and places” differentiates and defines the QVC shopping experience. We closely monitor customer demand and our product mix to remain well-positioned and relevant in popular and growing retail segments, which we believe is a significant competitive advantage relative to competitors who operate brick-and-mortar stores.
In 2018, QVC-U.S. and HSN have shipped over 90.5 million and 25.3 million packages, respectively. We operate fifteen distribution centers and eight call centers worldwide. In 2018, QVC's work force consisted of approximately 21,400 employees who handled approximately 171 million customer calls, shipped approximately 235 million units globally and served approximately 15.5 million unique customers. We believe our long-term relationships with major U.S. television distributors, including cable operators (e.g., Comcast and Cox), satellite television providers (e.g., DISH Network and DIRECTV) and telecommunications companies (e.g., Verizon and AT&T), provide us with broad distribution, favorable channel positioning and significant competitive advantages. We believe that our significant market share, brand awareness, outstanding customer service, repeat customer base, flexible payments options, international reach and scalable infrastructure distinguish us from our competitors.
History
QVC was founded on June 13, 1986 by Joseph Segel. Our first U.S. live broadcast took place at 7:30 PM ET on November 24 of that year, reaching 7.6 million homes. Initially broadcast live from 7:30 PM ET until midnight each weekday and all day Saturdays and Sundays, the channel extended its live U.S. programming to 24 hours per day in January 1987.
In 1995, Comcast purchased a majority shareholding in QVC, taking control of the Company. In 2003, Comcast sold its majority share to Qurate Retail, Inc. ("Qurate Retail") (formerly known as Liberty Interactive Corporation).
I-1

HSN's predecessor company began broadcasting television home shopping programming from its studios in St. Petersburg, Florida in 1981 and, by 1985, was broadcasting its programming through a national network of cable and local television stations 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
On December 29, 2017, Qurate Retail completed the acquisition of the remaining 62% ownership interest of HSN it did not previously own in an all-stock transaction. On December 31, 2018, Qurate Retail transferred its 100% ownership interest in HSN to QVC through a transaction among entities under common control. As a result of the transaction, QVC has presented the operations and financial position of HSN in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of December 29, 2017. 
Please see "QVC-U.S.","QVC-International" and "HSN" below for information on the development of our businesses.
Operating segments
QVC has three reportable segments: QVC-U.S., QVC-International and HSN. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. For financial information about our operating segments, please refer to note 16 of our accompanying consolidated financial statements, as well as to Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
QVC-U.S.
QVC-U.S.'s live programming is distributed nationally, 24 hours per day, 364 days per year, to approximately 96 million television households and distributes our programming to approximately 99% of households subscribing to services offered by television distributors. QVC-U.S. programming is also available on QVC.com, our U.S. website; mobile applications via streaming video; over-the-air broadcasters in 100 markets; and on Facebook Live, Roku, Apple TV, and Amazon Fire platforms. QVC-U.S., including QVC.com, contributed $6.3 billion, or 56%, of consolidated net revenue, $1,112 million of operating income and $1,417 million of Adjusted OIBDA (defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2018.
QVC-U.S. also has over-the-air broadcasting in designated U.S. markets that can be accessed by any household with a digital antenna in such markets, regardless of whether it subscribes to a paid television service. This allows QVC-U.S. to reach customers who previously did not have access to the program through other television platforms. QVC-U.S. launched an additional channel, QVC2, which is being distributed through cable and satellite systems and on QVC's digital platforms. QVC2 offers viewers access to a broader range of QVC programming options as well as more relevant programming for viewers in differing time zones. In October 2016, QVC-U.S. launched a third channel, Beauty iQ, which is being distributed through cable, satellite, streaming and digital platforms. The channel and supporting platforms are primarily dedicated to a complete beauty shopping experience for customers.
QVC.com enables consumers to purchase goods offered on our broadcast programming along with a wide assortment of products that are available only on QVC.com. QVC.com and other digital platforms (including our mobile apps, our social pages and others) are natural extensions of our business model, allowing customers to engage in our shopping experience wherever they are, with live or on-demand content customized to the device they are using. In addition, QVC.com allows shoppers to browse, research, compare and perform targeted searches for products, read customer reviews, control the order-entry process and conveniently access their QVC account. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 84% of our new QVC-U.S. customers made their first purchase through QVC.com (including through our mobile application).
The table below illustrates QVC.com's growth (including mobile) since 2016:
 | Years ended December 31, | 
(in millions) | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
QVC.com net revenue | $ | 3,673 | | $ | 3,421 | | $ | 3,193

QVC-International
Our international business brings the QVC shopping experience to approximately 145 million households outside the U.S., primarily in Germany, Austria, Japan, the U.K., the Republic of Ireland, Italy and France. In addition, our joint venture in China reaches approximately 163 million homes. Similar to the U.S. business, our international business engages customers via multiple platforms, including broadcast networks, websites, mobile applications and social pages. Our international product sourcing teams select products tailored to the interests of each local market. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our international operations generated $2.7 billion, or 24%, of consolidated net revenue, $351 million of operating income and $429 million of Adjusted OIBDA (defined below), and our international websites generated $1,051 million, or 38%, of our total international net revenue.
QVC-Germany. QVC-Germany went on air in December 1996 and currently broadcasts 17 hours of live programming each day and reaches approximately 42 million households that are located in both Germany and Austria. Beyond the main channel, QVC-Germany also broadcasts shows on two additional channels, QVC Style and QVC2, which provides a broader range of programming options, along with an e-commerce website, a mobile application and social pages. 
QVC-Japan. We own 60% of QVC-Japan through a venture with Mitsui & Co., LTD. QVC-Japan launched in April 2001 and currently broadcasts 24 hours of live programming each day and reaches approximately 28 million households. QVC-Japan also operates an e-commerce website, mobile applications and social pages. In 2014, QVC-Japan launched Q-plus, which consists of infomercial programming distributed by purchasing available airtime on certain channels. On December 1, 2018, QVC-Japan launched 4K high dynamic range broadcasting ("HDR"), making QVC-Japan the first network in Japan to broadcast native, full-scale 4K HDR programming 24 hours a day. 
QVC-U.K. QVC-U.K. went on air in October 1993 and currently broadcasts 17 hours of live programming each day and reaches approximately 28 million households that are located in both the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. Beyond the main channel, QVC-U.K. also broadcasts shows on three additional channels, QVC Beauty, QVC Extra, and QVC Style, which provides a broader range of programming options, along with an e-commerce website, mobile applications and social pages. 
QVC-Italy. QVC-Italy went on air in October 2010 and currently reaches approximately 25 million households. QVC-Italy broadcasts live for 17 hours each day on satellite and digital terrestrial television, and broadcasts an additional seven hours each day of recorded programming on satellite and seven hours each day of general interest programming on digital terrestrial television. QVC-Italy also operates an e-commerce website, a mobile application and social pages.
QVC-France. In June 2015, QVC expanded its global presence into France, launching its website on June 23, 2015 followed by its broadcast network on August 1, 2015. QVC-France reaches approximately 22 million households. On weekdays, QVC-France distributes shopping programming live for eight hours per day. On weekends, QVC-France broadcasts live for 12 hours per day.
China Joint Venture. On July 4, 2012, we entered into a joint venture with Beijing-based CNR Media Group, formerly known as China Broadcasting Corporation, a limited liability company owned by China National Radio ("CNR"), China's government-owned radio division. The joint venture, CNR Home Shopping Co., Ltd. ("CNRS"), is owned 49% by QVC and 51% by CNR through subsidiaries of each company. CNRS operates a retailing business in China through a television shopping channel with an associated website. This joint venture combines CNRS's knowledge of the digital shopping market and consumers in China with QVC's global experience and know-how in multimedia retailing. CNRS distributes live programming for 10 hours each day and recorded programming for 14 hours each day. The CNRS joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment recorded as equity in losses of investee in our consolidated statements of operations.
HSN
HSN broadcasts live nationally, 24 hours per day, 364 days per year, reaching approximately 96 million homes in the U.S. HSN2, which debuted in August 2010, primarily distributes pre-recorded programming. HSN also operates an e-commerce website, a mobile application, social pages and innovative "Shop By Remote" technology. HSN, including HSN.com, contributed $2.2 billion or 20% of consolidated net revenue, $49 million of operating income and $213 million of Adjusted OIBDA (defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2018.
HSN.com allows customers to buy merchandise offered on the HSN broadcasts, along with a wide assortment of merchandise sold exclusively on HSN.com. HSN.com offers customers a content-rich experience, featuring live video, on-demand product and how-to videos and customer reviews. 
I-3

The table below illustrates HSN.com's growth (including mobile) since 2016:
 | Years ended December 31, | 
(in millions) | 2018 | | 2017 (1) | | 2016 (1) | 
HSN.com net revenue | $ | 1,075 | | $ | 1,099 | | $ | 1,119
Total HSN net revenue | 2,202 | | 2,343 | | 2,479 | 
HSN.com % of total HSN net revenue | 48.8 | % | 46.9 | % | 45.1 | %

(1) Net revenue for HSN for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are HSN's standalone results and are not included within the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted OIBDA")
QVC defines Adjusted OIBDA as net revenue less cost of goods sold, operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding transaction related costs and stock-based compensation). QVC's chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate the businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among the businesses. QVC believes that this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of the businesses, including the ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures. In addition, this measure allows QVC to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and perform benchmarking among its businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes such costs as impairment loss, depreciation, amortization, transaction related costs and stock-based compensation that are included in the measurement of operating income pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP"). Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The primary material limitations associated with the use of Adjusted OIBDA as compared to GAAP results are (i) it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in the industry, and (ii) it excludes financial information that some may consider important in evaluating QVC's performance. QVC compensates for these limitations by providing disclosure of the difference between Adjusted OIBDA and GAAP results, including providing a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to GAAP results, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of QVC's operating results. Refer to note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income before income taxes.
Merchandise
We believe that our ability to combine product and programming helps us create competitive advantages over traditional brick-and-mortar and Internet retailers. We seek to offer our customers an assortment of compelling, high-quality products. QVC- U.S. and HSN present on average 783 and 633 products, respectively, every week on our live programming, approximately 22% and 30%, respectively, of which have not been presented previously to our television audience. We offer customers high-quality and brand name products, presented in a creative, informative, entertaining and engaging style. We provide a differentiated shopping experience by offering customers the opportunity to experience not only the product being sold, but also the people and places behind that product, thereby enhancing their overall shopping experience.
Our global merchandise mix features: (i) home, (ii) apparel, (iii) beauty, (iv) accessories, (v) electronics and (vi) jewelry. Many of our brands are exclusive, while others are created by well-known designers. Our global sales mix is provided in the table below:

 | Years ended December 31, | 
Product category | 2018 | | 2017 (1) | | 2016 (1) | 
Home | 38 | % | 34 | % | 33 | %
Beauty | 18 | % | 17 | % | 17 | %

Total | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %

(1) Our global sales mix for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 does not include HSN.
Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar retailers with inventories across a network of stores, we are able to quickly adapt our offerings in direct response to changes in our customer's purchasing patterns. We utilize a test and re-order model to determine initial customer demand. Through constant monitoring, we manage our product offerings to maximize net revenue and fulfill current demand in large growth segments where we can gain a greater share of our customers' purchases. Our merchandising team is dedicated to continually researching, pursuing and launching new products and brands. With a mandate to deliver hard-to-find value, our merchants find and curate collections of high quality goods from manufacturers with the scale to offer sufficient supply to our existing and future customers. We maintain strong relationships with our vendors, which are attracted by the showcasing and story-telling elements of our programming, and the volume of sales during featured presentations. 
We purchase, or obtain on consignment, products from U.S. and foreign manufacturers and wholesalers, often on favorable terms based upon the volume of the transactions. We have attracted some of the world's most respected consumer brands as well as celebrities, entrepreneurs and designers to promote these brands. Brand leaders such as Dell, Dooney & Bourke, Dyson, Judith Ripka and Philosophy reach a broad audience while product representatives share the stories behind these brands. We have agreements with celebrities, entrepreneurs and designers such as Isaac Mizrahi, Rachael Ray and Martha Stewart enabling us to provide entertaining and engaging programming that develops a lifestyle bond with our customers. These celebrity personalities and product representatives often provide pre-appearance publicity for their QVC products on their own social pages and broadcast shows, enhancing demand during their QVC appearances. We present and promote across our networks, websites, mobile applications and social platforms, allowing shoppers to engage with us on multiple platforms and devices. 
We do not depend on any single supplier or designer for a significant portion of our inventory purchases.
Distribution
QVC distributes its programmings, via satellite and optical fiber, to cable television and direct-to-home satellite system operators for retransmission to its subscribers in the U.S., Germany, Japan, the U.K., Italy and neighboring countries. The Company also transmits its programmings over digital terrestrial broadcast television to viewers throughout Italy, Germany, and the U.K. and to viewers in certain geographic regions in the U.S. In the U.S., the Company uplinks its digital programming transmissions using a third party service or internal resources. The transmissions are uplinked to protected, non-preemptible transponders on U.S. satellites. "Protected" status means that, in the event of a transponder failure, QVC's signal will be transferred to a spare transponder or, if none is available, to a preemptible transponder located on the same satellite or, in certain cases, to a transponder on another satellite owned by the same service provider if one is available at the time of the failure. "Non-preemptible" status means that, in the event of a transponder failure, QVC's transponders cannot be preempted in favor of a user of a failed transponder, even another user with "protected status." The Company's international business units each obtain uplinking services from third parties and transmit their programming to non-preemptible transponders on international satellites and terrestrial transmitters. QVC's transponder service agreements for the Company's U.S. transponders expire at the earlier of the end of the lives of the satellites or the service agreements. The service agreements for QVC-U.S. and HSN expire between 2019 and 2025. The service agreements for QVC-International transponders and terrestrial transmitters expire between 2019 and 2027.
I-5

We continually seek to expand and enhance our broadcast and e-commerce platforms, as well as to further our international operations and multimedia capabilities. We offer native high definition ("HD") programming in addition to standard definition programming, which provides additional channel locations and allows us to utilize a typically wider screen with crisper and more colorful images to present a larger “storefront,” which we believe captures the attention of channel “surfers” and engages our customers. In the U.S., QVCHD and HSNHD reach approximately 85 million and 75 million households, respectively. We continue to develop and launch features to further enrich the viewing experience.
Beyond the live programming QVC networks in the U.S., Germany and the U.K. also broadcast on additional networks that offer viewers access to a broader range of QVC programming options. These networks include QVC2, HSN 2 and Beauty iQ in the U.S., QVC Style and QVC2 in Germany and QVC Beauty, QVC Extra, and QVC Style in the U.K.
Affiliation agreements
QVC enters into long-term affiliation agreements with certain of our television distributors who downlink our programming and distribute the programming to their customers. Our affiliation agreements with QVC distributors have termination dates ranging from 2019 to 2024. Our ability to continue to sell products to our customers is dependent on our ability to maintain and renew these affiliation agreements in the future. Although we are typically successful in obtaining and renewing these agreements, we do not have distribution agreements with some of the distributors that carry our programming. In total, we are currently providing programming without affiliation agreements to distributors representing approximately 6.4% of our QVC-U.S. distribution and approximately 0.4% of our HSN distribution. Some of our international programming may continue to be carried by distributors after the expiration dates on our affiliation agreements with them have passed.
In return for carrying our signals, each programming distributor for our U.S. distribution receives an allocated portion, based upon market share, of up to 5% of the net sales of merchandise sold via the television programs and from certain Internet sales to customers located in the programming distributor's service areas. In some cases, pay television operators receive additional compensation in the form of commission guarantees in exchange for their commitments to deliver a specified number of subscribers, channel placement incentives and advertising insertion time. QVC-International programming distributors predominantly receive an agreed-upon annual fee, a monthly or yearly fee per subscriber regardless of the net sales, a variable percentage of net sales or some combination of the above arrangements.
In addition to sales-based commissions or per-subscriber fees, QVC also makes payments to distributors primarily in the U.S. for carriage and to secure channel positioning within a broadcast area or within the general entertainment area on the distributor's channel line-up. We believe that a portion of our sales is attributable to purchases resulting from channel "surfing" and that a channel position near broadcast networks and more popular cable networks increases the likelihood of such purchases. As technology evolves, we will continue to monitor optimal channel placement and attempt to negotiate agreements with our distributors to maximize the viewership of our television programming.
Demographics of customers
We enjoy a very loyal customer base, as demonstrated by the fact that for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, approximately 86% of our QVC-U.S. and HSN shipped sales came from repeat customers (i.e., customers who made a purchase from us during the prior twelve months), who spent an average of $1,064 each during this period. An additional 7% of shipped sales in that period came from reactivated customers (i.e., customers who previously made a purchase from us, but not during the prior twelve months). 
QVC had slight growth in customer count during 2018, not including the impact for the inclusion of HSN. On a trailing twelve month basis, total net consolidated customers (excluding the joint venture in China) were approximately 15.5 million which includes gross customers of 8.3 million in QVC-U.S., 4.5 million in HSN and 4.7 million in QVC-International. We believe our core customer base represents an attractive demographic target market. Based on internal customer data for QVC-U.S. and HSN, approximately 51% of our 12.8 million U.S. customers for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 were women between the ages of 35 and 64.
Order taking and fulfillment
We strive to be prompt and efficient in order taking and fulfillment. We take a majority of our orders via our websites and via mobile applications on iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Android and other platforms. QVC-U.S, QVC-International, and HSN customers placed approximately 39%, 29%, and 32%, respectively, of all orders directly through their mobile devices in 2018.
I-6

QVC-U.S. has two customer contact centers, located in San Antonio, Texas and Chesapeake, Virginia, that can direct calls, e-mail contacts and social contacts from one center to the other as volume mandates. HSN has one customer contact center, located in St. Petersburg, Florida. Internationally, we have customer contact centers in Chiba, Japan; Knowsley, U.K.; Brugherio, Italy; and Bochum and Kassel, Germany. For France, order taking is handled by a third party located in Portugal. Many markets also utilize home agents to handle calls, allowing staffing flexibility for peak hours. In addition, QVC-Global and HSN utilize computerized interactive voice response order systems for telephonic orders, which handle approximately 24.1% of all orders taken on a worldwide basis.
Our QVC-U.S. distribution centers are located in Suffolk, Virginia; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Rocky Mount, North Carolina; Florence, South Carolina; and Ontario, California. Our QVC-U.S. distribution centers and drop ship partners have shipped nearly 698,000 units in a single day during 2018. Our HSN distribution centers are located in Bristol, Virginia; Piney Flats, Tennessee; Fontana, California; Greeneville, Tennessee; Morristown, Tennessee and Roanoke, Virginia, and they were able to ship 314,000 units in a single day during 2018. We also have distribution centers in Sakura-shi, Chiba, Japan; Hücklehoven, Germany; Knowsley, U.K. and Castel San Giovanni, Italy.
QVC has built a scalable operating infrastructure focused on sustaining efficient, flexible and cost-effective sale and distribution of our products. Since our physical store locations are minimal, we require lower inventory levels and capital expenditures compared to traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. In recent years, we have made significant investments in our distribution centers that we believe will accommodate our foreseeable growth needs. Further, since we have no set “floor plan” and can closely manage inventory levels at our centralized warehouses, we believe we have the flexibility to analyze and react quickly to changing trends and demand by shifting programming time and product mix. Our cost structure is highly variable, which we believe allows us to consistently achieve attractive margins relative to brick-and-mortar retailers.
Third party carriers transport our packages from our distribution centers to our customers. In each market where we operate, we have negotiated long-term contracts with shipping companies, which in certain circumstances provide for favorable shipping rates.
Competition
We operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive retail business environment. Based on U.S. net revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we are the leading video retailer in the U.S. and generate substantially more net revenue than our closest video shopping competitor, EVINE Live. Our international operations face similar competition in their respective markets, such as Shop Channel in Japan, HSE 24 in Germany, Austria, and Italy, Ideal World in the U.K, and M6 Boutique in France. Additionally, we have numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, ranging from large department stores to specialty shops, e-commerce retailers, direct marketing retailers, wholesale clubs, discount retailers, infomercial retailers, and mail-order and catalog companies.
We also compete for access to customers and audience share with other providers of broadcast, online and hard copy entertainment and content. The price and availability of other programming and the conversion to digital programming platforms may unfavorably affect the placement of our programming in the channel line-ups of our distributors, and may affect our ability to obtain distribution agreements with small cable distributors. Competition from other programming also affects the compensation that must be paid to distributors for carriage, which continues to increase. Principal competitive factors for us include (i) value, quality and selection of merchandise; (ii) customer experience, including customer service and reliability of fulfillment and delivery services and (iii) convenience and accessibility of sales channels.
We have established QVC-U.S. and HSN as leaders in video shopping, e-commerce, mobile commerce and social commerce by curating quality products at outstanding values, providing exceptional customer service, establishing favorable channel positioning and multiple touchpoints across digital platforms and generating repeat business from our core customer base. We believe QVC-U.S. and HSN also compare favorably in terms of sales to general, non-video based retailers due to our extensive customer reach and efficient cost structure.
Employees
QVC-Global employed approximately 17,400 full-time and part-time employees as of December 31, 2018, and HSN employed approximately 4,000 full-time and part-time employees as of December 31, 2018. Employment levels fluctuate due to seasonal factors affecting our business. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce, particularly on a seasonal basis. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Government regulation
The manner in which we sell and promote merchandise and related claims and representations made in connection with these efforts is regulated by federal and state law. Some examples of regulatory agencies and regulations that affect the manner in which we sell and promote merchandise include the following:

• | The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and the state attorneys general regulate the advertising of retail products and services offered for sale in the U.S., including the FTC's Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising and Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims.


• | The Food and Drug Administration has specific regulations regarding claims that can be made about food products and regulates marketing claims that can be made for cosmetic beauty products, medical devices and over-the-counter drugs.


• | The Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") requires products that make certain types of claims, such as "anti-bacterial," to be registered with the EPA prior to making such claims.


• | Each of the FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rules, the Federal Communication Commission's ("FCC") rules implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and similar state laws, establish procedures that must be followed when telemarketing or placing particular types of calls to consumers.


• | The Consumer Product Safety Commission has specific regulations regarding products that present unreasonable risks of injuries to consumers.


• | Import and export laws, including U.S. economic sanction and embargo regulations, U.S. homeland security laws and regulations and other laws such as the U.S. anti-boycott law and U.S. export controls regulations.


• | Comparable regulatory agencies and regulations in countries in which we have our non-U.S. operations.

In addition, the FCC regulates the cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") distributors and other multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs") that distribute the Company’s services, has adopted various requirements related to the Company’s programming, and also licenses radio transmission facilities that the Company uses in connection with its business, such as satellite uplink facilities and internal private radio systems.
As a result of an interest in various cable operators attributed to Qurate Retail, the Company may be deemed to be a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest for purposes of various FCC rules regarding the distribution of video programming to MVPDs. These include, for example, the FCC’s program access rules, which, in general, prohibit various unfair practices involving the distribution of video programming to MVPDs; and its program carriage rules, which, among other things, prohibit cable operators from favoring affiliated programmers so as to restrain unreasonably the ability of unaffiliated programmers to compete. The FCC program access and program carriage rules also make provision for enforcement of alleged violations through complaint proceedings initiated by aggrieved entities. The Company also may be subject to program access rules as a result of an FCC condition adopted in connection with its 2008 approval of a transaction involving a predecessor of Qurate Retail and News Corp. Previously adopted FCC channel occupancy rules, which limited carriage by a cable operator of national programming services in which that operator holds an attributable interest, were vacated and remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2001. The FCC issued further notices of proposed rulemaking in 2001 and 2005 to consider channel occupancy limitations, but has not adopted any rules. 
In 2000, we became subject to a consent decree issued by the FTC barring us from making certain deceptive claims for dietary supplements and specified products related to the common cold, pneumonia, hay fever and allergies. We also became subject to an expanded consent decree issued by the FTC in 2009 that terminates on the later of May 26, 2029, or 20 years from the most recent date that the U.S. or the FTC files a complaint in federal court alleging any violation thereunder. Pursuant to this expanded consent decree, we are prohibited from making certain claims about specified weight-loss, dietary supplement and anti-cellulite products unless we have competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate such claims. To help mitigate against the risk of future regulatory action, we review advertising claims with a particular focus on weight-loss, dietary supplements and skin care products that we offer for sale in the U.S.
In 1996, HSN became subject to a consent order issued by the FTC barring HSN (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) from making claims for specified categories of products, including claims that a given product can cure, treat or prevent any disease or have an effect on the structure or function of the human body, unless it has competent and reliable scientific evidence to 
I-8

substantiate such claims. The consent order terminates on the later of April 15, 2019, or 20 years from the most recent date that the U.S. or the FTC files a complaint in federal court alleging any violation thereunder. Violation of this consent order may result in the imposition of significant civil penalties for non-compliance and related redress to consumers and/or the issuance of an injunction enjoining us from engaging in prohibited activities. The FTC may periodically investigate our business and operations on an ongoing basis for purposes of determining our compliance with the consent order. To help mitigate against the risk of future regulatory action, HSN reviews advertising claims with a particular focus on weight-loss, dietary supplements and skin care products that HSN offers for sale in the U.S.
Congress enacted the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation ("CALM") Act in 2010. The CALM Act directs the FCC to incorporate into its rules and make mandatory a technical standard that is designed to prevent digital television commercial advertisements from being transmitted at louder volumes than the program material they accompany. The FCC's CALM Act implementing regulations became effective in 2012. Although the FCC's CALM Act regulations place direct compliance responsibility on broadcasters and MVPDs, the FCC adopted a "safe harbor" compliance approach applicable to commercials embedded in programming provided by programmers, such as the Company. Under the FCC's safe harbor approach, broadcasters and MVPDs may meet their CALM Act compliance obligations through reliance on programmer-provided CALM Act compliance certifications that are made "widely available" to broadcasters and MVPDs through a website or other means. The Company has determined that its programming is CALM Act compliant, and in response to requests from its distributors, and in order to allow its distributors to meet the FCC's safe harbor, the Company has posted a CALM Act compliance certification to a website that is available to its distributors.
FCC rules adopted pursuant to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 generally require closed captioning of the Company’s televised programming distributed on broadcast television stations, cable television systems, DBS and other MVPDs, with only limited exemptions. The FCC’s closed captioning rules applicable to televised programming place closed captioning compliance obligations directly on the Company’s distributors, and are enforced with respect to the Company’s programming through its affiliation agreements with its distributors. 2016 amendments to those rules adopted by the FCC extend direct compliance responsibility, jointly with distributors, to video programmers such as the Company, impose certain registration and certification requirements on the Company, and subject the Company to new captioning complaint procedures. Certain aspects of these amended rules have not yet become effective.
Beginning in 2012, the FCC adopted regulations pursuant to the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 that impose captioning requirements on various types of programming distributed via Internet protocol ("IP") that was previously televised with captions. A multi-year implementation period for previously televised IP-delivered programming was completed in 2016. The Company is subject to the IP-captioning rules as a Video Programming Owner and as a Video Programming Distributor that distributes covered programming on its website and via mobile and video streaming platforms. In February 2014, the FCC adopted closed captioning quality standards for televised programming distributed by the Company’s distributors. Although compliance obligations for the captioning quality standards are placed directly on the Company’s distributors, under the captioning quality rules, the Company’s distributors can demonstrate compliance with the quality rules by relying on a certification from programmers, such as the Company, that its programming satisfies the caption quality standards adopted by the FCC, that the programmer has adopted and follows captioning best practices for video programmers adopted by the FCC, or that its programming is exempt from captioning requirements. These closed captioning quality requirements took effect in March 2015. In the 2016 amendments to the closed captioning rules noted above, the FCC also extended direct responsibility for televised captioning quality to video programmers such as the Company. As a result of the foregoing changes and rules involving captioning of IP-delivered programming and captioning quality standards, QVC may incur additional costs and compliance obligations related to closed captioning of its programming.
We market and provide a broad range of merchandise through our broadcast networks, websites, mobile applications and social pages. As a result, we are subject to a wide variety of statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures in various jurisdictions that are subject to change at any time, including laws regarding consumer protection, privacy, the regulation of retailers generally, the importation, sale and promotion of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities, as well as laws and regulations applicable to the Internet and businesses engaged in online commerce, such as those regulating the sending of unsolicited, commercial electronic mail and texts.
For example, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act prohibits web sites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without parental consent and imposes a number of operational requirements. Certain email activities are subject to the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, commonly known as the CAN-SPAM Act. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates the sending of unsolicited commercial email by requiring the email sender, among other things, to comply with specific disclosure requirements and to provide an "opt-out"

mechanism for recipients. Both of these laws include statutory penalties for non-compliance. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act limits, but does not eliminate, liability for listing or linking to third party websites that may include content that infringes on copyrights or other rights so long as our Internet businesses comply with the statutory requirements. Various states also have adopted laws regulating certain aspects of Internet communications. Federal legislation enacted in 2016 permanently extended the moratorium on state and local taxes on Internet access and commerce.
Our online commerce businesses are subject to domestic and foreign laws governing the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally-identifiable information about their users. The enactment, interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux, and the interpretation and application of such laws may vary from country to country. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which established new data laws that give customers additional rights and impose additional restrictions and penalties on companies for illegal collection and misuse of personal information, took effect in May 2018. Further, in 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the "Safe Harbor Framework," which had allowed companies to collect and process personal data in European Union nations for use in the U.S. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which replaced the Safe Harbor Framework, became fully operational on August 1, 2016, but is the subject of litigation in the EU. The European Commission proposed new regulations regarding privacy and electronic communications in 2017 which remain pending, including additional regulation of the Internet tracking tools known as "cookies." Finally, countries in other regions, most notably Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, are increasingly implementing new privacy regulations, resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be enforced.
In the U.S., the FTC has proposed a privacy policy framework, and Congress may consider legislation that would require organizations that suffer a breach of security related to personal information to notify owners of such information. Many states have adopted laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach affecting personal data, such as California's Information Practices Act. California also has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which, among other things, allows California consumers to request that certain companies disclose the types of personal information collected by such companies. The CCPA takes effect on January 1, 2020. Complying with these different national and state privacy requirements may cause the Internet companies in which we have interests to incur substantial costs. In addition, such companies generally have and post on their websites privacy policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data. A failure to comply with such posted privacy policies or with the regulatory requirements of federal, state, or foreign privacy laws could result in proceedings or actions by governmental agencies or others (such as class action litigation) which could adversely affect our online commerce businesses. 
Our business is also dependent upon our continued ability to transmit our programming to television distributors from our third party FCC-licensed satellite uplink facilities, which are subject to FCC compliance in the U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements in our international operations.
Intellectual property
We regard our trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely on a combination of trademark, patent and copyright law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to protect these proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights and domain names through U.S. and foreign governmental authorities and vigorously protect our proprietary rights against infringement.
In the U.S., we have registered trademarks and service marks including, but not limited to our brand names and logo, "QVC," "Quality Value Convenience," "Find What You Love, Love What You Find," the "Q Logo," and "Q" and trademarks for our proprietary products sold such as "Arte D’Oro," "Cook’s Essentials," "Denim & Co.," "Diamonique," "Nature's Code," "Northern Nights" and "Ultrafine Silver." Similarly, foreign registrations have been obtained for many trademarks and service marks for our brand names, logo and propriety products including, but not limited to, "QVC," the "Q Logo," "Q," "Cook’s Essentials," "Denim & Co.," "Diamonique" and "Northern Nights." 
HSN has numerous trademark registrations or pending applications in the United States which help to expand HSN’s brand awareness. These registrations and applications include the “HSN” brand name and the “HSN logo” as well as registrations for HSN’s propriety products and services, including, but not limited to, “HSN Shop By Remote,” “Technibond,” and “Concierge Collection.” 
I-10

We consider the "QVC" and "HSN" names the most significant trademarks and service marks held by us because of their impact on market awareness across all of our geographic markets and on customers’ identification with us. As with all U.S. trademarks or service marks, our trademark and service mark registrations in the U.S. are for a ten year period and are renewable every ten years, prior to their respective expirations, as long as the trademarks or service marks are used in the regular course of trade.
Qurate Retail relationship and related party transactions
The Company is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail (Nasdaq: QRTEA and QRTEB), which owns interests in a broad range of digital commerce businesses, including Qurate Retail's other wholly-owned subsidiaries zulily, llc ("zulily") and Cornerstone Brands, Inc.("CBI"), as well as other minority investments. QVC is part of the Qurate Retail Group ("QRG"), formerly QVC Group, a portfolio of brands including QVC, HSN, zulily and CBI. On March 9, 2018, Qurate Retail, GCI Liberty, Inc. ("GCI Liberty") (formerly General Communication, Inc.), an Alaska corporation, and Liberty Interactive LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail completed transactions whereby Qurate Retail acquired GCI Liberty through a reorganization in which certain assets and liabilities attributed to Qurate Retail’s Ventures Group were contributed to GCI Liberty in exchange for a controlling interest in GCI Liberty. Qurate Retail then effected a tax-free separation of its controlling interest in the combined company. Qurate Retail's QVC Group common stock became the only outstanding common stock of Qurate Retail. 
On October 1, 2015, Qurate Retail acquired all of the outstanding shares of zulily (now known as zulily, llc). zulily is an online retailer offering customers a fun and entertaining shopping experience with a fresh selection of new product styles launched each day for a limited time period. The Company believes zulily's business is complementary to our Company. zulily is not part of the results of operations or financial position of QVC presented in this Form 10-K. QVC and zulily engage in multiple transactions relating to sales, sourcing of merchandise, marketing initiatives, business advisory services and software development. Refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
On December 31, 2018, QVC amended and restated its senior secured credit facility (the "Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") increasing the revolving credit facility from $2.65 billion to $3.65 billion as explained further in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. The Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes a $400 million tranche that may be borrowed by QVC or zulily. Under the terms of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, QVC and zulily are jointly and severally liable for all amounts borrowed on the $400 million tranche. In accordance with the accounting guidance for obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements, QVC will record a liability for amounts it has borrowed under the credit facility plus any additional amount it expects to repay on behalf of zulily. As of December 31, 2018, there was $135 million borrowed by zulily on the $400 million tranche of the senior secured credit facility, none of which the Company expects to repay on behalf of zulily.
On October 17, 2018, QRG announced a series of initiatives designed to better position its HSN and QVC- U.S. businesses (“QRG Initiatives”). As part of the QRG Initiatives, QVC will close its fulfillment center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and has entered into an agreement to lease a new fulfillment center in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, commencing in 2019 (see note 9 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements). QVC recorded transaction related costs of $60 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, which primarily related to severance and other QRG initiatives.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, QVC recorded a charge related to the potential closure of its operations in France. For the year ended December 31, 2018, QVC has recorded $9 million in severance expenses and $4 million in inventory obsolescence related to these potential exit activities. 
QVC engages with CBI, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail and prior to the common control transaction between QVC and Qurate Retail, included as part of HSN.

Refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
I-11

We are a "close corporation" under Delaware law and, as such, our stockholder, rather than a board of directors, manages our business. Since our stockholder is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail, certain aspects of our management, including the approval of significant corporate transactions such as a change of control, are controlled by Qurate Retail, rather than an independent governing body. Our Chief Executive Officer and President, Michael A. George, also became president and chief executive officer of Qurate Retail during 2018.
Qurate Retail's interests may not coincide with our interests or yours and Qurate Retail may cause us to enter into transactions or agreements with related parties or approve corporate actions that could involve conflicts of interest. For example, Qurate Retail's dependence on our cash flow for servicing its debt and for other purposes is likely to result in our payment of large dividends to Qurate Retail, which may increase our leverage and decrease our liquidity. We paid $367 million of dividends to Qurate Retail during 2018, $866 million of dividends to Qurate Retail during 2017 and $703 million of dividends to Qurate Retail during 2016. See also Item 1A. "Risk Factors."
