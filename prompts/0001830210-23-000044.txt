Item 1. Business
Introduction
Benson Hill is a food technology company on a mission to lead the pace of innovation in food. We have a vision to build a healthier and happier world by unlocking the natural genetic diversity of plants with our leading technology platform, CropOS®. Starting with consumer demand, we leverage CropOS and advanced breeding techniques to design food that’s better from the beginning: more nutritious, more flavorful, and more accessible, while enabling efficient production and delivering novel sustainability benefits to food and feed customers. We are headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, where the majority of our research and development activities are managed. We operate a soy crushing and food-grade white flake and soy flour manufacturing operation in Creston, Iowa, a soy crushing facility in Seymour, Indiana, and we process dry peas in North Dakota, which we sell throughout North America.
We have an integrated go-to-market approach, leveraging the existing parts of the supply chain to create efficiencies and a feedback loop between consumers, farmers, and seed developers that has been lacking across the siloed agri-food value chain. We are working to design products with the consumer in mind, contract with farmers to grow and buy back the harvest, preserve the product identity through manufacturing, and ultimately sell food and ingredients directly to food companies, retailers, and others. We believe this integration and control of the product throughout the entire supply chain will enable us to link data to outcomes in our CropOS platform to fuel the next generation of products. Additionally, we believe this product information linkage will work to optimize environmental and social impacts, as well as traceability throughout the supply chain.
We believe that our commitment to environmental and social issues impacting our planet and our purpose-driven culture are fundamental to our ability to achieve our mission. Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) principles help guide our thinking and approach throughout the development and commercialization of our products, and our innovative culture is rooted in our Core Values of Be Bold, Be Inspired and Be Real. We believe our leading technology platform, vertically integrated go-to-market strategy, and purpose-driven culture will help bridge the divide between evolving consumer preferences and quality traits already present within the genetic diversity of plants. We see nature as our partner; technology as our enabler; and innovators like our company, our stakeholders, our stockholders and our partners as the catalysts to activate the change needed.
We partner with farmers, ingredient companies, and plant-based food and feed customers to commercialize our proprietary innovations in soybean, and in the near future yellow pea, for broad market applications in human food ingredients, edible oils, pet food and aquafeed. In particular, our Ultra-High Protein (“UHP”) soy-based ingredients have the potential to eliminate costly water- and energy-intensive ingredient processing steps associated with producing soy protein concentrate (“SPC”) products for the food and feed markets, which can alleviate supply constraints in North America and elsewhere. Our proprietary portfolio includes soy flake, soy grits, soy meal and soy flour for established food markets such as snacks, baked goods and meat extensions, and a functional alternative to traditional SPC for plant-based protein alternatives to meat, dairy, and other emerging categories.
Evolving Food Industry
Consumers are demanding food choices with more recognizable ingredients that benefit their health and the health of our planet. By combining proprietary data with artificial intelligence capabilities, advances in plant genomics and with our go-to-market strategy, we believe we can accelerate the development and delivery of better food and ingredient options from the beginning—with a focus on both quantity and quality. Our approach aims to develop food, feed, and ingredients that fuel accessible scaling and product differentiation for evolving consumer preferences, with a particular focus on the fast growing plant-based food market.
As awareness of diet-related health issues and environmental concerns grow, consumers are emphasizing a healthier lifestyle and a desire for nutritionally rich foods that are better tasting, less processed, more sustainable, and with fewer additives. These trends are increasing the demand for innovation in plant-based foods. Companies across the value chain are working to formulate new products for this category with a focus on taste, nutrition, traceability, accessibility, and sustainability. As a result of these major trends, food companies are looking for specialty ingredients and foods that satisfy customers’ evolving needs and drive sustainable practices.

Our modern food system is an amazing innovation. Genomics has been used for decades to develop crops for our food system, but most agricultural companies have focused almost exclusively on increasing the yield of a few crops, resulting in commodity ingredients and a food system based on the quantity of calories available. We believe the current food supply chain is siloed with fundamental disconnects that prevent it from adapting to rapidly changing consumer demands. Grain processors and food manufacturers are largely limited to commodity ingredients. While focus on quantity is important, it often comes with trade-offs in areas such as nutrient density and flavor.
Our Strengths and Solution: Technology and CropOS Platform
Navigating the pressures on our food system will require innovation, as well as better connectivity not only from farm to fork but also from seed to fork. Technology is an essential enabler as innovation cycles in food are not measured in weeks or months; they’re measured in years. A key differentiator for Benson Hill is our holistic approach to product development that starts with the consumer outcome and leverages the combination of data science, plant science and food science to achieve it. 
Our CropOS food innovation engine is a proprietary, continuously learning and expanding product design and development platform that uses predictive breeding and other advanced tools like CRISPR gene editing technology to tap into the vast potential within the genome. We believe that the combination of the predictive capability of the CropOS platform, the precision of our genomic tools, our Crop Accelerator (a controlled environment research facility), and our extensive field-testing network will enable us to develop differentiated products with targeted attributes much more quickly and cost effectively than traditional methods. 
We designed our headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri, to foster an intentional gathering of data science, plant science and food science disciplines within 160,000 square feet, including 25,000 square feet of laboratory space. We are working on capturing consumer-relevant data on products through our food innovation team, along with insights from our integrated supply chain, from which we draw meaningful and actionable linkages back to plants’ genetics and direct product development through a process we call food digitization.
We are developing products leveraging our CropOS platform through a three-step, iterative “Design, Build, Test” process that improves in precision and intelligence with each turn of the flywheel. The key inputs to our approach are twofold. The first is an unparalleled data library comprising genotypic, phenotypic, and agronomic data on our crops, consumer insight data on our ingredients, and environmental data on our growing sites. The second is a robust machine learning capability, which leverages our data library to design before we build. We believe this combination of relevant data and advanced simulation lets us get our products to market more efficiently, faster, and on timelines that can more effectively respond to evolving consumer preferences and farmer needs.
In our Design step, the CropOS platform employs a diverse array of simulations and predictions to execute the most efficient and cost-effective path to novel product development. The platform can consider billions of data points in millions of pipeline configurations to identify the starting parental plant breeding combinations, predict gene targets, and analyze optimal farm management and environmental conditions. These state-of-the-art platform capabilities and enabling technologies allow us to assess the probability of success early in the research and development process, focusing resources and avoiding potentially expensive late-stage failures. In turn, this allows for a larger breadth of products to be designed.
Once an optimal path is identified, we enter our Build step. In this stage of our development process, candidate products are created through predictive breeding and gene editing. Our proprietary suite of gene editing technologies and intellectual property portfolio enable us to edit the plant’s own genome predictably and precisely, which we consider an advance form of seed breeding. We can leverage our knowledge of plant gene functions to unlock and restore lost or muted genetic variation that is within the natural diversity of the plant or knock out genes that are unwanted. This approach is distinguished from transgenic, or “GMO” technology, in that we are advancing natural genetic variation that could be achieved using traditional breeding approaches rather than introducing genes foreign to the species.
Through our Crop Accelerator, opened in October 2021, in St. Louis, Missouri, the Build step of our process is sped up within our controlled environment, indoor product development facility. This approximately 47,000-square-foot facility features approximately 20,000 square feet of dynamically adaptive Conviron® growth houses and chambers, equipped with sophisticated sensor and environmental controls, including multi-channel LEDs, imaging capabilities, additive carbon dioxide, and temperature, humidity, and lighting controls. The Crop Accelerator enables rapid testing and target candidate selection over multiple growth cycles. Insights and data points gathered during each growing cycle further enhance the predictive capabilities of the CropOS platform. We believe this cycle of feedback will accelerate our ability to develop new offerings, including continued expansion of our proprietary portfolio of soy ingredients.

After a potential commercial product is built, it then enters our Test step where it is evaluated within our network (comprised of internal and third-party sites and capabilities) of hundreds of field-level testing research and production sites. We believe our predictive optimization capabilities have the potential to maximize the return on our genetics by using proprietary placement models, which are built on environmental and performance data to predict where to contract acres to lift protein content. We then use digital agriculture technology to collect on-farm data through our grower data partnership program and other relationships to enhance the CropOS platform, further feeding our data flywheel. 
Environmental, Social and Governance Strategy
Environmental and social impact strategy guides our work and is a competitive advantage that helps to guide decisions and work across our company. We believe our ESG strategy is fundamental to achieving our vision and long-term profitability. We are striving to optimize the environmental impact of our facilities and operations, but we recognize the greatest potential for impact is through our product development process of designing seeds, ingredients, and food that generates social and environmental benefit throughout the food value chain for all stakeholders.
At the farm level, we believe our integrated business model will offer additional revenue opportunities for farmers through potential input efficiencies, ecosystem service markets, and allow us to drive conservation and regeneration farming practices. At the manufacturing level, we are designing products that we believe will reduce water and energy intensive processing steps. And at the product level, we believe we can enable improved scaling, accessibility, and adoption of end products with environmental and social benefits, such as plant-based meats, meat extension products, and dairy alternatives.
Benson Hill has developed an internal strategy including foundational policies and processes to manage and assess our ESG success and impact. As a company, some of our primary ESG goals are the following:
Develop nutrient rich and sustainable ingredient options for food companies and retailers. Driven by growing consumer demand and climate-related risks, many food manufacturers have set ESG measurement and reporting programs, such as reporting on their own greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission production. Benson Hill is positioned to assist in meeting food and feed manufacturers’ goals of reducing GHG emissions in their scope 3 supply chains by developing products with reduced environmental impact. For example, Benson Hill has conducted a consultant-led life cycle assessment on one of our UHP soybean ingredient products, and our preliminary results show a significant reduction in required GHG emissions and water use due to the reduction, or elimination, of a protein-concentration processing step that is used to create commodity soy protein concentrate today. We believe this reduction in GHG emissions and water, among other environmental impact indicators, will support our food manufacturer customers’ ESG objectives.
Improve farm cost-effectiveness and sustainability. Our farmer partners are critical to our commercial success, and we value these relationships greatly. Benson Hill’s on-farm ESG strategy addresses two key concerns for farmers — first, ongoing pressure to reduce food production costs, and second, best practices for land and soil stewardship to ensure long-term viability. Our strategy is to directly collect agronomic performance data from the farm and provide recommendations for land conservation and regenerative practices, as well as enable profitable opportunities through input reduction or alternative revenue streams. Agronomic data collection will inform data-based decision making in our product life cycle assessments, company GHG emissions assessments, product development and many other business functions.
Meet consumer demands for supply chain transparency and traceability. Through our integrated business model, we have the ability to maintain the integrity of our proprietary products through each stage of the supply chain, until the product is sold to our customers. We believe this enables us to enhance transparency and traceability, which is appealing to our customers. This approach provides us direct line of sight to data we intend to collect, as well as creates strong partnerships with our seed growers, farmers, and agrifood partners. We are working toward being able to measure the environmental impact at the farm through manufacturing as well as at the product level. Through improved traceability capabilities, Benson Hill will also continue to seek out and leverage third-party certifications, such as the Non-GMO Project Verified, ProTerra certification or others, meeting certain demands for both food and feed manufacturers and consumers.
Recruit and retain purpose-driven talent. Current research suggests employees are increasingly interested in working for companies that have an integrated ESG mission and purpose. Benson Hill has developed processes and internal programs, such as employee-led committees, that promote working together and re-thinking how we do business within our company, with our partners, and across the supply chain. We are working to develop teams that are grounded in a spirit of diversity, equality, and inclusion, and encouraged to think more innovatively, boldly, and transparently. Our goal is a workplace that is not just productive, but one of mutual respect and an environment for team members to continuously develop as professionals.

Benson Hill’s ESG strategy and business objectives will continue to progress and evolve based on industry shifts and stakeholders’ needs. We believe our long-term profitability goals and our ESG strategy are mutually inclusive concepts.
Merger with Star Peak Corp II
On September 29, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), Star Peak Corp II (“STPC”), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated a merger (the “Closing”) pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May 8, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among STPC, STPC Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of STPC (“Merger Sub”), and Benson Hill, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Legacy Benson Hill”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, a business combination between STPC and Legacy Benson Hill was affected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Legacy Benson Hill, with Legacy Benson Hill surviving the transaction as a wholly owned subsidiary of STPC (the “Merger”). On the Closing Date, STPC changed its name to Benson Hill, Inc. and Legacy Benson Hill changed its name to Benson Hill Holdings, Inc. As a consequence of the Merger, we became the successor to a company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). Our future results of consolidated operations and financial position may not be comparable to historical results as a result of the Merger.
Business Segments, Growth Strategies, and Products
Benson Hill’s business is comprised of one operating and reportable segment, our Ingredients Business, which aims to combine our seed innovation through our CropOS platform with critical infrastructure capabilities and best practices in the field to develop and commercialize differentiated products. We are currently developing a diversified portfolio spanning the following key markets — protein ingredients, aquaculture and specialty animal feed, and vegetable oils. For each product, our research and development efforts are focused on quality-centric traits, such as nutrient density, carbohydrate profiles, flavor, ingredient functionality, and sustainability, as well as yield potential and agronomic improvements. 
Integral to our go-to-market strategy are the infrastructure capabilities along with partnerships across the supply chain. Unlike traditional agriculture crop improvement companies that have typically focused their impact on development of the seed that they sell to the farmer, we have an integrated supply chain through directly owned or controlled assets, tolling agreements, and strategic partnerships in order to provide adequate capacity and influence throughout the food and ingredient supply chain. We believe this approach ensures the integrity of our products, and enables the efficient development, commercialization, and scaling of our product offerings. Importantly, it also enables a more direct relationship with those who will be realizing the benefits of those products—i.e., retailers, consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) companies, and consumers—which informs our product development.
Our partnerships with farmers are an essential part of our supply chain. Within the traditional agriculture industry, farmers typically sell to elevators or processors who operate a high volume/low margin business to store commodity crops and convert them into largely aquaculture and specialty animal feed and industrial products. Our strategy is to partner with farmers who grow our seeds using appropriate agronomic and identity preservation practices and, in turn, we purchase their harvest for ultimate sale to an end-user customer. We believe structuring the relationship in this way will better allow us to drive best practices for on-farm sustainability, ensure traceability of our products, and help create new markets and profitable opportunities for farmers.
Once we obtain the harvest from the farmer, we secure the processing and distribution capacity that is appropriate for the product to meet our customers where they are. CPG and retailer customers sell directly to consumers. We share their focus on the end consumer in order to better align incentives, focus product development, and deliver our products through a channel that best serves their supply chain with the high-quality standards, traceability, and sustainability data that consumers desire.
Our growth strategy, or “growth playbook,” is a repeatable process that we believe will enable us to remain at the forefront of food and agriculture innovation.
•Step 1: Create the foundation — At this initial step, we are focused on entering the market through an owned or controlled channel, selling non-proprietary products to agrifood manufacturers, food and ingredient companies, aquaculture and specialty animal feed customers, and retailers. We use this time to build relationships across the value chain and invest in the data to inform our CropOS® platform with low capital investment.
•Step 2: Integrated route to market — In this step, we introduce our proprietary products in the channel to prove the product concept, scale, ensure traceability, and catalyze customer demand for our differentiated products. This stage may include the use of owned or third-party processing capabilities, and exploring strategic partnerships that can further expand production capacities.

•Step 3: Broad adoption — We believe this will be the most asset-light step of our strategy where we intend to focus on maximizing the benefit and scale of our proprietary products by building partnerships and licensing relationships for our products. In this step, it is envisioned that we will grow beyond our proving ground acreage and increase commercial and supply chain efficiencies by leveraging others’ existing infrastructure. 
As part of our growth strategy, we may pursue merger and acquisition opportunities to expand our capabilities and grow our industry and geographic footprint. 
Ingredients Business Segment
Our Ingredients Business is currently focused on enhancing soy and yellow pea with proprietary ingredients serving multiple plant-based protein markets through customers including ingredient companies, CPG companies, aquaculture production and feed companies, food-service operations, and grocery retail.
Soy Ingredient Products
We are in Step 3 of our growth playbook for our soy ingredients business and are currently working to scale our current generation of proprietary soy products targeted toward the protein ingredients, aquaculture and specialty animal feed, and vegetable oils markets.
We entered into a strategic partnership with Archer Daniels, Midland (“ADM”) in August of 2022 to collaborate on an exclusive basis in the commercialization of certain high-protein soy ingredients for the human food and nutrition market in North America based on certain of our proprietary commercial soybean seed genetics. We collaborate with ADM to use certain of our UHP varieties with their farmer network, soy crush capabilities in Decatur, Illinois, and market and sales organizations to offer new and existing ingredient products a broad base of customers. We seek to partner with others to further leverage our current and future innovations in soy and yellow pea.
Our current focus is on specialty markets that have historically lacked value-added innovations. 
•Protein Ingredients Market: Soy, specifically soy protein concentrate (“SPC”), is the number one protein ingredient used in plant-based meat applications. SPC is largely made through the processing of defatted soy flour, which is costly and water- and energy-intensive. Our initial offerings include a high-protein soy flour that is a less processed alternative to SPC, as well as texturized protein ingredients for broad use across soy protein applications, including for plant-based alternatives. 
Our pipeline of soy products for food-grade applications includes high-protein and UHP soy flour, flake and texturized flour ingredients. We are in the process of developing future generation of products with improved protein qualities and other functional attributes to better serve the needs of our customers and ultimately the consumer.
•Aquaculture and Specialty Animal Feed: Soybean meal is an ideal protein source for swine, poultry, and fish due to its availability, cost, high protein content, and balanced amino acid profile. However, its use is restricted because, like many plant proteins, soybean meal has a high concentration of anti-nutritional compounds (“ANCs”), including oligosaccharides such as raffinose and stachyose that can have a negative effect on protein digestibility, leading to low energy values, poor metabolism, and excessive secretion impacting water quality in aquaculture systems. Apart from anti-nutritional factors, the steady historical decline in protein content of soy — an unintended consequence of breeding primarily for yield and other agronomic traits — has rendered soy meal a continually less valuable feed ingredient.
Our pipeline of soy products for aquaculture and specialty animal feed includes a high protein soymeal that is low in anti-nutrients and a low-cost, sustainable SPC substitute. As we build this portfolio of feed products, we intend to devote additional research and development resources toward developing future generations of products with improved protein qualities to further improve the value of feed ingredients options available to formulators that seek to prioritize fish and animal health, sustainability, and profitability of their operations.
•Vegetable Oils: In 2020, we launched Veri™, a non-GMO, high-heat soy cooking oil that is rich with omega-9 fatty acids. Our Veri™ brand soy oil is high in oleic acid and low in linolenic acid with an optimized fatty acid profile from both a human consumption and food service operations standpoint.

Yellow Pea Ingredients
We are in Step 1 of our growth playbook for yellow pea, and over the near term we expect to enter Step 2 with the start of commercialization of our first proprietary yellow pea protein ingredient products through our existing supply chain infrastructure, including premium texturized and un-texturized yellow pea protein concentrates.
Despite being one of the fastest growing protein ingredients for plant-based meats, yellow pea has received comparatively little genomic innovation to date. The pea-based protein ingredient primarily used today by many plant-based companies, is pea protein isolate (“PPI”). The PPI production process, similar to SPC, is expensive as well as water- and energy- intensive; however, such processing is necessary to concentrate protein to higher levels and help ameliorate native off-putting flavors of pea.
We have sequenced and assembled a reference genome for yellow pea — a high resolution “genomic map” — that, in combination with our CropOS® platform, is enabling us to accelerate our yellow pea breeding program. As a result, we believe we will develop differentiated varieties of yellow pea for first commercial plantings in the near term. We are working on a pipeline of products that has the potential to significantly reduce off-flavors, increase the protein content of the plant, and ultimately reduce or displace the need for expensive, water- and energy-intensive processing steps typically required for ingredients used in plant-based meat alternatives.
Our subsidiary Dakota Dry Bean Inc., an upper Midwest-based yellow pea processor, has an established channel with commodity pea protein concentrate, split peas, pea flour and pea fiber. We have expanded and upgraded the capabilities of Dakota Ingredients to better serve the pet and human food markets. Through our elite grower program and integrated production capabilities, the operation can now test premium yellow pea varieties and supply ingredients that are traceable and meet certain food-grade, kosher, and non-GMO certification standards. 
Our proprietary and non-proprietary revenues were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021
Proprietary | $ | 72,578 | | | $ | 38,043
Non-Proprietary | 308,655 | | | $ | 52,902 | 
Total Revenues | 381,233 | | | 90,945 | 

Fresh Business Segment divestiture 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company made a strategic decision to exit the Fresh segment. On December 29, 2022, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell J&J Produce, Inc. (“J&J”) and all of the outstanding equity securities of J&J’s subsidiaries for aggregate cash consideration of $3 million, subject to certain adjustments (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”). J&J was the main component of the Fresh segment. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement is scheduled to occur on June 30, 2023, or such other date as is mutually agreed by the parties. In connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, on December 29, 2022, J&J entered into a purchase and sale agreement, pursuant to which J&J sold certain real and personal property comprising an agricultural production and processing facility located in Vero Beach, Florida for an aggregate purchase price of $18 million, subject to certain adjustments (the “Purchase and Sale Agreement”). Certain property was leased back to J&J pursuant to a separate agricultural and facility lease for a short period of time. The Company’s strategic shift to exit the Fresh segment met the criteria to be classified as businesses held for sale and to be presented as a discontinued operation. Refer to Footnote 4  —  Discontinued Operations for further details on the divestiture of the Fresh segment.
Competitors
We believe that our technology platform coupled with our integrated go-to-market approach is unique to Benson Hill and sets us apart from others in the agriculture and food markets, but we do compete with others in certain areas of our business. For example, we compete with seeds and trait companies as well as smaller biotechnology and ag-tech companies, particularly for grower contracting and access to acres. Key competitors in this space include Bayer, Corteva, Syngenta, and Pairwise. For our ingredients that are commercialized, we compete with food and feed ingredient companies. Key competitors in these industries include Archer Daniels Midland Company, CHS, Inc., and Cargill, Inc. In addition, advancements in fields such as gene editing, biologics, digital agriculture, data science, and artificial intelligence may enable disruptive technology that could alter the competitive landscape for food and agriculture.

Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property and proprietary protection for our product candidates and technology related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, licensing and filing United States (“U.S.”) and certain non-U.S. patents and patent applications related to our technology, products and product candidates, and improvements that are important to the development of our business, where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, plant breeders’ rights, and/or contractual provisions to develop and maintain our proprietary position and protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and contractors. Notwithstanding these efforts, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have licensed or filed or may license or file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents we have licensed or patents that may be licensed or granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and technology. Moreover, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry — Risks Relating to Intellectual Property.”
As of December 31, 2022, we have approximately 238 pending or issued patents. Approximately 89 of those are for plant varieties, 76% of which have issued. Approximately 87 are product-related, 29% of which have issued. Approximately 62 are enabling technologies, 5% of which have issued. All patents or applications filed on our plant varieties are in the U.S., while 37% and 47% of the product-related or enabling technology patents are in the U.S., respectively. We also have approximately 92 pending applications for plant breeders’ rights on our plant varieties, divided among the U.S. and other countries. In addition to these patents and patent applications, we also hold licenses from other parties related to certain products and activities.
These patents expire at varying times depending on the jurisdiction and filing date. Individual patent terms extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which patent applications are filed, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the first non-provisional application to which priority is claimed. Under certain circumstances, a patent term can be extended. For example, in the U.S., a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in reviewing and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 26 U.S. trademarks and six pending U.S. trademark applications, and we had 97 registered non-U.S. trademarks and 18 pending non-U.S. trademark applications.
Research and Development
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 175 employees dedicated to our product and platform development. This team has technical expertise in data science, machine learning software, genome engineering, molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics and genetic engineering, plant physiology, and plant breeding. The activities of this team are conducted principally at our St. Louis, Missouri facilities. We have made, and will continue to make, substantial investments in this capability. Our research and development expenses were $47.5 million, $40.6 million and $29.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 575 individuals in total, including approximately 440 full-time employees.

Regulatory
We are subject to laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. This includes laws and regulations governing biotechnology and food companies related to the development, approval, manufacturing, import, marketing, and sale of our products.
Regulation of Plant Biotechnology Products
The three primary agencies with responsibility for regulation of plant biotechnology products in the U.S. are the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (“USDA”) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (“APHIS”), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). APHIS regulates plant biotechnology products to ensure that they do not pose a plant pest risk under the Plant Protection Act. The EPA regulates pesticides (including plant-incorporated protectants) pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”). The FDA regulates food and animal feed under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”).
Plant gene editing uses relatively new technology and the regulatory landscape continues to evolve in this area. Under the USDA’s recently revised regulations, certain categories of our products currently in development using gene editing may be exempt from certain regulations related to genetic engineering under the Plant Protection Act because they could otherwise have been developed through conventional breeding techniques, which may include gene edited soybeans or yellow peas. Other plant biotechnology products currently in development may be subject to certain regulations related to genetic engineering under the Plant Protection Act in the future. The FDA offers a voluntary consultation process to determine whether foods derived from plant biotechnology products would require regulatory review and approval before marketing such products.
Other countries also have laws and regulations that apply to plant biotechnology products. The regulatory landscape around gene edited plant biotechnology products varies in each country and continues to evolve.
Regulation of Food and Ingredient Products
We are also subject to laws and regulations administered by various federal, state and local government agencies in the U.S., such as the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the EPA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the USDA, related to the processing, packaging, distribution, sale, marketing, labeling, quality, safety, and transportation of our products, as well as our occupational safety and health practices.
Among other things, the facilities in which our products are grown, packed or processed may be required to register with the FDA, and comply with regulatory schemes including the Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), among other laws and regulations implemented by the FDA, the USDA, and other regulators. We are also subject to parallel state and local food safety regulation, including registration and licensing requirements for our facilities, enforcement of standards and label registration for our products and facilities by state and local health agencies, and regulation of our trade practices in connection with selling our products. We are also subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise.
