 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, “KLX Energy Services,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to KLX Energy Services Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect to the spin-off, and “KLX” refers to KLX Inc., its predecessors and its consolidated subsidiaries, other than, for all periods following the spin-off, KLX Energy Services Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview – The Spin-Off.” Our Company

We are a leading provider of completion, intervention and production services and products (our “product service lines” or “PSLs”) to the major onshore oil and gas producing regions of the United States. We offer a range of differentiated, complementary technical services and related tools and equipment in challenging environments that provide “mission critical” solutions for our customers throughout the life cycle of the well.

We serve many of the leading companies engaged in the exploration and development of North American onshore conventional and unconventional oil and natural gas reserves. Our customers are primarily independent major oil and gas companies. We actively support these customer operations from over 35 service facilities located in the key major shale basins. We manage our business in these basins on a geographic basis, including the Southwest Region (the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford), the Rocky Mountains Region (the Bakken, Williston, DJ, Uinta, Powder River, Piceance and Niobrara basins) and the Northeast Region (the Marcellus and Utica as well as the Mid-Continent STACK and SCOOP and Haynesville). Our revenues, operating profits and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to these three reportable geographic segments. However, while we manage our business based upon these regional groupings, our assets and our technical personnel are deployed on a dynamic basis across all of our service facilities to optimize utilization and profitability.

We work with our customers to provide engineered solutions across the entire lifecycle of the well, by streamlining operations, reducing non-productive time and developing cost effective solutions and customized tools for our customers’ most challenging service needs, which include technically complex unconventional wells requiring extended reach horizontal laterals with greater completion intensity per well. During the year ended January 31, 2019 (“Fiscal 2018”), revenue growth reflected a double-digit percentage increase in the number of new customers and a significant increase in the breadth of services provided to existing customers as compared with the same period in the prior year.

We offer a variety of targeted services that are differentiated by the technical competence and experience of our field service engineers and their deployment of a broad portfolio of specialized tools and equipment. Our innovative and adaptive approach to proprietary tool design has been employed by our in-house research and development (“R&D”) organization and, in selected instances, by our technology partners to develop tools covered by 14 patents and 23 U.S. and foreign pending patent applications as well as 20 additional proprietary tools. Our technology partners include manufacturing and engineering companies that produce tools, which we design and utilize in our service offerings.

We utilize outside, dedicated manufacturers to produce our products, which, in many cases, our engineers have developed from the input and requests from our customers and customer-facing managers, thereby maintaining the integrity of our intellectual property while avoiding manufacturing startup and maintenance costs. We have found that doing so leverages our technical strengths as well as those of our technology partners. These services and related products, or PSLs, are modest in cost to the customer relative to its other well construction expenditures but have a high cost of failure and are, therefore, “mission critical” to our customers’ outcomes. We believe our customers have come to depend on our decades of combined field experience to execute on some of the most challenging problems they face. We believe we are well positioned as a company for continued growth, as the oil and gas industry continues to drill and complete thousands of increasingly complex wells each year and as thousands of older legacy wells require remediation.

KLX Energy Services was formed from the combination and integration of seven private oilfield service companies acquired over the 2013 through 2014 time period. Each of the acquired businesses was regional in nature and brought one or two specific service capabilities to KLX Energy Services. Once the acquisitions were completed, we undertook a comprehensive integration of these businesses, to align our services, our people and our assets across all the geographic regions where we maintain a presence. We established a matrix management organizational structure, where each regional manager has the resources to provide a complete suite of services, supported by technical experts in our primary service categories. In November 2018, we expanded our completion and intervention service offerings through the acquisition of Motley Services, LLC (“Motley”), a premier provider of large diameter coiled tubing, further enhancing our completion tools business. On March 15, 2019, the Company acquired Tecton Energy Services (“Tecton”), a leading provider of flowback, drill-out and production testing services, operating primarily in the greater Rocky Mountains. On March 19, 2019, the Company acquired Red Bone Services LLC (“Red Bone”), a premier provider of oilfield services primarily in the Mid-Continent, providing fishing, non-frac high pressure pumping, thru-tubing and certain other services. We have endeavored to create a “next generation” oilfield services company in terms of management controls, processes and operating metrics and have driven these processes down through the operating management structure in every region, which we believe differentiates us from many of our competitors. This allows us to offer our customers in all of our geographic regions discrete, comprehensive and differentiated services that leverage both the technical expertise of our skilled engineers and our in-house R&D team.
 Industry Overview

The oil and gas industry has historically been both cyclical and seasonal. Activity levels are driven primarily by drilling rig counts, technological advances, well completions and workover activity, the geological characteristics of the producing wells and their effect on the services required to commence and maintain production levels and our customers’ capital and operating budgets. All of these indicators are driven by commodity prices, which are affected by both domestic and global supply and demand factors. In particular, while U.S. natural gas prices are correlated with global oil price movements, they are also affected by local weather, transportation and consumption patterns.

While global supply and demand factors will continue to result in commodity price volatility, we believe the secular outlook for the onshore North American oil and gas industry remains positive due to the following trends and factors:

Growth in Onshore Unconventional Resources.  The development of new recovery technologies is leading to a shift toward the drilling and development of onshore unconventional oil and natural gas resources, which requires more wells to be drilled and active maintenance to sustain production and maximize recoveries. We believe the increased production requirements of these unconventional resources will continue to support increasing service activity as the industry rebalances its allocation of assets to meet future growth.

Numerous Technology Breakthroughs. Technologically driven breakthroughs, including (i) continued drilling activity supported by unconventional resources, (ii) the expanding use of horizontal drilling techniques and (iii) longer lateral lengths and the increasing number of stages per well, have created growing demand for top-level services and products to support these advanced drilling and completion activities, many of which take place in remote areas with harsh environments.

Increasing Complexity of Technology. The increasing complexity of technology used in the oil and natural gas exploration and development process requires additional technicians on location during the drilling and completion operations. In particular, the increasing trend of pursuing horizontal and directional wells as opposed to vertical wells requires additional expertise on location.

Large U.S. Oil and Gas Reserves. The United States is committed to a long-term goal of energy independence. Currently identified recoverable reserves of 303 billion barrels of shale oil and 2,459 trillion cubic feet of shale gas are contained within the United States, according to the EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2019 Assumptions report.

Growing Demand for Natural Gas in the United States. We believe that natural gas will be in increasingly high demand in the United States over time because of its growing popularity as a cleaner burning fuel. The ongoing shift to the use of natural gas from coal-fired power plants and increased access to residential customers from new pipeline projects are expected to support increased demand for natural gas. In addition, the recent commencement of liquefied natural gas shipments from the United States to foreign markets is also expected to increase demand for natural gas production.

Continued Outsourcing of Ancillary Services.  Almost all exploration and production (“E&P”) companies outsource the services required by them to drill wells and maintain production. Drilling and completion activities require numerous services and products from time to time on an “as needed” basis. Although some of the services we provide have historically been handled in-house by drilling contractors, in many instances drilling contractors will elect to outsource these services because these services are ancillary to the primary activity of drilling and completing wells and represent only a minor portion of the total well drilling cost. Drilling contractors that outsource these services look for suppliers who have the expertise to provide increasingly more complex, high-quality and reliable services on a 24/7 basis.  

Impact of Recent Industry Downturn. During the 2014 to mid-2016 industry downturn, the prices of oil and natural gas declined steeply, resulting in a dramatic reduction in drilling and completion activity by oil and gas producers in all regions of North America. Throughout all of 2015 and most of 2016, the oilfield services industry experienced a deep retrenchment where both capacity of services across the industry was cut and the pricing of services became deeply depressed. During this period, poorly capitalized businesses and many smaller competitors were unable to survive and went out of business. The industry began to see a stabilization in demand in late 2016, and with oil prices rising through the $40 per barrel range into the $60 per barrel range in 2017 and 2018, oil and gas producers renewed their commitment to their capital budgets, which resulted in a higher level of demand, improved pricing and a more stable operating environment for oilfield services businesses. Our operating earnings turned positive during the first quarter of Fiscal 2018 and remained positive through the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, excluding Costs as Defined, despite a precipitous 44% decline in oil prices between October and December 2018.
 Products and Services

We offer high value-added services and related tools and equipment supporting the completion, intervention and production activities of our customers in each of our geographic reporting segments. The principal services we offer to support our customers throughout the lifecycle of the well include completions, well intervention and production services and products.

Completions: Our completions activities are focused on services that help our customers drill, complete and stimulate extended reach horizontal laterals and more technical wellbores (the physical conduit from surface into the hydrocarbon reservoir). We are highly experienced in safely servicing deep, high-pressure, high-temperature wells in some of the most active onshore basins in the United States and provide premium perforating services for both wireline and tubing-conveyed applications. We believe we offer best-in-class service execution at the wellsite and innovative downhole technologies, positioning us to benefit from our ability to service the most technically complex wells where the potential for increased operating leverage is high due to the large number of stages per well in addition to customer focus on execution rather than price. We provide plug-and-perf wireline operations, wireline logging services, frac stack services and equipment, coiled tubing, flowback, high pressure blow out prevention (“BOP”) equipment and downhole completions tools.

Our completions activities include a wide range of services:

· | certified blow out preventers;

· | frac valve and flowback services;
--+----------------------------------


· | wireline services (including pump down and slick line);
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | well testing and nipple-up services;
--+-------------------------------------


· | downhole completion tools, including:
--+--------------------------------------

--+-------------------------------


· | downhole extended-reach technology;
--+------------------------------------


· | HAVOK™ motor bearing assembly; and
--+-----------------------------------


· | coiled tubing services.
--+------------------------

     
We believe our HAVOK™ motor bearing system together with an extended reach tool utilized under a cooperative marketing agreement complements our large diameter coiled tubing product service line in servicing extreme extended reach laterals. The extended reach tool reduces the friction drag and extends the lateral reach of the tubing by delaying the onset of helical buckling and lockup. We have successfully run this extended reach tool on numerous wells above our own proprietary HAVOK downhole motor, which boasts the industry’s only all-polycrystalline diamond compact bearing design. These tools have proven to be a formidable combination, delivering superior results for our customers. Further, we are successfully leveraging our coiled tubing assets to pull through our non-frac high pressure pumping, wireline, thru-tubing and certain other services.
    
We partnered with an engineering firm to co-develop a magnesium alloy based line of dissolvable plugs. Our proprietary dissolvable plugs deliver all the benefits of a traditional frac plug, but without the need for bottom hole intervention for removal. Our dissolvable plugs have been deployed in approximately 90 wells for approximately 30 customers with superior results compared to competitive products. Our plugs dissolve quickly and reliably, resulting in faster time to production, are effective in a wide range of operating temperatures and salinity, including temperatures ranging from 80 to 275 degrees Fahrenheit, and do not require mill out, thus saving time and cost.
    
The KLXE flotation collar is the only casing flotation system on the market that introduces zero debris into the wellbore and requires no specialized plug sets to operate. It is used in extended, horizontal applications to reduce friction forces and better allow the efficient construction of extended laterals. The KLXE flotation collar is designed to be simple, consistent and highly reliable in extended, horizontal applications.
    
A portion of our completion services is delivered by our fleet of wireline trucks and associated tools. We currently operate 75 wireline trucks, approximately 60% of which are configured to run pump down or plug-and-perf operations. Our R&D organization also enables our operations to support our customers with cutting edge pump down operations that include greaseless wireline, addressable gun systems and addressable release tools, to provide our customers with the highest quality pump down services. We also maintain a full line of radial cement bond tools, compensated neutron porosity tools and casing evaluation tools to provide well evaluation services to our clients. We also utilize greaseless line and quiet truck wireline technology to meet the environmental concerns of our customers in
 markets that require this technology.
    
While our company does not provide hydraulic fracturing (“frac”) services, we do provide equipment and services to support our customers’ hydraulic fracturing operations, including a number of proprietary tools that deliver both increased efficiency and safety. We offer a full line of valves and corresponding services to assist clients with their pressure control needs during fracturing operations. These valves are assembled in predetermined configurations based on customer preference and installed on the wellhead to control flow and pressure during fracturing operations. We currently have over 120 frac trees and 20 manifolds deployed and serving clients in all of our geographic regions. We
 own a large, young fleet of valves serving the North American onshore oil and gas market. We have enhanced our frac valve fleet line through the internal development of next generation technology, including our proprietary, patent pending frac relief valve (“FRV”). Introduced in 2016, the FRV was built and designed to replace older “pop-off” systems. When tied into a frac core (pumps), the FRV gives customers a safer and more reliable method for relieving surface pressure in the event of an unforeseen overpressure event. By doing this, we believe we minimize operational risk, as well as greatly reduce health, safety and environmental (“HSE”) concerns that are associated with fracturing
 operations.

Additional technologies that we currently deploy on behalf of our customers include our (i) patent pending floatation collar, which assists customers in getting completion (casing) to the bottom of extended reach wells when friction prevents getting casing to depth, (ii) proprietary IPA toe sleeve, which allows customers a consistent and reliable frac initiation sleeve at the toe of the completion, (iii) composite frac plug, a flow control device that is set in the wellbore at given intervals to divert fluid into the formation, and (iv) dissolvable plugs.
    
Wellbore Interventions: Our intervention services consist of best-in-class technicians and equipment that are focused on providing customers engineered solutions to downhole complications. Intervention involves the application of specialized tools and procedures to retrieve lost equipment and remove other obstructions that either interfere with the completion of the well or are causing diminished production. The principal services we provide to remediate these complications include fishing, thru-tubing and pipe recovery. Given the unique geology and operating characteristics of each well, no two complications are the same, yet each complication our customers experience results in substantial
 disruption to their well operation and economics. As a result, resolution is “mission critical” to our customers and supports premium pricing for superior outcomes. Those outcomes rely principally on the skill and experience of the technicians dedicated to resolving the issues and the availability of exactly the right tools for every eventuality. We believe we have one of the leading teams of intervention specialists in the industry, supported by a comprehensive portfolio of intervention tools and equipment. Each of our geographic regions is fully staffed with top technicians and fully equipped with a comprehensive range and quantity of equipment given the wellbore profiles for the region.
    
In November 2018, we acquired Motley, which is a premier provider of large diameter coiled tubing. Our coiled tubing product line is currently offered in our Southwest region, but it is expected to be rolled out to the Rocky Mountains and Northeast regions in response to customer requests during the course of 2019. We currently have a fleet of eight coiled tubing spreads and expect to take delivery and deploy a further seven spreads across our geographical regions during 2019.
    
We support our intervention group with a portfolio of tools consisting of both patented and proprietary technologies. Recent innovations currently deployed in the field include our: (i) DXD Venturi Tool; (ii) HAVOK PDC Bearing Section; (iii) Hydraulic By-Pass Tool; and (iv) Drill Mate (Mechanical By-Pass Valve). These tools were designed to improve upon conventional technology used by our competitors:
    
DXD Venturi Tool—The patent pending DXD (Debris Extraction Device) is an internally developed downhole tool that assists customers in removing unwanted debris from the wellbore. Utilizing fluid dynamics, the tool consists of a jet section that accelerates fluid across a nozzle. This increase in fluid velocity creates a pressure drop inside the tool, which draws fluid through an inlet. As the fluid is drawn into the system through the inlet, it picks up unwanted debris in the fluid flow, which is then caught in a series of chambers installed below the tool. The chambers then carry the debris out of the hole when the system is brought back to surface. 


HAVOK PDC Bearing Section—The patented HAVOK PDC is one of the most robust bearing packs on the market. With a total of five parts, this bearing pack has greatly reduced the operating cost of our thru-tubing motors and provides us with a significant differentiator in the thru-tubing market. We began deploying the bearing pack in early 2017 and have experienced excellent results with the tool.
    
Hydraulic By-Pass Tool—The patented hydraulic by-pass tool allows us to run our conventional motor assemblies and achieve substantially higher circulation rates without reducing the expected life of our conventional power section. The additional fluid being pumped and by-passed optimizes the downhole hydraulics for the operation and assists with proper debris removal.
    
Drill Mate (Mechanical By-Pass Valve)—The patented Drill Mate is a downhole tool that was developed to give customers a way to mechanically by-pass fluid during drill out or clean out operations. The tool is a two-piece system that opens and closes based upon the amount of weight being set on the mill or bit. During bottom milling with the tool, the tool is in the closed position, putting 100% of the flow through the motor BHA. As weight is removed from the mill or bit either by milling through the obstruction or picking up off bottom, the tool strokes open, thereby exposing by-pass ports that divert fluid through them. At this point, a customer can increase the amount of fluid being pumped through the BHA to assist in debris removal. This increase in fluid 

 
  8

 
rate does not affect the life of the motor as the additional fluid is by-passed through the Drill Mate tool.
    
Production Solutions: We also provide services to enhance and maintain oil and gas production throughout the productive lives of our customers’ wells. Our production services include maintenance related intervention services as well as the provision of specifically required products and equipment. As with our completion and intervention service offerings, we have developed a portfolio of proprietary tools that we believe differentiates our production solutions service offering. The principal services and equipment we provide across the production lifecycle of the well include (i) production BOPs, (ii) the provision of mechanical wireline services, (iii) slick line services, (iv) hydro-testing, (v) premium tubulars and (vi) other specialized production tools.
    
We believe our proprietary production tool portfolio creates a distinct competitive advantage for us in selling all of our production services. Key downhole production tools we have developed and that have been deployed with strong customer adoption include:
    
Punch Ram Tool—The punch ram tool gives customers the ability to safely and repeatedly release trapped pressure inside production tubulars during pulling operations. The alternative is to “hot-tap” the tubing, which is a high-risk operation that most operators are not willing to employ.
    
Frac Protect Rod Hang Off Tool—This tool is developed to give customers the ability to “hang off” a rod string rather than tripping it out of the hole and laying it down. The associated costs of tripping rods out of the hole coupled with the damage of laying them down and picking the string back up make this tool an excellent alternative option for customers. The hang off tool allows an operator to easily hang the rod string in the wellhead and still gives them the ability to tie into the tubing if need be to monitor pressure or pump fluid.
     Customers and Marketing
 Substantially all of our customers are engaged in the energy industry. Most of our sales are to regional, independent and major oil and gas companies, and these sales have resulted in a diversified and geographically balanced portfolio of more than 700 customers within North America. Revenues from our five largest customers collectively represented approximately 23% of our revenues in Fiscal 2018.
 Our sales activities are conducted through a network of sales representatives and business development personnel, which provide coverage at both the corporate and field customer level. Sales representatives work closely with local operations managers to target potential opportunities through strategic focus and planning. Customers are identified as targets based on their drilling and completion activity, geographic location and economic viability. Direction of the sales team is conducted through weekly meetings and daily communication. Our marketing activities are performed internally. Our strategy is based on building a strong North American brand though multiple media outlets including our website, select social media accounts, print, billboard advertisements, press releases and various industry-specific conferences, publications and lectures. We have a technical sales organization with expertise and focus within their specific service line. We focus on organic growth through selling of services and marketing excellence through brand service quality, technology and metrics of success. We accomplish this through communication across sales and operations departments and regions to share best practices and leverage existing customer relationships.
 Competition
 We provide services and products and compete in a variety of distinct sub-segments with a number of competitors. Our primary competitors are regional companies, which provide a more limited range of services and equipment and often have more limited financial resources to support their operations. With respect to certain of our services, we also compete with major, multinational companies, including Superior Energy Services, Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Weatherford. Competition is based on a number of factors, including performance, safety, quality, reliability, service, price, response time and, increasingly, breadth of services and products. We maintain both regional and product/services specialist sales teams. Although sales employees tend to be based locally in regions and field locations, we have established a corporate sales team to coordinate sales and marketing efforts with our key accounts. As of January 31, 2019, we had 26 corporate sales representatives and 65 regional sales representatives with an 

 
  9

 
average of over 10 years of experience. Additionally, projects are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to create a highly competitive environment. We seek to differentiate our company from our competitors by delivering a broad range of non-frac services with the highest-quality equipment and highly competent personnel, which enables us to deliver superior execution and operating efficiency in a safe working environment. By focusing on cultivating our existing customer relationships and maintaining our high standard of customer service, technology, safety, performance and quality of crews, equipment and services, we believe we are equipped for continued growth and success in a competitive market.
 Suppliers and Procurement
 We purchase a wide variety of materials, components and partially completed and finished products from manufacturers and suppliers for our use. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies, materials or equipment. To date, we have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or products by one of our suppliers, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements. In addition, certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future. As a result, we may be unable to mitigate any future supply shortages and our results of operations, prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected. Customer Service
 We are highly differentiated in each of the geographic markets that we serve with our services and associated product offerings. This is achieved by providing targeted, complementary services and related products and being responsive to our customers with both quality, as measured by the industry-standard NPT, and timely responses to any request. The key elements include:
· | 24-hours a day, seven days a week operations;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | recognized industry leading technicians in our principal service and product lines;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | responsiveness to our customers’ requirements for ready-to-deploy API certified equipment and a “can do” philosophy;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | technical interface with customers via product line management personnel; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | client intimacy.
--+-----------------

      Technology and Intellectual Property
    
Our engineering and technology efforts are focused on providing efficient and cost-effective solutions to maximize production for our customers across major North American onshore basins. We have dedicated resources focused on the internal development of new technology and equipment, as well as resources focused on sourcing and commercializing new technologies through strategic relationships. Our sales and earnings are influenced by our ability to successfully introduce new or improved products and services to the market.
    
Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent, license or strategic relationship as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities, customer service oriented culture and application of our know-how to distinguish ourselves from our competitors, rather than our right to exclude others through patents or exclusive licenses. We also consider the quality and timely delivery of our products, the service we provide to our customers, and the technical knowledge and skill of our personnel to be more important than our registered intellectual property in our ability to compete.
    
We believe we have become a “go-to” service provider for piloting certain new technologies across North America because of our service quality, execution at the wellsite and scale. These strategic relationships provide us and our customers with access to unique technology from independent innovators. This also allows us to minimize exposure to potential technology adoption risks and the significant costs associated with developing and implementing R&D internally. Our internal resources are focused on evolving our existing proprietary tools to stay on trend and ensure 

 
  10

 
quicker, lower completion and production costs for our customers.
     Risk Management and Insurance
    
The provision of technical services or use of certain of our tools and equipment in connection therewith could involve operational risk and thereby expose us to liabilities. An accident involving our services or equipment, or the failure of a product, could result in personal injury, loss of life and damage to property, equipment or the environment. Damages from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a fire or explosion, could result in substantial claims for damages. We generally attempt to negotiate the terms of our MSAs consistent with industry practice. In general, we attempt to take responsibility for our own personnel and property, while our customers, such as the E&P companies and well operators, take responsibility for their own personnel, property and all liabilities arising from well and subsurface operations.
    
In addition, claims for loss of oil and gas production and damage to formations can occur in the oilfield services industry. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. Because our business involves the transportation of heavy equipment and materials, we may also experience traffic accidents, which may result in spills, property damage and personal injury.
    
Oilfield services companies, despite efforts to maintain high safety standards, from time to time, have suffered accidents. Our business is subject to the same risks and, as a result, there is a risk that we will experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property and personal losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability, and our relationship with customers, employees and regulatory agencies. In particular, in recent years many of our large customers have placed an increased emphasis on the safety records of their service providers. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensatory payments, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
    
We maintain a risk management program that covers operating hazards, including products and completed operations, property damage and personal injury claims as well as certain limited environmental claims. Our risk management program includes primary, umbrella and excess umbrella liability policies of $77 million per occurrence, including sudden and accidental pollution claims. We believe that our insurance is sufficient to cover property and casualty liability claims.
    
We endeavor to allocate potential liabilities and risks between the parties in our MSAs. We retain the risk for any liability not indemnified by our customers and in excess of our insurance coverage. These MSAs delineate our and our customers’ respective warranty and indemnification obligations with respect to the services we provide. We endeavor to negotiate MSAs with our customers that provide, among other things, that we and our customers assume (without regard to fault) liability for damages to our respective personnel and property. For catastrophic losses, we endeavor to negotiate MSAs that include industry-standard carve-outs from the knock-for-knock indemnities. Additionally, our MSAs often provide carve-outs to the “without regard to fault” concept that would permit, for example, us to be held responsible for events of catastrophic loss only if they arise as a result of our gross negligence or willful misconduct. Our MSAs typically provide for industry-standard pollution indemnities, pursuant to which we assume liability for surface pollution associated with our equipment and originating above the surface (without regard to fault), and our customer assumes (without regard to fault) liability arising from all other pollution, including, without limitation, underground pollution and pollution emanating from the wellbore as a result of an explosion, fire or blowout. The summary of MSAs set forth above is a summary of the material terms of the typical MSA that we have in place and does not reflect every MSA that we have entered into or may enter into in the future, some of which may contain indemnity structures and risk allocations between our customers and us that are different than those described here. 
     Information Technology
    
During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, we successfully completed the integration of the Motley business onto our company-wide financial accounting platform, which utilizes a Microsoft-based enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system together with industry leading asset management software “TrakQuip”. These IT systems provide us with a 

 
  11

 
scalable integrated platform that facilitates highly efficient operations, consolidated invoicing and optimal equipment utilization on both a site and segment basis. Our operating strategy is based upon balancing high asset and personnel utilization levels with consistently superior customer service. As such, our IT systems are integral to effectively managing our business. 
     Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
    
Our operations are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations establishing health, safety and environmental quality standards, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water and the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We may be subject to liabilities or penalties for violations of those regulations. We are also subject to laws and regulations, such as the Federal Superfund Law and similar state statutes, governing remediation of contamination, which could occur or might have occurred at facilities that we own or operate, or which we formerly owned or operated, or to which we send or have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. We believe that we are currently compliant, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, we could become subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability relating to our facilities or operations.
    
The following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject.
     Hazardous substances and waste handling
    
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the guidance issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. We are required to manage the disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes in compliance with RCRA and analogous state laws. RCRA currently exempts many E&P wastes from classification as hazardous waste. Specifically, RCRA excludes from the definition of hazardous waste produced waters and other wastes intrinsically associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil and natural gas. However, these oil and gas E&P wastes may still be regulated under state solid waste laws and regulations, and it is possible that certain oil and natural gas E&P wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous waste in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain E&P related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes rulemaking for revised oil and gas regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Stricter regulation of wastes generated during our or our customers’ operations could result in increased costs for our operations or the operations of its customers, which could in turn reduce demand for our services and adversely affect our business. 
     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
    
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and former owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA and any state analogs may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, and for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for manufacturing and other operations for many years. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such 

 
  12

 
laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
     Worker health and safety
    
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) establishing requirements to protect the health and safety of workers. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of this information to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regulates and provides safety oversight of commercial motor vehicles, the EPA establishes requirements to protect human health and the environment, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives establishes requirements for the safe use and storage of explosives, and the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission establishes requirements for the protection against ionizing radiation. Substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with these laws and regulations.
     Transportation safety and compliance
    
Operating a fleet of over 1,000 vehicles, we are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and Hazardous Material Regulations for Interstate travel, and comparable state regulations for Intrastate travel. Substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles.
     Water discharges
    
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. In September 2015, a new EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) rule defining the scope of federal jurisdiction over wetlands and other waters became effective (the “Clean Water Rule”). The Clean Water Rule was previously stayed nationwide to determine whether federal district or appellate courts had jurisdiction to hear cases challenging the rule. The EPA and the Corps issued a proposed rulemaking in June 2017 to repeal the Clean Water Rule, and announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction. In January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction resides with the federal district courts to hear challenges to the Clean Water Rule; following which, the previously-filed district court cases have been allowed to proceed. Following the Supreme Court’s decision, the EPA and the Corps issued a final rule in January 2018 staying implementation of the 2015 rule for two years while the agencies reconsider the rule. Subsequent litigation has resulted in some states applying the rule while others do not. In December 2018, the EPA and the Corps issued a revised rule proposal that would provide discrete categories of jurisdictional waters and tests for determining whether a particular water body meets any of those classifications. Several groups have already announced their intentions to challenge the proposed rule. To the extent the rule expands the range of properties subject to the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, certain energy companies could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas, which in turn could reduce demand for our services. The process for obtaining permits has the potential to delay our operations and those of our customers. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters by a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous 

 
  13

 
state laws and regulations. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges.
     Air emissions
    
The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”), and comparable state laws, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. These regulations change frequently. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. For example, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements. In addition, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion and completed attainment/non-attainment designations in July 2018. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, which in turn could delay or impair our or our customers’ ability to obtain air emission permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive relief, for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations.
     Climate change
    
The EPA has determined that emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, present a danger to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. The EPA has established greenhouse gas emission reporting requirements for sources in the oil and gas sector, and has also promulgated rules requiring certain large stationary sources of greenhouse gases to obtain preconstruction permits under the CAA and follow “best available control technology” requirements. Although we are not likely to become subject to greenhouse gas emissions permitting and best available control technology requirements because none of our facilities are presently major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such requirements could become applicable to our customers and could have an adverse effect on their costs of operations or financial performance, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and many states already have established regional greenhouse gas “cap-and-trade” programs. The adoption of any legislation or regulation that restricts emissions of greenhouse gases from the equipment and operations of our customers or with respect to the oil and natural gas they produce could adversely affect demand for our products and services. Finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that could have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events; if such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse impact on our operations.
     Hydraulic fracturing
    
Our businesses are dependent on our customers’ hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling activities. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels. In 2016, the EPA issued final 

 
  14

 
regulations under the CAA establishing performance standards, including standards for the capture of methane emissions released during hydraulic fracturing. In June 2017, the EPA proposed to stay the requirements for a period of two years and revisit implementation of the 2016 methane standards in their entirety. In September 2018, the EPA proposed amendments to relax or rescind certain of the 2016 standards. Various industry and environmental groups have separately challenged both the methane requirements and the EPA’s attempts to delay implementation of the rule. The Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”) previously finalized similar limitations on methane emissions from venting and flaring and leaking equipment from oil and natural gas activities on public lands, but in September 2018, the BLM issued a rule that rescinds or relaxes certain of these limitations. California and New Mexico have challenged the rule in ongoing litigation. As a result, future implementation of both the EPA and BLM methane rules is uncertain at this time. However, given the long-term trend towards increasing regulation, future federal regulation of methane and other greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and gas industry remain a possibility.
    
The EPA has also issued effluent limitation guidelines that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly-owned wastewater treatment plants. In addition, the BLM had previously issued final rules in March 2015 imposing stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Native American lands; however, the agency finalized a separate rulemaking in December 2017 repealing its hydraulic fracturing rules. Several states and environmental groups have challenged the repeal in federal court. It is unclear how any additional federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities may affect our operations, but additional regulatory burdens on our customers could ultimately result in decreased demand for our services.
    
Various studies analyzing the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing have also been performed. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources “under some circumstances,” noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. As described elsewhere in this Annual Report, these risks are regulated under various state, federal, and local laws.
    
Some states, counties and municipalities have enacted or are considering moratoria on hydraulic fracturing. For example, New York has banned the use of high volume hydraulic fracturing. Alternatively, some municipalities are or have considered zoning and other ordinances, the conditions of which could impose a de facto ban on drilling and/or hydraulic fracturing operations. Further, some states, counties and municipalities are closely examining water use issues, such as permit and disposal options for processed water, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, prospects and results of operations if such additional permitting requirements are imposed upon our industry. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could reduce our business by making it more difficult or costly for their customers to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA, the business and operations of our customers could be subject to additional permitting requirements, and also to attendant permitting delays, increased operating and compliance costs and process prohibitions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
