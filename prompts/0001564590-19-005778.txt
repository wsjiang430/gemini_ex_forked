Item 1. | BUSINESS
---------+---------

General 
 Hub Group, Inc. (the “Company”, “Hub”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a leading, world class supply chain management company that provides value-added multi-modal transportation and logistics solutions by offering reliability, visibility and value to our customers. Our service offerings include comprehensive intermodal, truck brokerage, dedicated trucking, managed transportation, freight consolidation, warehousing, international transportation and other logistics services. The Company is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on March 8, 1995 as successor to a business that was founded in 1971. 
 Today we are one of the largest freight transportation providers in the United States. Through our network, we have the ability to arrange for the movement of freight in and out of every major city in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We utilize an asset-light strategy that employs a combination of our company-operated equipment as well as assets operated by third parties to transport and store our customers’ goods, which allows us to minimize our investment in equipment and facilities and reduce our capital requirements. Hub services a large and diversified customer base in a broad range of industries, including consumer products, retail and durable goods.  We believe our strategy to offer multi-modal supply chain management solutions serves to strengthen and deepen our relationships with our customers and allows us to provide a more cost effective and higher service solution.
 Our strategy includes the following elements:
  
• | Deepen and diversify our customer relationships through a best-in-class customer experience across all solutions
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acquire and organically develop new service offerings for our customers that will diversify our revenue streams and deliver sophisticated supply chain logistics solutions
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively invest in assets to drive organic growth and reduce our costs
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build a world class information technology platform to drive growth and efficiency and support future innovation
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop a culture that continues to enable innovation, service and teamwork
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In support of our mission to provide multi-modal transportation and logistics solutions we regularly evaluate strategic transactions to enhance our core business lines and diversify our service offerings.  Our recent strategic transactions include the following:
 Estenson Acquisition.  On July 1, 2017, our subsidiary Hub Group Trucking, Inc. (“HGT”), acquired the outstanding equity interests of Estenson Logistics, LLC (“Estenson”), a leading North American dedicated trucking company that operated over 1,000 trucks and employed approximately 1,300 drivers.  Estenson now operates under the name Hub Group Dedicated (“Dedicated”).  
 Mode Sale.  On August 31, 2018, we sold the membership interests of our Mode Transportation, LLC (“Mode”) subsidiary to an affiliate of York Capital Management (“Purchaser”).  Mode’s temperature protected division (“Temstar”) was not included in the transaction and is now included in our intermodal line of business.   Mode provided transportation management services to its customers through a network of approximately 170 agents.  
 CaseStack Acquisition.  On December 3, 2018, a subsidiary of Hub Group, Inc. completed a merger with CaseStack, Inc. (“CaseStack”).  CaseStack is a non-asset based transportation and logistics provider operating in two lines of business.  CaseStack’s logistics business provides warehouse and transportation logistics services, including retailer-driven collaborative consolidation programs, to its customers who primarily consist of consumer-packaged goods companies selling into the North American retail channel. CaseStack’s transportation brokerage business offers truck brokerage services with a focus on less-than-truckload services.  CaseStack does not own or operate any warehouses or transportation equipment. The financial results of CaseStack are included in our logistics line of business, except for their transportation brokerage business which is included in our truck brokerage line of business. 
 Services Provided

Our lines of business can be categorized as follows: 
 Intermodal. As an intermodal provider, we arrange for the movement of our customers’ freight in containers and trailers, typically over long distances of 750 miles or more. We contract with railroads to provide transportation for the long-haul portion of the shipment between rail terminals.  Local pickup and delivery services between origin or destination and rail terminals (referred to as “drayage”) are provided by our HGT subsidiary and third-party local trucking companies.  
 In a typical intermodal transaction, the customer contacts Hub to place an order. We determine the price, arrange for the necessary intermodal equipment (which includes a container and chassis or a trailer) to be delivered to the customer by HGT or a third-party drayage company and, after the freight is loaded, arrange for the transportation of the container or trailer to the rail terminal where it is transported by the railroad to the destination rail terminal. Our predictive track and trace technology then monitors the shipment to ensure that it arrives as scheduled and alerts our customer service personnel if there are service delays. We then arrange for and confirm delivery by a drayage company at the destination. After unloading, the empty equipment is made available for reloading. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 37,000 53-foot containers and we had exclusive access to approximately 1,200 rail-owned containers for our dedicated use on the Union Pacific (“UP”) and the Norfolk Southern (“NS”) railroads. 
 During 2018, HGT accounted for approximately 53% of Hub’s drayage needs by providing reliable, cost effective intermodal services to our customers. As of December 31, 2018, HGT had terminals in the Atlanta, Birmingham, Charlotte, Chattanooga, Chicago, Dallas, Harrisburg, Huntsville, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Kalamazoo, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Memphis, Nashville, Newark, Philadelphia, Portland (OR), Salt Lake City, Seattle, St. Louis, Stockton and Wilmington (IL) metro areas. As of December 31, 2018, HGT leased or owned approximately 1,200 tractors and 200 trailers, employed approximately 1,300 drivers and contracted with approximately 1,300 owner-operators. 
 Dedicated Trucking. Our dedicated operation contracts with customers who seek to outsource a portion of their trucking transportation needs. We offer a dedicated fleet of equipment and drivers to each customer, as well as the management and infrastructure to operate according to the customer’s high service expectations. Contracts with customers generally include fixed and variable pricing arrangements and may include charges for early termination which serves to reduce the financial risk we bear with respect to the utilization of our equipment.  Our dedicated operation currently operates a fleet of approximately 1,400 tractors and 4,500 trailers at 130 locations throughout the United States.  As of December 31, 2018, Dedicated employed approximately 1,900 drivers.
 Truck Brokerage. We operate one of the largest truck brokerage operations in the U.S., providing customers with an over the road service option for their transportation needs. Our brokerage does not operate any trucks; instead we match customers’ needs with carriers’ capacity to provide the most effective service and price combination. We have contracts with a substantial base of carriers allowing us to meet the varied needs of our customers. 
 In a typical truck brokerage transaction, the customer contacts Hub to obtain a price quote for a particular freight movement. We make the delivery appointment and arrange with the appropriate carrier to pick up the freight. Once we receive confirmation that the freight has been picked up, we monitor the movement of the shipment until it reaches its destination and the delivery has been confirmed. 
 In 2018, we expanded our truck brokerage service offering through the acquisition of CaseStack. CaseStack’s truck brokerage provides us with additional capabilities, particularly with respect to less-than-truckload freight. 
 Logistics. Hub’s logistics business operates under the names Unyson Logistics and CaseStack. Unyson Logistics is comprised of a network of logistics professionals dedicated to developing, implementing and operating customized logistics solutions for customers. Unyson Logistics offers a wide range of transportation management services and technology solutions including shipment optimization, load consolidation, mode selection, carrier management, load planning and execution and web-based shipment visibility. Our multi-modal transportation capabilities include small parcel, heavyweight, expedited, less-than-truckload, truckload, intermodal, railcar and international shipping. Our CaseStack logistics business leverages proprietary technology along with collaborative partnerships with retailers and logistics providers to deliver cost savings and performance-enhancing supply chain services to consumer-packaged goods clients.  CaseStack contracts with third-party warehouse providers in seven markets across North America to which its customers ship their goods to be stored and eventually consolidated, along with goods from other CaseStack customers, into full truckload shipments destined to major North American retailers.  CaseStack offers its customers shipment visibility, transportation cost savings, high service and compliance with retailers’ increasingly stringent supply chain requirements.
Marketing and Customers 
 As one of the leading transportation management companies in North America, Hub Group’s mission is to be a world-class supply chain management company that provides innovative, value-added multi-modal solutions including intermodal, dedicated trucking,

truck brokerage and logistics services.  We have transformed our organization from a traditional intermodal marketing company (“IMC”) into a multi-modal solutions provider delivering reliability, visibility and value to our customers every day. 
 The focus on this mission has revolutionized our offerings and the way we service our customers.  We seek to understand and analyze our customers’ entire network to provide innovative multi-modal solutions to drive savings, improve service and offer full visibility into their supply chains.
After 48 years in business, we continue to live by the simple mantra that "good" is not good enough. To ensure we grow and improve, we focus intently on our customers, listening to their needs, developing comprehensive transportation solutions and delivering superior service. We invest in our people, equipment and technology to maintain our competitive edge in order to be the best transportation provider for our customers.
 The supply-chain needs of our customers have become more complex, efficient and lean. We are committed to helping our customers meet these needs. A particular focus has been providing our customers with increased speed and improved visibility into their supply chains.  Our state-of-the-art technology and satellite tracking of intermodal containers helps to maintain our high levels of service while aiding capacity planning and providing 24/7 visibility into any shipment; and our people have the skills, training and information to quickly respond to our customers' changing supply chain networks. Every customer has a dedicated team of professionals ready to service all of their needs. We refer to this exceptional service approach the "One Hub" experience.
 The majority of our business is in the retail, consumer products and durable goods.  No one customer represents more than 10% of our total revenue in 2018 and 2017.  
 Information Technology Systems 
 Leveraging strong technology at the core and emerging technologies on the edge to achieve our business goals and to keep pace with customer demands remains the basis of our technology strategy.  We purchase commercially available technology for commodity capabilities, we extend to create additional value leveraging emerging technologies, and we build solutions where we can create differentiated experiences for our customers, drivers, carriers and employees.  In 2018 we initiated our multi-year investment and process enhancement initiative that we refer to as “Elevate” which includes implementing core foundational technologies, Oracle enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) and Oracle Human Capital Management (“HCM”) and Oracle Transportation Management (“OTM”) all of which are deployed in the cloud.  Anchored on those common platforms our technology strategy includes the deployment of differentiating solutions facing our customers and carriers through our Hub Connect application and for our drivers through our Hub Pro application.  In addition, we have many initiatives focused on internal productivity and efficiency that will be a dramatic change from the processes and technology used today.
 In 2018, we converted two of our HGT terminals to our newly designed process and technology solutions for fleet operations.  This included changes to the technology used for the recruiting, qualifying, and onboarding of drivers.  This allows drivers to immediately begin using the entire suite of solutions on their first day of employment.  We also deployed our state-of-the-art transportation management system, OTM, allowing us to optimally plan drivers and loads.  This positively impacts both driver and asset utilization while improving the customer experience with more efficient, responsive operations.  This deployment also added a significant set of capabilities to Hub Pro, our mobile solution for company drivers and owner operator drivers.   These new capabilities include visibility to work assignments, direct communication to their manager, verification of work completed, hours of service compliance, vehicle inspection and other features focused on value to our drivers.  This end to end solution was deployed leveraging both purchased and custom-built solutions integrated through our API platform. The deployment of this solution to each of our fleet terminals will be completed by the end of 2019.
 Benefits of our Cloud First technology strategy include improvements to the rate and pace at which we can deliver technology solutions, while lowering the cost to serve and maintaining our high level of service quality. We also expect to deploy in 2019 ERP as our financial management solution as well as enabling HCM Cloud for driver payroll allowing us to leverage both solutions to improve efficiency and gain valuable insight. These and other new technology solutions are planned for 2019.
Relationship with Railroads 
 A key element of our business strategy is to strengthen our close working relationships with the major intermodal railroads in North America. Due to our size and relative importance, some railroads have dedicated support personnel to focus on our day-to-day service requirements. On a regular basis, our senior executives and each of the railroads meet to discuss major strategic issues concerning intermodal transportation.

We have relationships with each of the following major railroads: 
 
 
Burlington Northern Santa Fe | Florida East Coast 
-----------------------------+---------------------
Canadian National | Kansas City Southern
Canadian Pacific | Norfolk Southern 
CSX | Union Pacific 
Ferromex | 

Relationship with Drayage Companies 
 Hub has a “Quality Drayage Program,” under which participants commit to provide high quality drayage service along with clean and safe equipment, maintain a defined on-time performance level and follow specified procedures designed to minimize freight loss and damage. We negotiate drayage rates for transportation between specific origin and destination points. 
 We also provide drayage services with our own drayage operations, which we operate through our subsidiary HGT. Our drayage operations employ their own drivers and also contract with owner-operators who supply their own trucks. 
 Relationship with Trucking Companies 
 We contract with a large number of trucking companies that we use to transport freight. Our relationships with these trucking companies are important since these relationships determine pricing, load coverage and overall service. 
Risk Management and Insurance 
 We require all of our trucking company vendors to carry general liability insurance, truckman’s auto liability insurance and cargo insurance. Railroads, which are self-insured, provide limited cargo protection. To cover freight loss or damage when a carrier’s liability cannot be established or a carrier’s insurance is insufficient to cover the claim, we carry our own cargo insurance. We also carry general liability insurance with a companion umbrella policy on this general liability insurance.
We maintain separate insurance policies to cover potential exposure from our company-owned drayage and dedicated operations. We carry commercial general liability insurance subject to a policy aggregate limit, and trucker’s automobile liability insurance with a limit per occurrence. Additionally, we have an umbrella excess liability policy and maintain motor truck cargo liability insurance.
 Government Regulation 
 The Company and several of our subsidiaries, including Dedicated and CaseStack, are licensed by the Department of Transportation as brokers in arranging for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle. To the extent that we perform truck brokerage services, they do so under these licenses. The Department of Transportation prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity, including a $75,000 surety bond that we have posted. In addition, Hub has customs bonds. To date, compliance with these regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition; however, the transportation industry is subject to legislative or regulatory changes that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and cost of providing, transportation services. 
Custom-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism 
 One of our operating subsidiaries achieved Custom-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) certification in 2013 and have maintained it since then. C-TPAT is a voluntary supply chain security program led by U.S. Customs and Border Protection focused on improving the security of private companies’ supply chains with respect to terrorism. Companies who achieve C-TPAT certification must have a documented process for determining and alleviating risks throughout their international supply chain. This certification allows us to be considered low risk, resulting in expedited processing of our customers’ cargo, including fewer customs examinations. 
Competition 
 The transportation services industry is highly competitive. We compete against intermodal providers, as well as logistics companies, third party brokers, trucking companies and railroads that market their own services. Several larger trucking companies have entered into agreements with railroads to market intermodal services nationwide. Competition is based primarily on freight rates, quality of service, reliability, transit time and scope of operations. Several transportation service companies and trucking companies, and all of the major railroads, may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do.
