ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview and History
 
We are a minerals company in the business of acquiring and advancing mineral properties to the discovery point, where we believe maximum shareholder returns can be realized. Although we have conducted limited extraction of gold on one of our gold prospects, Goldrich is an exploration stage company as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Subpart 1300), although over $50 million in revenue from gold has been extracted from its claims since 2015.
 
Incorporated in 1959, Goldrich Mining Company (OTCQB trading symbol GRMC) has been a publicly traded company since October 9, 1970. Our executive offices are located at 2525 E. 29th Ave. Ste. 10B-160, Spokane, WA 99223, and our phone number there is (509) 535-7367. Our website address is www.goldrichmining.com. Information contained on our website is not part of this annual report.
 
At this time, our major mineral exploration prospects are contained within our wholly-owned Chandalar property, located approximately 190 air miles north of Fairbanks, Alaska. The property is largely on land owned by the State of Alaska, which is one of the active and highly ranked mining jurisdictions in the world. Both patented federal mining claims and Alaska state mining claims provide exploration and mining rights to lode and placer mineral deposits. A more detailed description of our Chandalar property is set forth in Item 2 – Properties of this Annual Report.
 
The Chandalar property contains both our Chandalar hard-rock (lode) gold project, our primary target, and the Chandalar alluvial gold mine. The area has a long prospecting and mining history dating to the discovery of placer gold deposits in 1905, soon followed by the discovery of more than 30 separate high-grade lode gold mineralization prospects. Over the next 80 years the lode gold mineralization occurrences were intermittently explored or mined by various small operators, but because of the districts remote location the readily mineable alluvial gold deposits received the most attention.
 
Although there is a history of past lode and alluvial extraction on our Chandalar property, it currently does not contain any known proven or probable ore reserves as defined in Subpart 1300. The probability that ore reserves that meet SEC Subpart 1300 guidelines will be discovered on an individual hard rock prospect at Chandalar cannot be determined at this time. We commissioned an independent engineering firm to complete a mining plan and initial assessment for the Companys Chandalar placer mine, completed in June 2021, according to the new amendments adopted by the SEC to modernize the property disclosure requirements for mining registrants as codified in Subpart 1300. The new disclosure requirements under Subpart 1300 replaced the SEC Industry Guide 7, and mining registrants on January 1, 2021. The new disclosure requirements under Subpart 1300 allow issuers to disclose inferred, indicated and measured resources as defined therein. Subject to the findings of Companys initial assessment, we will decide if a preliminary feasibility study should also be prepared for the Chandalar placer mine. A preliminary feasibility study allows an issuer to disclose any proven or probable mineral reserves on a mineral property.
 
The ownership and management of Goldrich changed in 2003. Beginning in 2004, we ended a twenty-year hiatus of hard-rock exploration on the property and began employing modern exploration techniques. Our focus is two-fold: 
 
(1) Continue exploration of our Chandalar property where we have discovered and identified drilling targets for a potentially large bulk tonnage hard-rock intrusion-related gold deposit.
 
(2) Continue gold extraction from the Chandalar placer gold deposit discovered on the property.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS

  We have spent many millions of dollars in exploration and mining activities at our Chandalar property. Some of the highlights include (see details of highlights in the Properties section below):
 
2012: As described below in Joint Venture Agreement, we signed an agreement with NyacAU to form a joint venture, Goldrich NyacAU Placer, LLC (GNP) for the purpose of mining the alluvial gold deposits within the bounds of our Chandalar property.
 
2013: Achievements included GNPs mobilization of drilling equipment and plant setup, approval of permits to expand mining operations, significant infrastructure improvements and extraction of 680 ounces of fine gold.
 
2014: We conducted a property-wide airborne radiometric and magnetic survey to generate and further refine exploration targets for bulk-tonnage low-grade mineralization and possible deeper sources of intrusion-related mineralization. We also completed advanced petrographic studies of drill core samples from the Chandalar gold property. The new data refined the orogenic model that has historically guided exploration at Chandalar and redirected our future exploration for intrusion-related mineralization.
 
2015: We completed reclamation of a mine waste road built in 2010 and received a confirmation of completion and satisfaction from the Army Corps of Engineers. GNP extracted approximately 3,600 ounces of fine gold.
 
2016: GNP extracted approximately 8,200 ounces of fine gold.
 
2017: We performed additional oxygen isotope studies to further confirm intrusion-related mineralization. In addition, GNP completed a sonic drill program and drilled 231 holes totaling 14,271 feet to further define the Chandalar placer deposit. GNP extracted approximately 12,300 ounces of fine gold. 
 
2018: GNP extracted approximately 17,100 ounces of fine gold.
 
2019 - 2021: GNP was dissolved in 2019 due to its inability to reach commercial production, and no mining activities were undertaken in 2019, 2020, and 2021.
 
Although GNP extracted over 42,000 ounces of fine gold from 2013 to 2018, GNP failed to meet the minimum production requirements under the GNP Operating Agreement. Goldrich began arbitration proceedings against NyacAU and certain NyacAU related parties in 2017 (see Joint Venture Agreement and Arbitration below). GNP was dissolved in June 2019 and is in the late stages of the process of liquidation. Except for equipment needed for reclamation, most of the heavy equipment and the wash plant were removed in March through mid-April 2019. There was no gold extracted in 2019, 2020, and 2021. NyacAU is the holder of the mine permits and began reclamation of the mine in 2019. NyacAU is responsible for future reclamation costs. Goldrich hired an independent mining engineering firm in 2019 to formulate a mine plan and complete an initial assessment under Subpart 1300 to determine if Goldrich should pursue production at the placer mine. The mine plan and initial assessment were completed in June 2021. Any plan to continue future mining is contingent upon our success in raising sufficient capital to fund these activities or any portion of them (see Joint Venture Agreement below for details of the GNP joint venture, arbitration activities and the joint ventures pending liquidation).
 
Concerning hard-rock exploration, although we are pleased with the progress that has been made, weak financial markets during the last several years have been an important factor affecting the level of our exploration activities. If the placer mine enters into commercial production (by Goldrich or a third-party operator), we look forward to potential internal cash flow and additional opportunities for financing that will give us a unique advantage for growth over other junior mining exploration companies; however, finances must be obtained before we can continue mining activities.
 
We also intend to list our shares on a recognized stock exchange in Canada in addition to maintaining our quotation on the OTCQB in the United States. We believe these factors will increase our access to financial markets and positively affect our ability to raise the funds necessary to add value to our property and increase shareholder value. Our main focus in the future will continue to be the exploration of the hard-rock targets of our Chandalar property as funds become available.

  Competition
 
There is aggressive competition within the minerals industry to discover and acquire mineral properties considered to have commercial potential. We compete for the opportunity to participate in promising exploration projects with other entities. In addition, we compete with others in efforts to obtain financing to acquire and explore mineral properties, acquire and utilize mineral exploration equipment and hire qualified mineral exploration personnel.
 
We may compete with other junior mining companies for mining claims in regions adjacent to our existing claims, or in other parts of the world should we dedicate resources to doing so in the future. These companies may be better capitalized than us and we may have difficulty in expanding our holdings through additional mining claims.
 
In competing for qualified mineral exploration personnel, we may be required to pay compensation or benefits relatively higher than those paid in the past, and the availability of qualified personnel may be limited in high-demand mining periods, such as have been experienced during the increased price of gold in recent years.
 
Employees
 
In October 2009, William Schara began employment as our President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). We rely on consulting contracts for some of our management and administrative personnel needs, including for our Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Mr. Ted Sharp. The contract for Mr. Sharp expired on December 31, 2009, however, Mr. Sharp continues to provide services to the Company under the same terms provided in the contract. We employ individuals and contractors on a seasonal basis to conduct exploration, mining and other required company activities, mostly during the late spring through early fall months.
 
We currently have 2 full-time employees; our CEO and Controller. We had as many as 23 part-time employees and contractors during 2011, 5 part-time employees and contractors during 2012, and one employee at the mine site for logistics and other company activities during 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017. In addition to the employees of Goldrich, GNP had as many as 10 employees during 2012, 46 employees during 2013, 10 employees during 2014, 67 employees during 2015, 50 employees during 2016, 63 employees during 2017, and 61 employees in 2018.
 
Seasons
 
We conduct exploration activities at Chandalar between late spring and early autumn. Access during that time is exclusively by airplane. All fuel is supplied to the campsite by air transport. Access during winter months is by ice road, snowmobile and ski-plane. All heavy supplies and equipment are brought in by trucking over the ice road from Coldfoot. Snow melt generally occurs toward the end of May, followed by an intensive, though short, 90-day growing season with 24 hours of daylight and daytime temperatures that range from 60° to 80° Fahrenheit. Freezing temperatures return in late August and freeze-up typically occurs by early October. Winter temperatures, particularly in the lower elevations, can drop to -50° F or colder for extended periods. Annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches, coming mostly in late summer as rain and during the first half of the winter as snow. Winter snow accumulations are modest. The area is essentially an arctic desert.
Regulation
 
Our mineral exploration activities are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing prospecting, exploration, production, labor standards, occupational health and mine safety, control of toxic substances, land use, water use, land claims of local people and other matters involving environmental protection and taxation. New rules and regulations may be enacted, or existing rules and regulations may be applied in a manner that could limit or curtail exploration at our property. It is possible that future changes in these rules or regulations could have a significant impact on our business, causing those activities to be economically re-evaluated at that time.

  Taxes Pertaining to Mining
 
Alaskas tax and regulatory policy is widely viewed by the mining industry as offering the most favorable environment for establishing new mines in the United States. The mining taxation regimes in Alaska have been stable for many years. There is regular discussion of taxation issues in the legislatures but no changes have been proposed that would significantly alter their current state mining taxation structures. The economics of any potential mining operation on our properties would be particularly sensitive to changes in the State of Alaskas tax regimes. Amendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing our operations and the general activities of mining and exploration companies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could cause unanticipated increases in our exploration expenses, capital expenditures or future production costs, or could result in abandonment or delays in establishing operations at our Chandalar property. Although management has no reason to believe that new mining taxation laws that could adversely impact our Chandalar property will materialize, such an event could and may happen in the future.
 
At present, Alaska has a 7% net profits mining license tax on all mineral production (AS 43.65), a 3% net profits royalty on minerals from state lands (AS 38.05.212) (where we hold unpatented state mining claims), and a graduated annual mining claim rental beginning at $1.03/acre. Alaska state corporate income tax is 9.4% if net profit is more than a set threshold amount. Alaska has an exploration incentive credit program (AS 27.30.010) whereby up to $20 million in approved accrued exploration credits can be deducted from the state mining license tax, the state corporate income tax, and the state mining royalty. All qualified new mining operations are exempt from the mining license tax for 3 1/2 years after production begins.
 
Environmental Regulations
 
Our Chandalar property contains an inactive small mining mill site on Tobin Creek with tailings impoundments, last used in 1983. The mill was capable of processing 100 tons of ore per day. A total of 11,884 tons were put through the mill, and into two small adjacent tailings impoundments. A December 19, 1990 letter from the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (the Alaska DEC) to the Alaska Division of Mining of the Department of Natural Resources (the Alaska DNR) states: Our samples indicate the tailings impoundments meet Alaska DEC standards requirements and are acceptable for abandonment and reclamation. The Alaska DNR conveyed acknowledgement of receipt of this report to us in a letter dated December 24, 1990. We subsequently reclaimed the tailings impoundments and expect that no further remedial action will be required. Vegetation has established itself on the tailings impoundments, thereby mitigating erosional forces.
 
In 1990, the Alaska DEC notified us that soil samples taken from a gravel pad adjacent to our Tobin Creek mill site contained elevated levels of mercury. In response to the notification, we engaged a professional mineral engineer to evaluate procedures for remediating contamination at the site. In 1994, the engineer evaluated the contamination and determined that it consists of approximately 160 cubic yards of earthen material that could be cleansed by processing it through a simple gravity washing plant. This plan was subsequently approved by the state. In 2000, the site was listed in the Alaska DECs contaminated sites database as a medium priority contaminated site. We are not aware of any changes in state environmental laws that would affect our state approved cleanup plan or impose a timetable for it to be done. During 2008, our employees took a suite of samples at the contamination site to update the readings taken in 1990 or prior. The results of this sampling reconfirmed the earlier findings, and also suggest that some attenuation of the mercury contamination has occurred. An independent technical consultant assessed those results and believes that proper procedures for sampling and testing were followed. During 2011, 2013 and 2014, we took additional samples that showed an overall reduction of mercury in the previously sampled area. However, one sample on the margin of the sampled area yielded high mercury content, and that may necessitate continued expansion of the area to be sampled in the future. The 2011, 2013 and 2014 sample results were submitted to the State for analysis and determination of what additional sampling the State may require on the area around the mill. In 2013, we received a letter request from the Alaska DEC to update our plan for remediating the contaminated site and in 2014, 2015, and 2016 continued communication with the Alaska DEC to determine what remediation is necessary. We have engaged an independent environmental engineering company to perform an evaluation of the remediation requirements based on locality, latitude, altitude, permafrost and other factors. During 2017, the environmental engineering company performed an eco-scoping study on the site. The Alaska DEC has notified us that further sampling will need to be performed in and around the streambed from the mine site to the streams confluence into Chandalar Lake. At December 31, 2021, we have an accrued liability of $100,000 in our financial statements for sampling and remediation costs.
