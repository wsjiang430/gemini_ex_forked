 ITEM 1 — Business 
 INTRODUCTION 
 Lindsay Corporation, along with its subsidiaries (collectively called “Lindsay” or the “Company”), is a global leader in providing a variety of proprietary water management and road infrastructure products and services.  The Company has been involved in the manufacture and distribution of agricultural irrigation equipment since 1955 and has grown from a regional company to an international water efficiency solutions and highway infrastructure firm with worldwide sales and distribution.  Lindsay, a Delaware corporation, maintains its corporate offices in Omaha, Nebraska.  The Company has operations which are categorized into two major reporting segments, Irrigation and Infrastructure.
 Irrigation Segment – The Company’s irrigation segment includes the manufacture and marketing of center pivot, lateral move, and hose reel irrigation systems which are used principally in the agricultural industry to increase or stabilize crop production while conserving water, energy and labor.  The irrigation segment also manufactures and markets repair and replacement parts for its irrigation systems and controls.  The Company continues to strengthen irrigation product offerings through innovative technology such as Global Positioning System (“GPS”) positioning and guidance, variable rate irrigation, wireless irrigation management, irrigation scheduling, machine-to-machine (“M2M”) communication technology solutions and smartphone applications.  The Company’s primary domestic irrigation manufacturing facilities are located in Lindsay, Nebraska and Olathe, Kansas.  Internationally, the Company has production operations in Brazil, France, China, Turkey, and South Africa, as well as distribution and sales operations in the Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand.  The Company also exports equipment from the U.S. to other international markets.
 Infrastructure Segment – The Company’s infrastructure segment includes the manufacture and marketing of moveable barriers, specialty barriers, crash cushions and end terminals, road marking and road safety equipment, large diameter steel tubing, and railroad signals and structures.  The infrastructure segment also provides outsourced manufacturing and production services.  The principal infrastructure manufacturing facilities are located in Rio Vista, California; Milan, Italy; and Lindsay, Nebraska. 
PRODUCTS BY SEGMENT 
 IRRIGATION SEGMENT 
 Products - The Company manufactures and markets its center pivot, lateral move irrigation systems, and irrigation controls in the U.S. and internationally under its Zimmatic® brand.  The Company also manufactures and markets hose reel travelers under the Perrot™ and Greenfield® brands.  The Company also produces or markets chemical injection systems, variable rate irrigation systems, flow meters, weather stations, soil moisture sensors, and remote monitoring and control systems which it sells under its GrowSmart® brand.  In addition to whole systems, the Company manufactures and markets repair and replacement parts for its irrigation systems and controls.  Furthermore, the Company designs and manufactures innovative M2M communication technology solutions, data acquisition and management systems, and custom electronic equipment for critical applications under its Elecsys™ brand. 
 The Company’s irrigation systems are primarily of the standard center pivot type, with a small portion of its products consisting of the lateral move type.  Both are automatic move systems consisting of sprinklers mounted on a water carrying pipeline which is supported approximately 11 feet off the ground by a truss system suspended between moving towers. 
 A standard center pivot in the U.S. is typically seven spans and approximately 1,300 feet long and is designed to circle within a quarter‑section of land, which comprises 160 acres, wherein it irrigates approximately 125 to 130 acres.  A center pivot or lateral move system can also be custom designed and can irrigate from 25 to 600+ acres.
 A center pivot system represents a significant investment to a farmer.  In a dry land conversion to center pivot irrigation, approximately one‑half of the investment is for the pivot itself, and the remainder is attributable to installation of additional equipment such as wells, pumps, underground water pipes, electrical supply, and a concrete pad upon which the pivot is anchored.  The Company’s center pivot and lateral move irrigation systems can be enhanced with a family of integrated proprietary products such as GPS monitoring and other automated controls.

The Company also manufactures and distributes hose reel travelers.  Hose reel travelers are typically deployed in smaller or irregular fields and usually are easy to operate, easy to move from field to field, and a smaller investment than a typical standard center pivot.   
 The Company also markets proprietary remote monitoring and automation technology that works on any brand of electronic pivot and drip irrigation systems and is sold on a subscription basis under the FieldNET® product name.  FieldNET® technology enables growers to remotely monitor and operate irrigation equipment, saving time, and reducing water and energy consumption.  The technology uses cellular or radio frequency communication systems to remotely acquire data relating to various conditions in an irrigated field, including operational status of the irrigation system, position of the irrigation system, water usage, weather and soil conditions, and similar data.  The system can remotely control the irrigation system, altering the speed to vary water application amounts, and controlling pump station and diesel generator operation.  Data management and control is achieved using applications running on various personal computer or mobile devices connected to the internet.  
 The Company also markets patented technology under the FieldNET Advisor™ product name which delivers information that helps farmers decide precisely when, where and how much to irrigate.  This technology combines more than 40 years of crop and irrigation science with FieldNET’s cloud computing capabilities, remote sensing functionality and machine learning to provide farmers with field-specific and crop-specific irrigation recommendations.
 Other Types of Irrigation – Center pivot and lateral move irrigation systems compete with three other types of irrigation: flood, drip, and other mechanical devices such as hose reel travelers and solid set sprinklers.  The bulk of worldwide irrigation is accomplished by traditional flood irrigation.  Flood irrigation is accomplished by either flooding an entire field, or by providing a water source (ditches or a pipe) along the side of a field, which is planed and slopes slightly away from the water source.  The water is released to the crop rows through gates in the ditch or pipe, or through siphon tubes arching over the ditch wall into some of the crop rows.  It runs down through the crop row until it reaches the far end of the row, at which time the water source is moved and another set of rows are flooded.  Disadvantages or limitations of flood irrigation include that it cannot be used to irrigate uneven, hilly, or rolling terrain, it can be wasteful or inefficient and coverage can become inconsistently applied.  In “drip” or “low flow” irrigation, perforated plastic pipe or tape is installed on the ground or buried underground at the root level.  Several other types of mechanical devices, such as hose reel travelers, irrigate the remaining irrigated acres. 
 Center pivot, lateral move, and hose reel traveler irrigation offer significant advantages when compared with other types of irrigation.  It requires less labor and monitoring; can be used on sandy ground, which, due to poor water retention ability, must have water applied frequently; can be used on uneven ground, thereby allowing previously unsuitable land to be brought into production; can be used for the application of fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides, or other chemicals (termed “fertigation” or “chemigation”); and conserves water and chemicals through precise control of the amount and timing of the application. 
 Markets ‑ Water is an essential and critical requirement for crop production, and the extent, regularity, and frequency of water application can be a critical factor in crop quality and yield.  The fundamental factors which govern the demand for center pivot and lateral move systems are essentially the same in both the U.S. and international markets.  Demand for center pivot and lateral move systems is determined by whether the value of the increased crop production and cost savings attributable to center pivot or lateral move irrigation exceeds any increased costs associated with purchasing, installing, and operating the equipment.  Thus, the decision to purchase a center pivot or lateral move system, in part, reflects the profitability of agricultural production, which is determined primarily by the prices of agricultural commodities and the costs of other farming inputs.
 The current demand for center pivot systems has three sources: conversion to center pivot systems from less water-efficient, more labor-intensive types of irrigation; replacement of older center pivot systems, which are beyond their useful lives or are technologically obsolete; and conversion of dry land farming to irrigated farming.  Demand for center pivots and lateral move irrigation equipment also depends upon the need for the particular operational characteristics and advantages of such systems in relation to alternative types of irrigation, primarily flood.  More efficient use of the basic natural resources of land, water, and energy helps drive demand for center pivot and lateral move irrigation equipment.  An increasing global population not only increases demand for agricultural output, but also places additional and competing demands on land, water, and energy.  The Company expects demand for center pivots and lateral move systems to continue to increase relative to other irrigation methods because center pivot and lateral move systems are preferred where the soil is sandy; the terrain is not flat; the land area to be irrigated is sizeable; there is a shortage of reliable labor; water supply is restricted and conservation is preferred or critical; and/or fertigation or chemigation will be utilized.

United States Market – In the United States, the Company sells its branded irrigation systems, including Zimmatic®, to over 200 independent dealers, who resell to their customer, the farmer.  Dealers assess their customers’ requirements, design the most efficient solution, assemble and erect the system in the field, and provide additional system components, primarily relating to water supply (wells, pumps, pipes) and electrical supply (on-site generation or hook-up to power lines).  Lindsay dealers generally are established local agribusinesses, many of which also deal in related products, such as well drilling and water pump equipment, farm implements, grain handling and storage systems, and farm structures.   
 International Market – The Company sells center pivot and lateral move irrigation systems throughout the world.  International sales accounted for approximately 38 percent and 33 percent of the Company’s total irrigation segment revenues in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The Company sells direct to consumers, as well as through an international dealer network, and has production and sales operations in Brazil, France, China, Turkey, and South Africa, as well as distribution and sales operations in the Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand serving the key South American, European, Chinese, African, Russian, Ukrainian, Middle East, Australian, and New Zealand markets.  The Company also exports irrigation equipment from the U.S. to international markets.  
 The Company’s international markets differ with respect to the need for irrigation, the ability to pay, demand, customer type, government support of agriculture, marketing and sales methods, equipment requirements, and the difficulty of on-site erection.  The Company’s industry position is such that it believes that it will likely be considered as a potential supplier for most major international agricultural development projects utilizing center pivot or lateral move irrigation systems.   
 Competition – Four manufacturers control a substantial majority of the U.S. center pivot irrigation system industry.  The international irrigation market includes participation and competition by the leading U.S. manufacturers, as well as various regional manufacturers.  The Company competes in certain product lines with several manufacturers, some of whom may have greater financial resources than the Company.  The Company competes by continuously improving its products through ongoing research and development activities.  The Company continues to strengthen irrigation product offerings through innovative technology such as GPS positioning and guidance, variable rate irrigation, wireless irrigation management, and smartphone applications, as well as through the acquisition of products and services that allow the Company to provide a more comprehensive solution to growers’ needs.   Competition also occurs in areas of price and seasonal programs, product quality, durability, controls, product characteristics, retention and reputation of local dealers, customer service, and, at certain times of the year, the availability of systems and their delivery time.  On balance, the Company believes it competes favorably with respect to these factors. 
INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENT 
 Products – The Company’s Quickchange® Moveable Barrier™ system, commonly known as the Road Zipper System®, is composed of three parts:  1) T-shaped concrete and steel barriers that are connected to form a continuous wall; 2) a Barrier Transfer Machine™ (“BTM™”) capable of moving the barrier laterally across the pavement; and 3) the variable length barriers necessary for accommodating curves.  A barrier element is approximately 32 inches high, 12-24 inches wide, 3 feet long, and weighs 1,500 pounds.  The barrier elements are interconnected by heavy duty steel hinges to form a continuous barrier.  The BTM™ employs an inverted S-shaped conveyor mechanism that lifts the barrier, moving it laterally before setting it back on the roadway surface. 
 In permanent applications, the Road Zipper System® increases capacity and reduces congestion by varying the number of directional traffic lanes to match the traffic demand and promotes safety by maintaining the physical separation of opposing lanes of traffic.  Roadways with fixed medians have a set number of lanes in each direction and cannot be adjusted to traffic demands that may change over the course of a day, or to capacity reductions caused by traffic incidents or road repair and maintenance.  Applications include high-volume highways where expansion may not be feasible due to lack of additional right-of-way, environmental concerns, or insufficient funding.  The Road Zipper System® is particularly useful in busy commuter corridors and at choke points such as bridges and tunnels.  Road Zipper Systems® can also be deployed at roadway or roadside construction sites to accelerate construction, improve traffic flow, and safeguard work crews and motorists by positively separating the work area and traffic.  Examples of types of work completed with the help of a Road Zipper System® include highway reconstruction, paving and resurfacing, road widening, median and shoulder construction, and repairs to tunnels and bridges.   
 The Company offers a variety of equipment lease options for Road Zipper Systems® and BTM™ equipment used in construction applications.  The leases extend for periods of one month or more for equipment already existing in the Company’s lease fleet.  Longer lease periods may be required for specialty equipment that must be built for specific projects.  Sales for a highway safety or road improvement project range from $2.0 to $20.0 million, making them significant capital investments.

Crash Cushions and End Terminals – The Company offers a complete line of redirective and non-redirective crash cushions which are used to enhance highway safety at locations such as toll booths, freeway off-ramps, medians and roadside barrier ends, bridge supports, utility poles, and other fixed roadway hazards.  The Company’s primary crash cushion products cover a full range of lengths, widths, speed capacities, and application accessories and include the following brand names:  TAU®; Universal TAU-II®; TAU-II-R™; TAU-B_NR™; ABSORB 350®; Walt™; TAU-M™; ABSORB-M™ and TAU-TUBE™. In addition to these products the Company also offers guardrail end terminal products such as the X-Tension®; X-Lite®; MAX-Tension® and ATT Terminal™ systems.  The crash cushions and end terminal products compete with other vendors in the world market.  These systems are generally sold through a distribution channel that is domiciled in particular geographic areas. 
 Specialty Barriers – The Company also offers specialty barrier products such as the SAB™, ArmorGuard™, PaveGuard™, and DR46™ portable barrier and/or barrier gate systems.  These products offer portability and flexibility in setting up and modifying barriers in work areas and provide quick-opening, high-containment gates for use in median or roadside barriers.  The gates are generally used to create openings in barrier walls of various types for both construction and incident management purposes.  The DR46™ is an energy-absorbing barrier that can help protect motorcyclists from impacting guardrail posts which is an area of focus by departments of transportation and government regulators for reducing the amount and severity of injuries. 
 Road Marking and Road Safety Equipment – The Company also offers preformed tape and a line of road safety accessory products.  The preformed tape is used primarily in temporary applications such as markings for work zones, street crossings, and road center lines or boundaries.  The road safety equipment consists of mostly plastic and rubber products used for delineation, slowing traffic, and signaling.  The Company also manages an ISO 17025 certified testing laboratory that performs full-scale impact testing of highway safety products in accordance with the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (“NCHRP”) Report 350, the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (“MASH”), and the European Norms (“EN1317 Norms”) for these types of products.  The NCHRP Report 350 and MASH guidelines are procedures required by the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration (“FHWA”) for the safety performance evaluation of highway features.  The EN1317 Norms are being used to qualify roadway safety products for the European markets. 
 Other Products – The Company’s Diversified Manufacturing, Rail and Tubing business manufactures and markets railroad signals and structures, and large diameter steel tubing, and provides outsourced manufacturing and production services for other companies.  The Company’s customer base includes large industrial companies and railroads.  Customers benefit from the Company’s design and engineering capabilities as well as the Company’s ability to provide a wide spectrum of manufacturing services, including welding, machining, painting, forming, galvanizing, and assembling hydraulic, electrical, and mechanical components. 
 Markets – The Company’s primary infrastructure market includes moveable concrete barriers, delineation systems, crash cushions, and similar protective equipment.  The U.S. roadway infrastructure market includes projects such as new roadway construction, bridges, tunnels, maintenance and resurfacing, and development of technologies for relief of roadway congestion.  Much of the U.S. highway infrastructure market is driven by government (federal and state) spending programs.  For example, the U.S. government funds highway and road improvements through the Federal Highway Trust Fund Program.  This program provides funding to improve the nation’s roadway system.  Matching funding from the various states may be required as a condition of federal funding.  In the long term, the Company believes that the federal program provides a solid platform for growth in the U.S. market, as it is generally acknowledged that additional funding will be required for infrastructure development and maintenance in the future. 
 The global market for the Company’s infrastructure products continues to be driven by population growth and the need for improved road safety. The international market is very different from country to country.  The standardization in performance requirements and acceptance criteria for highway safety devices adopted by the European Committee for Standardization is expected to lead to greater uniformity and a larger installation program.  Prevention programs put in place in various countries to lower highway traffic fatalities may also lead to greater demand. The Company distributes infrastructure products in Europe, South America, the Middle East, Australia and Asia.  The Company expects to continue expanding in international markets as populations grow and markets become more established.
 Competition – The Company competes in certain product lines with several manufacturers, some of whom may have greater financial resources than the Company.  The Company competes by continuously improving its products through ongoing research and development activities. The Company competes with certain products and companies in its crash cushion business, but has limited competition in its moveable barrier line, as there is not another 
 6


moveable barrier product today comparable to the Road Zipper System®.  However, the Company’s barrier product does compete with traditional “safety-shaped” concrete barriers and other safety barriers.
 Distribution Methods and Channels – The Company has dedicated production and sales operations in the United States and Italy.  Sales efforts consist of both direct sales and sales programs managed by its network of distributors and third-party representatives.  The sales teams have responsibility for new business development and assisting distributors and dealers in soliciting large projects and new customers.  The distributor and dealer networks have exclusive territories and are responsible for developing sales and providing service, including product maintenance, repair, and installation.  The typical dealer sells an array of safety supplies, road signs, crash cushions, delineation equipment, and other highway products.  Customers include departments of transportation, municipal transportation road agencies, roadway contractors, subcontractors, distributors, and dealers.  Due to the project nature of the roadway construction and congestion management markets, the Company’s customer base changes from year to year.  Due to the limited life of projects, it is rare that a single customer will account for a significant amount of revenues in consecutive years.  The customer base also varies depending on the type of product sold.  The Company’s moveable barrier products are typically sold to transportation agencies or the contractors or suppliers serving those agencies.  In contrast, distributors account for a majority of crash cushion sales since those products have lower price points and tend to have shorter lead times.
GENERAL 
 Certain information generally applicable to both of the Company’s reportable segments is set forth below. 
 SEASONALITY 
 Irrigation equipment sales are seasonal by nature.  Farmers generally order systems to be delivered and installed before the growing season.  Shipments to customers located in Northern Hemisphere countries usually peak during the Company’s second and third fiscal quarters for the spring planting period.  Sales of infrastructure products are traditionally higher during prime road construction seasons and lower in the winter.  The primary construction season for Northern Hemisphere countries generally corresponds with the Company’s third and fourth fiscal quarters. 
CUSTOMERS 
 The Company is not dependent upon a single customer or upon a limited number of customers for a material part of either segment’s business.  The loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow. 
ORDER BACKLOG
 As of August 31, 2019, the Company had an order backlog of $55.4 million compared with $53.3 million at August 31, 2018.  Included in these backlogs are amounts of $10.0 million and $3.3 million, respectively, that are not expected to be fulfilled within the subsequent fiscal year.  The Company’s backlog can fluctuate from period to period due to the seasonality, cyclicality, timing, and execution of contracts.  Backlog typically represents long-term projects as well as short lead-time orders; therefore, it is generally not a good indication of the revenues to be realized in succeeding quarters.
 RAW MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS
Raw materials used by the Company include coil steel, angle steel, plate steel, zinc, tires, gearboxes, concrete, rebar, fasteners, and electrical and hydraulic components (motors, switches, cable, valves, hose, and stators).  The Company has, on occasion, faced shortages of certain such materials.  The Company believes it currently has ready access from assorted domestic and foreign suppliers to adequate supplies of raw materials and components. 
 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $23.2 million, $11.1 million, and $8.9 million, respectively.  Higher capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 resulted primarily from the relocation of the corporate headquarters and an increase in the Road Zipper System® lease assets.  Capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 are estimated to be approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million, including equipment replacement, productivity improvements and new product development. The Company’s management does maintain flexibility to modify the amount and timing of some of the planned expenditures in response to economic conditions.

In addition, the Company owns multiple patents dealing with cellular communication techniques, cathodic protection measurement methods, and data compression and transmission.  Lindsay follows a policy of applying for patents on all significant patentable inventions in markets deemed appropriate.  Although the Company believes it is important to follow a patent protection policy, Lindsay’s business is not dependent, to any material extent, on any single patent or group of patents. 
EMPLOYEES 
 The number of persons employed by the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries at the fiscal years ended 2019, 2018, and 2017 was 1,069, 1,412, and 1,410, respectively.  None of the Company’s U.S. employees are represented by a union.  Certain of the Company’s non-U.S. employees are unionized due to local governmental regulations. 
 ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS
The Company is subject to numerous laws and regulations that govern environmental and occupational health and safety matters.  The Company believes that its operations are substantially in compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations, and that it holds all necessary permits in each jurisdiction in which its facilities are located.  Environmental and health and safety regulations are subject to change and interpretation.  In some cases, compliance with applicable regulations or standards may require the Company to make additional capital and operational expenditures.  The Company, however, is not currently aware of any material expenditures required to comply with such regulations, other than information related to the environmental remediation activities described in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  The Company accrues for the anticipated cost of investigation and remediation when the obligation is probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Any revisions to these estimates could be material to the operating results of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year, however the Company does not expect such additional expenses would have a material adverse effect on its liquidity or financial condition.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND U.S. OPERATIONS 
 The Company’s primary production facilities are located in the United States.  The Company has smaller production and sales operations in Brazil, France, Italy, China, Turkey, and South Africa, as well as distribution and sales operations in the Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand.  Where the Company exports products from the United States to international markets, the Company generally ships against prepayment, an irrevocable letter of credit confirmed by a U.S. bank or another secured means of payment, or with credit insurance from a third party.  For sales within both U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, prepayments or other forms of security may be required before credit is granted, however most local sales are made based on payment terms after a full credit review has been performed.  Most of the Company’s financial transactions are in U.S. dollars, although some export sales and sales from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are conducted in other currencies. Approximately 26 and 23 percent, respectively, of total consolidated Company sales were conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2019 and 2018.  To reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on these sales and purchase commitments conducted in local currencies, the Company monitors its risk of foreign currency fluctuations and, at times, may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars.
 In addition to the transactional foreign currency exposures mentioned above, the Company also has translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of its international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars.  In order to reduce this translation exposure, the Company, at times, utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its net investment exposure in its foreign operations.  For information on the Company’s foreign currency risks, see Item 7A of Part II of this report.
