Item 1. Business
Overview

Weyland Techs core platform, offered as a Platform as a Service (PaaS) also referred to under the brand name CreateApp, enables small-medium-sized businesses ("SMB") to create a mobile application ("app") without the need of technical knowledge, high investment or background in IT. The Company recognizes revenue on a pay to use subscription basis when our customers use our platform.

We believe that SMBs can increase sales, reach more customers and promote their products and services via a simple easy to build mobile app at an affordable price and in a cost-effective manner.

Weyland Tech, Inc. is focused on mobile commerce enablement via our enhanced platform built in 2017 and, offered on a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) basis, and the companys e-wallet initiative. Recent product launches with our strategic partners DPEX (Indonesia), BGT (Thailand), Augicom/Orange (France) are representative of the PaaS platform strategy and product offering.

As a result, the Companys core product has evolved over the course of 2017 and 2018 to capitalize on the immediate opportunity for developing a larger network of valuable users and merchants by developing services that will enable the adoption of mobile commerce across Greater South East Asia. The platform enhancements have taken the Companys technology from a standalone DIY app builder to an enhanced platform built to enable mobile commerce.

In 2018, Weyland focused on scaling this business model by continuing to develop and expand strategic partnerships that would increase the number of users and merchants available to users of the Companys products on a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) basis. These efforts expanded on the success of recent product launches representative of the PaaS platform strategy and product offerings with our strategic partners DPEX (Indonesia), BGT (Thailand), and Augicom/Orange (France). And after extensive discussions with our partners, management believes that supporting these initiatives through deeper engagement, interaction and co-marketing/sales substantially benefited the Company in 2018 and beyond. 

The Company is also pleased to report that its late 2017 e-wallet initiative, AtozPay, has surpassed expectations since its launch, achieving stronger than anticipated customer traction with limited marketing expense. With the AtozPay e-wallet, the Company created a consumer facing product offering that supports the PaaS strategy developed by the enhancements to the CreateApp platform and enables Weyland to drive higher monetization on those platforms by providing payments capabilities. 

Digital Wallet or eWallet a digital financial services business, a distinguishing characteristic of Greater South East Asia (GSEA) compared to the United States is the substantially lower percentage of the population with bank accounts, credit cards, or debit cards. This creates the need for alternative payment methods, specifically e-wallets. 

GSEA is poised for its own payments transformation in much the same way that China has shifted to online payments, according to IDC. Online payments in GSEA is divided into four broad payment modes: e-wallets, such as our AtoZPay platform, credit cards, debit cards and online banking. Of these, the e-wallet mode is expected to grow the fastest over the next five years, according to IDC. Drivers for GSEAs e-wallet industry include the mismatch between internet penetration and banking penetration, which creates a structural opportunity for e-wallets; the 

1

increasing integration of e-wallets with use cases such as online games and e-commerce; and the opportunity to offer broader digital financial services using e-wallets as a foundation.

AtozPay officially exited the closed beta environment on May 23, 2018 and officially launched for business.

AtozPay is designed to be a robust, universal payment platform therefore its growth is not limited to the Companys PaaS customers alone. 

On April 23, 2018, the Company participated in the incorporation of a company in Indonesia, PT Weyland Indonesia Perkasa (WIP), an Indonesian limited liability company of which the Company held a 49% equity interest with the option to purchase an additional 31% equity interest at a later date. Based on the results of operations of WIP from April 23, 2018 to December 31, 2018, the investment in WIP had been fully impaired and written off.

The Company holds 49% equity interest and a 31% unexercised option in WIP as at December 31, 2018. Due to the continuing legal restructuring in Indonesia, all the conditions precedent had not been satisfied and the 31% option had not been exercised as at December 31, 2018. 

In order to maximize the independent growth of AtoZPay and consequently shareholder value, management began the process to spin-off the e-wallet business via a special dividend, and on September 24, 2018, the Company announced that it has made available, to its transfer agent, DTCC and DTC Participants with positions in WEYL, instructions for receiving the spin-off shares of its Weyland AtoZ Pay subsidiary (WAI). 

Our Strategy

Although Weyland Tech's CreateApp platform originally focused on the Pan-Asia marketsthe platform is provided in fourteen, predominantly Asian, languageswe have partners that work with us to develop other markets. 

The CreateApp platform enables SMB to create a mobile application ("app") without the need of technical knowledge, high investment or background in IT.

We believe that through our app, SMB can increase sales, reach more customers and promote their products and services via a simple easy to build mobile app at an affordable price and in a cost-effective manner.

Weyland Tech currently offers the CreateApp platform directly, as a Platform as a Service (PaaS) in the following key markets:

-Singapore: www.createappsingapore.com

-India (Jaipur): www.aapkiapp.in

Weyland Tech currently offers a DIY App builder through a 'white label' platform, also under a PaaS model, with the apps developed generating revenue in the following markets, primarily via cooperation agreements that were structured in late 2015, 2016 and 2017:

- EU, via a Strategic Cooperation with Augicom S.A. (www.augicom.ch)
 - Malaysia, via a Cooperation Agreement with Silver Ridge Tangerine Sdn Bhd (www.silverridge.com.my)

2

- Hong Kong and South China via a Cooperation Agreement with Info Zone Development Ltd. 
 - Indonesia, via a Cooperation Agreement with DPEX Worldwide 
 - Thailand via a Cooperation Agreement with BGT Corporation Public Company Limited 
 - The Philippines via a Cooperation Agreement with MocaApp 
 - France via a Cooperation Agreement with Orange Pro 

For the territories licensed to our distributors and on a white label basis, we derive royalty income from the end user use of our platform.

SMBs

The Company believes that these agreements will create a large enough addressable market opportunity to generate sales and profits in a scalable manner, grow the Company's business and enhance shareholder value. Given the nature of DIY mobile apps ("apps"), and the primary target market of SMB, a typical go-to-market strategy would have a direct sales force or resellers approach SMB directly to drive our revenue.

Over the past two years, the Company has evolved our Platform as a service model with three distinct market paths to drive recurring revenue business model:

A) Cooperation agreements in countries/regions where our partners are responsible for targeting SMB either through an installed base of customers or groups of Direct Sellers with a sales force encompassing SMB as end customers.

B) Enterprise Solutions where large retailers (hypermarket chains, mall owners, brand owners with company-owned and franchise stores) adopt a 'Master App' on a white-label basis, hosted at a 3rd party regional Hosting or Data Center facility.

C) Digital Wallet or e-Wallet: a digital financial services business, a distinguishing characteristic of Greater South East Asia (GSEA) compared to the United States, is the substantially lower percentage of the population in GSEA with bank accounts, credit cards, or debit cards. This creates the need for alternative payment methods, specifically e-wallets. GSEA is poised for its own payments transformation in much the same way that China has shifted to online payments, according to IDC. Online payments in GSEA is divided into four broad payment modes: e-wallets, such as our AtoZPay platform, credit cards, debit cards and online banking. Of these, the e-wallet mode is expected to grow the fastest over the next five years, according to IDC. Drivers for GSEAs e-wallet industry include the mismatch between internet penetration and banking penetration, which creates a structural opportunity for e-wallets; the increasing integration of e-wallets with use cases such as online games and e-commerce; and the opportunity to offer broader digital financial services using e-wallets as a foundation.

With the above strategy, we believe that the Company has been able to maintain a lower capital expenditure base due to the 'level-two' customer support vs. 'level-one' customer support, smaller sales and marketing teams, and the need to provide hosting services.

The Companys CreateApp Platform operates as a Platform as a Service (PaaS) allowing users to develop their own applications supplying the infrastructure and IT services, which users can access anywhere via a web or desktop browser. The Company recognizes revenue on a pay to use subscription basis when our customers use our platform. 

3

We do not compensate resellers and distributors, instead the end user pays the reseller/distributor directly as well as paying for our services, for which we or our reseller/distributor in licensed territories bill the end user separately.

Growth of the Mobile Apps Industry

We believe that there are a number of factors that are contributing to the continued growth of the mobile apps industry: (i) smartphone adoption continues to increase globally; (ii) lower purchase prices of smartphones for consumers; (iii) smartphone users are becoming increasingly comfortable with the process of searching for and conducting business on their phones; (iv) SMB are placing more emphasis on implementing a mobile app versus a mobile website to enable customers to gain a higher level of interaction and functionality; and (v) internet users in emerging markets use smartphones as their primary internet access device, having bypassed the desktop PC entirely. We believe that the Company will be able to participate in the growth of the mobile apps industry by offering an affordable, easy to build and use platform.

On December 14, 2018 the Company announced that after reviewing the beneficial owner lists submitted by banks/brokers in connection with its Weyland AtoZ Pay Inc. (WAI) spin-off, the Company has decided to distribute the WAI spin-off shares via book-entry statement from its transfer agent, in lieu of stock certificate form as was originally intended. From a shareholder perspective, book-entry account statements from the transfer agent are the functional equivalent of stock certificates. The Company believes that switching to a book-entry statement delivery method will expedite the delivery of the WAI spin-off shares to beneficial owners and bank/brokers, and also streamline the process for banks/brokers in connection with their handling of objecting beneficial owner (OBO) and retirement account spin-off shares, which they will receive directly. 

On October 10, 2018 the Company announced a $2 million investment from TRITON FUNDS LP, the La Jolla, CA-based investment fund, allegedly, managed by students from the University of California, San Diego and California State University, Northridge.

On November 7, 2018, the Company entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with RedDiamond Partners LLC (the Equity Agreement), with respect to an equity line of credit for up to Five Million Dollars. The Equity Agreement allows the Company to sell shares to RedDiamond by providing them with notice (a Purchase Notice) of the Companys request to sell such shares which shall not exceed 20% of the aggregate trading volume of the Common Stock during the 5 trading days preceding the date of the Purchase Notice (the Maximum Weekly Amount) and further subject to other limitations. The purchase price at an assumed purchase price under the Equity Agreement of the the lower of (i) 85% of the of the lowest of the VWAP for each of the five (5) trading days preceding and including the Clearing Date with respect to the subject Purchase Notice, or (ii) 90% of the average of the two (2) lowest VWAPS for the five (5) days after the Clearing Date.

RedDiamond has agreed to a no-shorting clause in the Equity Agreement, which generally prohibits RedDiamond from engaging in any short sales of our Common Stock during the term of the Equity Agreement. Nevertheless, we do anticipate that RedDiamond will sell the shares it acquires with respect to each Purchase Notice during the period of time occurring shortly after the delivery of such shares. If the Company terminates the Purchase Agreement, other than in the event of a material breach by RedDiamond, prior to the purchase of at least $3,000,000 of the Commitment Amount, then the Company must pay to RedDiamond as liquidated damages and compensation for the costs of being prepared to make funds available and make purchases hereunder, an amount equal to twelve and one-half percent (12.5%) of the remaining amount of the Commitment Amount not purchased.

The Equity Agreement was entered into in conjunction with a Registration Rights Agreement with a mandatory registration statement filing requirement. The Company has filed an initial Registration Statement on Form S-1.

Competition

Our business is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Our current and potential competitors include Online Gaming companies, eCommerce and eWallet platforms.

Each of the above listed industries in GSEA is highly fragmented. We face competition in each of our lines of business in each market where we operate. Some of our competitors, particularly those based outside of GSEA, may have greater access to capital markets, more financial and other resources, and a longer operating history than we do.
Online Games

We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including user base, game portfolio, quality of user experience, brand awareness and reputation, relationships with game developers and access to distribution and payment channels. Our competitors primarily include companies with a presence in just one or a few markets in the region.
E-commerce

We face competition principally from regional players that operate across several markets in the region. We also face competition from single-market players in the region. We compete to attract, engage and retain buyers based on the variety and value of products and services listed on our marketplaces, overall user experience and convenience, online communication tools, integration with mobile and networking applications and tools, quality of mobile applications, and availability of payment settlement and logistics services. We also compete to attract and retain sellers based on the number and engagement of buyers, the effectiveness and value of the marketing services we offer, commission rates and the usefulness of the services we provide including data and analytics for potential buyer targeting, cloud computing services and the availability of support services including payment settlement and logistics services.
E-wallet Platforms

AtoZPay competes primarily with credit card and debit card service providers, banks with payment processing offerings, other offline payment options and other electronic payment system operators. AtoZPay competes with these companies primarily on the basis of transaction processing speed, convenience, network size, accessibility, reliability and price. We believe the combination of AtoZPays numerous physical service counters and the AtoZPay App is a significant competitive advantage because of the strong demand in GSEA for convenient forms of payment processing.

Our business is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) Advertising companies, Web design firms and more recently, mobile app makers; (2) other DIY mobile app companies; (3) a number of indirect competitors, including media companies, web portals, comparison shopping websites, and web search engines, either directly or in collaboration with SMB; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website/app development.; (5) companies that provide infrastructure web and mobile services. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our mobile apps business include ease of use, affordability and broad range of functionality. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, slightly longer histories, more customers, and greater brand recognition. They may adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology, functionality and ease of use and marketing. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.
