INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Our expertise is Sketch-to-Scale® services: design, manufacture, and supply chain services for a broad range of products, from medical devices, connected automotive systems and smart home appliances to sustainable lighting and cloud data center infrastructures. Although Flex has evolved beyond traditional EMS, the majority of our customers are electronics original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"); as such, the closest broad definition of our industry remains the outsourced EMS industry. 
EMS has experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elect to outsource some or all of their design, manufacturing, and after-market services requirements. In recent years we have seen an increased level of diversification by many companies, in the technology, automotive and healthcare industries along with the convergence of many industries being transformed by technology advancements. Companies that have historically identified themselves as software providers, internet service providers, or e-commerce retailers are entering the highly competitive and rapidly evolving hardware markets, with products that include mobile devices, home entertainment products, and wearable devices. This trend has resulted in significant changes to the hardware manufacturing and supply chain solutions requirements of such companies. Increasingly complex products require highly customized supply chain solutions, in turn resulting in significant changes to the overall manufacturing and supply chain landscape. The growth of the overall industry for calendar year 2018 is estimated to have been around 4%.
We believe the total available market for the EMS industry is poised for continued growth, with current penetration rates estimated to be about 31%. The intensely competitive nature of the electronics industry, the increasing complexity and sophistication of electronics products, and pressure on OEMs to reduce product costs and shorten product life cycles are all factors that encourage OEMs to utilize supply chain service providers as part of their business and manufacturing strategies. Utilizing global manufacturing and service providers allows OEMs to take advantage of the global design, manufacturing and supply chain management expertise of such providers, and enables OEMs to concentrate on product research, development, marketing, and sales. We believe that OEMs realize a number of important benefits through their strategic relationships with EMS providers, including:

• | Improved inventory management and purchasing power;


• | Access to worldwide design, engineering, manufacturing, and after-market service capabilities;


• | Ability to focus on core branding and R&D initiatives;


• | Accelerated time-to-market and time-to-volume production;


• | Improved efficiency and optimized production costs;


• | Improved product quality through advanced design and production at scale; and

4


• | Reduced capital investment requirements and fixed costs;

We believe that growth in the EMS industry will be largely driven by the need for OEMs to respond to rapidly changing industries, markets and technologies, the increasing complexity of supply chains and the continued pressure to be innovative and cost competitive. Additionally, we believe that there are significant opportunities for global EMS providers to win additional business from OEMs in markets or industry segments that have yet to substantially utilize such providers.

We believe we are extremely competitive with regard to all of these factors.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPSONSIBLITY
Sustainability remains central to who we are and how we operate. Our sustainability governance principles are a core part of our business operations. Through innovation and smart technologies, our sustainable solutions positively impact people and the environment.
Since February 2018, we have been participants of the United Nations Global Compact ("UNGC"), the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative, to showcase our commitment to integrate sustainability throughout our company and across our entire supply chain. Our commitment aims to help customers, partners and other businesses increase their own efforts to build a more sustainable future. 
Our strategy and global efforts, through our sustainability programs and multi-year "Flex 20 by 2020 goals," are aligned with the principles set forth in the UNGC, and the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals ("SDGs"). While our global efforts 
10

contribute to most of the SDGs, we have prioritized them and focus on decent work, quality education, clean energy and responsible consumption and production. 
We achieve social and environmental compliance through a robust integrated management system that consolidates several management systems into one. Our Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility management system has several elements, including environmental, health and safety compliance, labor and human rights and ethics. The Flex Social and Environmental framework is based upon the principles, policies, and standards prescribed by the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”), a worldwide association of electronics companies committed to promoting an industry code of conduct for global electronics supply chains to improve working and environmental, health and safety conditions, as well as other relevant international standards (e.g., ISO 14001, United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights). Flex is a founding member of the RBA. Social responsibility is also an area of increasing concern, with specific regulations such as the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation on Human Trafficking and the U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015, all creating new compliance and disclosure obligations for the Company and for our customers. We operate a number of programs, including compliance audits, data collection, training and leadership programs that focus upon driving continuous improvement in social, ethical, and environmental performance throughout all of our global operating units, all in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics ("CoBCE"). We also go beyond compliance by offering a wide range of programs and initiatives to engage both our internal and external stakeholders.
We are committed to providing decent work for Flex employees, respecting their dignity and striving to advance human rights around the world. Our philosophy, strategies, and policies in human rights, health and safety, diversity and inclusion, support the inclusion of all people in our working environment. Some of the cornerstone specific goals through which we measure our performance include increasing employee development, social and environmental management system audits, human rights policy training completion, RBA compliance for rest day requirements and decreasing incident rates.
We work with nonprofits, community leaders and governments to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all. We help protect the environment, support resource conservation and provide disaster relief. We accomplish this through grants from the Flex Foundation, corporate and employee donations and volunteerism. Our multi-year goals in this area cover increasing volunteer hours and the percentage of sites with community activities as well as implementing the worker empowerment training program and Flex Foundation community grants.
We take necessary measures to protect the environment, conserve energy and natural resources, and prevent pollution by applying appropriate management practices and technology. We take actions to protect the environment, including but not limited to strict compliance with material requirements, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, waste, water and energy consumption, and circular economy implementation, among others. Our multi-year goals for environment cover increasing our use of renewable energy, water recycling, waste diversion rate and number of powered homes equivalents and decreasing water consumption, CO2 emissions, and cost of electricity to the grid vs. fossil fuels.
Our corporate compliance program integrates our obligations and commitment to integrity into our day-to-day business practices. We expect our employees and business partners to follow the highest ethical standards. The CoBCE serves as the foundation of our Ethics and Compliance program. We conduct regular internal audits, and we maintain metrics around compliance to continuously benchmark and improve. Implementing in-person training on CoBCE for direct labor employees and increasing CoBCE training for annual completion for indirect labor employees are our integrity multi-year goals targeted for 2020.
We are committed to continuously monitoring and complying with social and environmental requirements across the supply chain. We require our suppliers to have a management system in place to ensure compliance and mitigate potential risks. We also have sustainability supply chain programs in place like on-site sustainability training for suppliers, working hours improvement and labor agent programs which help us to develop our supplier’s competencies for them to comply with the applicable requirements. We measure our progress through two goals, namely increasing out sustainability supplier training and supplier screening on social and environmental criteria.
All of these activities are the subject of our annual sustainability reporting, done in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (“GRI”) standards, and further information can be found in our annual sustainability executive and GRI reports, as well as the Flex 20 by 2020 bi-annual report posted on our website. 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), Section 1502, introduced reporting requirements related to the verification of whether we are directly (or indirectly through suppliers of materials) purchasing the following minerals (“Conflict Minerals”): columbite-tantalite, also known as coltan (the metal ore from which tantalum is extracted); cassiterite (the metal ore from which tin is extracted); gold; wolframite (the metal ore from which tungsten is extracted); or their derivatives, which are limited to tantalum, tin and tungsten; or any other mineral or its derivatives as determined by the U.S. Secretary of State to be associated with financing conflicts in the Democratic Republic of 
11

the Congo or an adjoining country. We work directly with suppliers, industry groups, and customers to comply with the reporting requirements necessary to comply with this law. See "Risk Factors - Compliance with government regulations regarding the use of ‘Conflict Minerals’ may result in increased costs and risks to us." We have filed the required reports on Form SD with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act. 
In addition, we are a founding member and active participant in the RBA’s Responsible Minerals Initiative ("RMI"). RMI promotes the goal of understanding and mitigating social and environmental impacts of extraction and processing of raw materials in supply chains. As an active member of RMI, we leverage direct and indirect partnerships and use international standards, e.g.. Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as our guides. We are committed to responsibly sourcing minerals, in accordance with our Responsible Sourcing Policy, and follow the RMI’s Conflict Minerals data reporting format.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION
Our operations are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We have implemented processes and procedures to ensure that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. We do not believe that costs of compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, operating results, or competitive position. In addition, we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third-party sites. We engage environmental consulting firms to assist us in the evaluation of environmental liabilities associated with our ongoing operations, historical disposal activities and closed sites in order to establish appropriate accruals in our financial statements. We determine the amount of our accruals for environmental matters by analyzing and estimating the probability of occurrence and the reasonable possibility of incurring costs in light of information currently available. 
The imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations, the results of future testing and analysis undertaken by us at our operating facilities, or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters. Additionally, we could be required to alter our operations in order to comply with any new standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations. There can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no issue is currently known. 
We are also required to comply with an increasing number of product environmental compliance regulations focused upon the restriction of certain hazardous substances. The electronics industry is subject to various regulations based on region or country. For example:

• | Restrictions on Hazardous Substances ("RoHS") 2011/65/EU


• | Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment ("WEEE") 2012/19/EU directives


• | The regulation EC 1907/2006 EU Directive REACH ("Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals")


• | China RoHS entitled, Management Methods for Controlling Pollution for Electronic Information Products ("EIPs").

Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including the United States. Our business requires close collaboration with our customers and suppliers to mitigate risks of non-compliance. We have developed rigorous compliance programs designed to meet the needs and specifications of our customers as well as the regulations. These programs vary from collecting compliance or material data from our Flex controlled or managed suppliers to full laboratory testing, and we include compliance requirements in our standard supplier contracts. Non-compliance could result in significant costs and/or penalties. 
RoHS and other similar legislation ban or restrict the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components. In the case of WEEE, although the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their WEEE obligations. Flex continues to monitor developments related to product environmental

compliance and is working with our customers and other technical organizations to anticipate and minimize any impacts to our operations.
EMPLOYEES
Our policies, philosophy and strategies support the inclusion of all people in our working environment. We’re committed to respecting the human rights of our employees and improving their quality of life. We encourage our people to engage in lifelong learning and growth. And we give them opportunities to perform to the best of their abilities.
As of March 31, 2019, our global workforce totaled approximately 200,000 employees including our contractor workforce. In certain international locations, our employees are represented by labor unions and by work councils. We have never experienced a significant work stoppage or strike, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of key managerial and technical employees. The loss of such personnel could seriously harm our business, results of operations and business prospects. To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining such personnel.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We own or license various United States and foreign patents relating to a variety of technologies. For certain of our proprietary processes, inventions, and works of authorship, we rely on trade secret or copyright protection. We also maintain trademark rights (including registrations) for our corporate name and several other trademarks and service marks that we use in our business in the United States and other countries throughout the world. We have implemented appropriate policies and procedures (including both technological means and training programs for our employees) to identify and protect our intellectual property, as well as that of our customers and suppliers. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying value of our intellectual property was not material.
Although we believe that our intellectual property assets and licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it, from time to time third parties assert patent infringement claims against us or our customers. In addition, we provide design and engineering services to our customers and also design and make our own products. As a consequence of these activities, our customers are sometimes requiring us to take responsibility for intellectual property to a greater extent than in our manufacturing and assembly businesses. If and when third parties make assertions regarding the ownership or right to use intellectual property, we could be required to either enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve the issue through litigation. Such license rights might not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, and any such litigation might not be resolved in our favor. Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of the outcome. We also could be required to incur substantial costs to redesign a product or re-perform design services.
From time to time, we enter into intellectual property licenses (e.g., patent licenses and software licenses) with third parties which obligate us to report covered behavior to the licensor and pay license fees to the licensor for certain activities or products, or that enable our use of third-party technologies. We may also decline to enter into licenses for intellectual property that we do not think is useful for or used in our operations, or for which our customers or suppliers have licenses or have assumed responsibility. Given the diverse and varied nature of our business and the location of our business around the world, certain activities we perform, such as providing assembly services in China and India, may fall outside the scope of those licenses or may not be subject to the applicable intellectual property rights. Our licensors may disagree and claim royalties are owed for such activities. In addition, the basis (e.g. base price) for any royalty amounts owed are audited by licensors and may be challenged. Some of these disagreements may lead to claims and litigation that might not be resolved in our favor. Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of the outcome.
