Overview
We are a neurotechnology company focused on neurological wellness. Our purpose is to develop, license or acquire non-implantable technologies targeted at reducing symptoms of neurological disease or trauma.
Our product, known as the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator, or PoNS®, is an innovative non-implantable medical device, inclusive of a controller and mouthpiece, which delivers mild electrical stimulation to the surface of the tongue to provide treatment of gait deficit and chronic balance deficit. PoNS has marketing clearance in the U.S. for use in the U.S. as a short-term treatment of gait deficit due to mild-to-moderate symptoms for multiple sclerosis (“MS”) and is to be used as an adjunct to a supervised therapeutic exercise program in patients 22 years of age and over by prescription only. We began accepting prescriptions for PoNS in the U.S. in March 2022, and commercial sales of PoNS commenced in April 2022. PoNS is authorized for sale in Canada for three indications: (i) for use as a short term treatment (14 weeks) of chronic balance deficit due to mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury, or mmTBI, and is to be used in conjunction with physical therapy, or PoNS TherapyTM; (ii) for use as a short term treatment (14 weeks) of gait deficit due to mild and moderate symptoms from MS and it is to be used in conjunction with physical therapy; and (iii) for use as a short term treatment (14 weeks) of gait deficit due to mild and moderate symptoms from stroke, to be used in conjunction with physical therapy. It has been commercially available in Canada since March 2019. PoNS is authorized for sale as a Class IIa medical device in Australia and we have been seeking a business partner to commercialize and distribute PoNS in Australia.
PoNS Device
The PoNS device is a non-implantable medical device comprised of a controller and a mouthpiece that are connected by a cord. The controller is worn around the neck and the mouthpiece sits on the tongue during treatment. PoNS Therapy, or the “Therapy”, utilizes the PoNS device in conjunction with supervised therapeutic exercise. The Therapy consists of condition specific exercises for movement control, including balance and gait training and breathing and awareness training, which are tailored to focus on the individual patient’s functional deficits. The Therapy is completed over a period of 14 weeks. During the first 2 weeks, the Therapy is mostly administered in a rehabilitation or physical therapy clinic by a PoNS trained therapist and, to a lesser extent, performed at home. The remaining 12 weeks are completed at home with weekly clinic visits to monitor rehabilitation progress, assess improvements and ensure the therapy intensity remains appropriate. When the device is on, the 143 gold-plated electrodes on the mouthpiece send mild electrical signals to the tongue. These impulses stimulate sensory nerves in the tongue that have direct pathways to the brain, through the brain stem. The combination of mild stimulation with supervised therapeutic exercise promotes neuromodulation and likely trigger neuroplastic effects, which potentially lead to functional improvements in balance and gait. During each clinic visit and at the end of the 14 week Therapy, the clinic downloads and reviews the PoNS usage data from the device. This usage data in combination with the detail of the completed treatment assessments gives the clinician and the patient a unique and powerful method to assess treatment progress. The patient initiates their Therapy sessions with the PoNS device initially under the supervision of the clinicians, then through regular check-ins.
Clinical research has shown that translingual neurostimulation activates two major cranial nerves – the trigeminal nerve, and the facial nerve, which creates a flow of neural impulses that are delivered directly into the brain stem and cerebellum – the main control centers for multiple functions including sensory perception and movement. From the brain stem, these impulses travel throughout the brain and may activate or reactivate signaling pathways involved in human function. Researchers believe that supervised therapeutic exercise with neurostimulation can modulate neural activity and initiate adaptive changes in the brain that lead to restructuring and reorganization (neuroplasticity) processes in specific areas of the brain.

Design
The PoNS device is ergonomically designed for patient comfort, is relatively light, contains a replaceable hygienic mouthpiece and a rechargeable battery with built-in technology to allow for tracking of the patient’s usage, including time and intensity of treatments. See Figure 1.
Figure 1
The Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator, PoNS device
The mouthpiece of the PoNS device sits on the front third of the tongue and is held in place by the lips and closed mouth. See Figure 2.
Figure 2
A rechargeable lithium polymer battery with built-in charge safety circuitry provides power. While the voltage and pulse timing to each electrode are programmed into the device and cannot be altered, the user can adjust the stimulus intensity, which is achieved by adjusting the electrical pulse width. The sensation produced by the mouthpiece is similar to the feeling of drinking a carbonated beverage. The patented waveform is specifically designed to minimize the potential for tissue irritation.

Overview of MS and Current Available Treatments
MS is currently classified as an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. The disease attacks the myelin, the protective covering of the nerve necessary for the transmission of nerve impulses through nerve fibers, causing inflammation and often damaging the myelin. Damage to the myelin is variable, depending on the course of the disease, which influences the type and severity of symptoms. MS is unpredictable and can cause symptoms such as extreme fatigue, lack of coordination, weakness, tingling, impaired sensation, vision problems, bladder problems, cognitive impairment and mood changes. Its effects can be physical and emotional with a substantial financial burden. Currently there is no cure and patients with MS experience a progressive decline in health over time. There are a variety of treatments available for MS, some of which are experimental, including pharmaceutical, dietary, and surgical, which may or may not be covered by government or private health insurance.
Findings from a National MS Society study estimate that nearly 1 million people in the U.S. are living with MS of which approximately 25-30% are on Medicare and 93,000 people in Canada are living with MS. The National MS Society estimates that 2.3 million people live with MS globally. The U.S. and Canada have the highest rates of MS, with 309 cases per 100,000 in the U.S., and 291 cases per 100,000 in Canada, respectively. Given the nature of this neurodegenerative disease, these individuals and their caretakers are active in exploring treatment options that may resolve or delay the progression of symptoms. There is also a well-established advocacy framework.
Mobility disability and walking impairment are among the most debilitating consequences of MS with approximately 85% of individuals diagnosed with MS reporting gait impairment as a major limitation in their daily lives. Gait is one of the most important bodily functions for MS patients and gait parameters, such as walking speed and stride length, have been shown to be significant predictors of patient’s independence in daily activities. A survey of 436 patients found that 45% reported a mobility disability in the first month following diagnosis, with upwards of 90% of patients reporting a mobility disability within 10 years of their diagnosis. Additionally, 50-80% of MS patients suffer from balance and gait dysfunction and over 50% fall at least once a year. It has also been reported that unemployment rates in MS patients range from 24-80% with higher rates associated with decreased ambulation and mobility. The Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, reports that individuals with disabilities, like MS, that result in limited mobility are at greater risk for health problems including injury, mental health and depression, overweight and obesity, pain, pressure sores or ulcers and other issues.
A 2016 economic analysis of MS found the total lifetime costs per person with MS to be $4.1 million, with average yearly healthcare costs ranging from $30 thousand to $100 thousand based on the severity of the disease. Since the exact cause of MS is still unknown, there is no known prevention. Although there is no cure for MS yet, immunotherapy can provide disease-modifying effects, and other pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments can manage symptoms. MS medications are designed to lessen the frequency of relapses and slow the progression of the disease, but none have been proven to halt progression of the disease. While there are several disease-modifying medications approved by the FDA to treat MS, only one drug approved by FDA and Heath Canada, Ampyra® (dalfampridine), which is indicated for the improvement of gait speed in conjunction with physical therapy in patients with MS, offers the closest, albeit limited only to speed, comparison to PoNS Therapy on improvement in gait.
Overview of mmTBI and Current Available Treatments
There are an estimated 14.5 million people globally, with over 1.5 million in the U.S. and 350,000 in Canada, living with balance deficit due to mmTBI. Every year in the U.S. and Canada, there are approximately 420,000 and 20,000 newly diagnosed mmTBIs, respectively, resulting in balance deficit. This condition often has a significant impact on one’s quality of life, negatively affecting independence, employability, productivity, mental health and participation in the community. Rehabilitation is often required following a mmTBI for resulting motor, cognitive and behavioral impairments. The current standard of care to address balance issues following a mmTBI is supervised therapeutic exercise. While supervised therapeutic exercise can help to promote balance recovery, individuals are often unable to return to their full function and are left living with a balance deficit.
Prior to the development of the PoNS device, there were no cleared treatments that were clinically indicated to treat balance deficit. A few studies have suggested that supervised therapeutic exercise aimed at improving balance and gait

may be mildly effective for rehabilitation in the mmTBI population. Given the small number of published studies, the small number of patients enrolled in the studies of which we are aware, the varying range of interventional protocols employed in such studies and the lower levels of study design, it is difficult to draw any conclusions regarding the effectiveness and dosing parameters of using supervised therapeutic exercise alone for the treatment of balance deficit following mmTBI. Consequently, we believe that there is a large potential commercial opportunity for the PoNS Therapy in the treatment of balance deficit due to mmTBI. Our goal is to establish the PoNS Therapy as the standard of care for this condition all over the world.
Overview of Stroke in Canada
According to the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System of Canada, Stroke is the third leading cause of death in Canada and the tenth largest contributor to disability-adjusted life years (the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death). About 878,500 Canadian adults aged 20+ have experienced a stroke (2018-2019) and with the population aging, more and more Canadians are at risk. This condition often has a significant impact on the ability on one’s functionality, negatively affecting independence, employability, productivity, mental health and participation in the community. Rehabilitation is required following a stroke for resulting motor, cognitive and behavioral impairments. Most province public health systems in Canada offers stroke rehabilitation services along with private establishments. The potential for commercial opportunity for PoNS in order to support all these public and private establishments is wide. PoNS Therapy offers new opportunities for this type of service by enhancing physical rehabilitation and helping attain the desired goals.
PoNS Clinical Trials and Scientific Support in MS
There are two peer-reviewed published studies reporting on the results of clinical trials comparing active PoNS + PT vs a no frequency pulse sham device (placebo PoNS) + PT in subjects with mild and moderate MS: Tyler et al. Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation 2014, 11:79 and Leonard et al. Multiple Sclerosis Journal Experimental, Translational and Clinical January-March 2017: 19 DOI: 10.1177/ 2055217317690561 
Summary results of the Tyler study in 20 subjects with mild and moderate MS:

● | The study was designed as a between-group comparison of the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) score improvement in10 subjects treated with active PoNS, in conjunction with two weeks of treatment in clinic under supervision of a registered PoNS trainer, and, individually, at home over12-weeks, as compared to 10 subjects treated with placebo PoNS and the same physical therapy regimen, after a total of 14 weeks of treatment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The primary endpoint demonstrated a statistically significant improvement greater that 4 points in the DGI score from baseline in the active PoNS group as compared to placebo at endpoint (Week 14) (p<0.005).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The DGI improvement was already clinically meaningful at 2 weeks of treatment and continued to increase over the following 8 weeks of therapy with an average improvement of 7,7 point, which was then maintained (slightly increased) through week 14.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary results from the Leonard study in 14 patients treated with mild and moderate MS:

● | A statistically significant improvement in the NeuroCom Sensory Organization Test (SOT), a test of subject’s ability to balance, from baseline to week 14 of treatment in 7 subjects treated with active PoNS as compared to the 7 subjects in placebo PoNS group (p=0.001).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Functional MRI data showed an increased blood oxygen dependent level (BOLD) signal in specific brain cortical areas, suggesting that sustained PoNS neuromodulation-induced activation of these cortical areas is likely to trigger a series of adaptive changes (neuroplasticity), expected to rehabilitate existing pathways as well as engage new mechanisms to deliver functional signals to the spinal cord, that may correlate with PoNS therapeutic outcomes observed in the Tyler study.

Summary of Real-World Evidence (RWE) in MS patients treated with PoNS in Canada.

● | Gait deficit treatment outcomes for PoNS-treated individuals are routinely captured through a proprietary validated data capture software. At the time of this retrospective analysis, all data from the MS treated subjects available in our database, specifically 43 MS subjects treated with PoNS for gait deficit in Canada between March 2019 and December 2019, were utilized. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The mean improvement in the FGA (functional gait assessment) from baseline to Week 14 was 4.53 (95% CI 3.35 to 5.72) with a median improvement of 5 points.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A minimal detectable change, greater or equal to 4 point FGA improvement, was met by 56.7% of subjects, most of whom had chronic MS with long durations of the disease.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An analysis of the surveillance safety database demonstrated an excellent safety profile supporting a positive benefit-risk ratio in the real-world clinical utilization setting.

PoNS Clinical Trials and Scientific Support in mmTBI
There are two peer-reviewed published studies reporting on the clinical trials’ results of the PoNS Therapy in people with mmTBI. The first is from our registrational clinical trial (TBI-001): Ptito A, Papa, L, Gregory, K, Folmer, RL, Walker, WC, Prabhakaran, V, Wardini, R, Skinner, KL, Yochelson, M, (2020). “A Prospective, Multicenter Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Translingual Neurostimulation Plus Physical Therapy for the Treatment of a Chronic Balance Deficit Due to Mild-to-Moderate Traumatic Brain Injury”. Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface. The second is from the Long-Term Treatment study in mmTBI Trial: Tyler, ME, Skinner, KL, Prabhakaran, V, Kaczmarek, KA, Danilov, YP (2019). “Translingual neurostimulation for the treatment of chronic symptoms due to mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury.” Archives of Rehabilitation Research and Clinical Translation; 1(304):100026.
PoNS Registrational Clinical Trial in mmTBI
Both studies were double-blind randomized, controlled, aiming to assess the safety and effectiveness of the PoNS Therapy using translingual noninvasive electric stimulation in conjunction with physical therapy performed in clinic for the first two weeks of treatment under supervision of a registered PoNS trainer, and, individually, at home over a short-term period of time (3 or 12 -weeks) for a total of 5- or 14-week therapy, respectively for the short- and long-term studies. Both trials enrolled chronic (> 1 year post head trauma event) TBI subjects with a balance deficit established as sensory organizational test (SOTT) composite score of at least 16 points below the normative value for the participant’s age, who have reached a plateau in their prior physical rehabilitation regimen outcome. According to published clinical trial data, balance impaired TBI subjects treated with physical therapy alone reached an average improvement of 10-13 points in their SOT composite score over a short-term treatment period, an improvement that trended back towards baseline values upon physical therapy discontinuation. In both PoNS studies, participants entered the trial with an average SOT composite score of 40 (1-100 range) indicative of compromised functional balance and were randomized to treatment with PoNS devices that delivered either a high-frequency pulse, or HFP, (25.7 million pulses per 20 minute treatment) or a low-frequency pulse, or LFP, (13,728 pulses per 20 minute treatment). 
In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was constructed for a between-group (HFP-treated and LFP-treated cohorts) comparison based on a greater than 15-point SOT composite score improvement at endpoint. The statistical plans also provided for a key secondary efficacy endpoint that established the treatment response (> 15 points on SOT composite score) from baseline in the pooled HFP and LFP groups at endpoint(s), should the primary measure failed to establish a significant difference between the HFP and LFP treatment groups.
Summary results of the registrational study (Ptito et al. 2020) in mild to moderate TBI subjects with balance deficit: 

● | The trial, launched in 2015 in conjunction with the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, or the USAMRMC and conducted at seven sites in the U.S. and Canada, evaluated 122 randomized subjects.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The primary efficacy endpoint, although failing to demonstrate a between-group difference (p<0.081), showed a higher responder rate in the HFP arm with 71.2% of subjects experiencing a greater than 15-point

improvement on the SOT composite score) as compared to 63.5% in the LFP arm over a 5-week treatment period.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The key secondary efficacy endpoints demonstrated a statistically significant increase (p<0.0005) in SOT composite scores from baseline for the pooled arms with a mean improvement of 18.3 points at two weeks of treatment and of 24.6 points at five weeks of treatment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The primary safety endpoint demonstrated a decrease in the frequency of falls as determined by daily event(s) during the in-clinic phase of the study (week two).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The secondary safety endpoint demonstrated a decrease in the frequency and severity of headaches (by the Headache Disability Index) from baseline to end of treatment (at week 5).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No device-related serious adverse events were observed.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

Summary of the results of the 26-week long-term treatment study (2019) study in people with mmTBI:

● | The study, performed to evaluate understand the durability of response to the PoNS Therapy over a 26-week period, (14 weeks therapy followed by 12-week washout period) conducted at the Tactile Communication Neurorehabilitation Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and sponsored by the U.S. Army, enrolled 22 mild-to-moderate subjects with gait deficit.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The primary efficacy endpoint, although similar to the registrational study, did not show a separation on the composite SOT score improvement between the HFP and LFP groups, confirmed the trend of a higher response rate in the HFP group.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The secondary endpoint showed a 29.8-point improvement of the composite SOT score from baseline in the HFP-treated group at the end of 14 weeks of treatment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | At the end of the 12 week washout period, the participants maintained, on average, the same SOT composite score achieved over the 14 weeks of PoNS Therapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The study confirmed the favorable safety profile shown in the registrational study.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These studies demonstrated that the PoNS Therapy could, on average, allow people with mmTBI who had balance deficit reach, over 14 weeks of treatment, and maintain, over 12 week post-treatment, an SOT composite score within or above the normal range. Furthermore, in a subset of nine participants, who underwent sequential magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, showed meaningful structural and functional changes in specific brain areas consistent with PoNS therapeutic effect on the balance function.
PoNS Clinical Evidence and Scientific Support in Stroke 
Gait deficit treatment outcomes for PoNS-treated individuals were analyzed through a real-world evidence (RWE) retrospective analysis of clinical data from 10 clinical rehabilitation settings in Canada sites. The RWE dataset consisted of 31 consecutive stroke patients that started treatment between March 2019 and November 2022. Patients included in this data set met the criteria for mild to moderate chronic stroke based on the rating of gait (walking) ability. Gait performance was determined using the FGA. FGA at Baseline and at Week 14, as well as changes form Baseline to Week 14 and FGA values at intermediate time points were summarized using means, standard deviations, medians, minimum and maximum values and where appropriate using 95% confidence intervals.
Summary of RWE database analysis in stroke patients treated with PoNS in Canada:

● | The adjusted mean improvement in the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) was 6.74 (95% CI: 4.85 to 8.63) among 30 subjects. The lower bound of this confidence interval exceeds the reported minimum detectable change (MDC) of 4.2 points for improvements in FGA in stroke patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 18 of 26 (69.2%) subjects with complete data at baseline and at Week 14 had improvements larger than the MDC (95% 2-sided binomial exact CI 51.5% to 87.0%).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11




● | Among subjects with evaluable baseline and Week 14 FGA, 25 of 26 (96.2%) subjects were at risk for falling at baseline (FGA<23). Among the 25 subjects with baseline fall risk, 7 (28%) subjects were no longer at risk for falling at Week 14. The one subject not at fall risk at baseline remained not at fall risk at Week 14.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | There was no statistically reliable evidence that effectiveness varies by age, gender, or clinical site.

Regulatory Status Worldwide
Canadian Regulatory Status: mmTBI and MS
On October 17, 2018, we received our Canadian marketing authorization from Health Canada allowing us to commercialize the PoNS device in Canada for use as a short-term treatment (14 weeks) of balance deficit due to mmTBI.
On March 18, 2020, we received marketing authorization from Health Canada allowing us to commercialize the PoNS device in Canada for the treatment of gait deficit in patients with mild and moderate MS symptoms. Our market authorization application comprised objective statistical evidence as well as independently reviewed clinical research analysis. This label expansion expanded our addressable market in Canada to include a patient population seeking treatment options that may resolve or delay the progression of MS gait deficit symptoms.
On March 8, 2023, we received marketing authorization from Health Canada allowing us to commercialize the PoNS device in Canada for use as a short-term treatment of gait deficit due to mild and moderate symptoms from stroke. This expands our addressable market in Canada to include a patient population seeking treatment options that may resolve stroke gait deficit symptoms.
U.S. Regulatory Status: MS
On May 7, 2020, we received Breakthrough Designation for the PoNS device as a potential treatment for gait deficit due to symptoms of MS, to be used as an adjunct to a supervised therapeutic exercise program. The goal of the Breakthrough Devices Program is to provide patients and health care providers with timely access to these medical devices by speeding up their development, assessment, and review, while preserving the statutory standards for premarket approval, 510(k) clearance, and de novo classification and clearance, consistent with FDA’s mission to protect and promote public health.
The Breakthrough Devices Program offers manufacturers an opportunity to interact with the FDA to efficiently address topics as they arise during the premarket review phase, which can help manufacturers receive feedback from the FDA and identify areas of agreement in a timely way. Manufacturers can also expect prioritized review of their submission.
Breakthrough Device Designation does not change the requirements for approval of an application for a marketing authorization.
On March 26, 2021, we received marketing authorization from the FDA of the PoNS device. The PoNS device is indicated for use as a short-term treatment of gait deficit due to mild-to-moderate symptoms of MS and is to be used as an adjunct to a supervised therapeutic exercise program in patients 22 years of age and over by prescription only.
We will continue monitoring the development by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service (“CMS”) of a
 new pathway for coverage of innovative new devices, Transitional Coverage of Emerging Technology (“TCET”), which is replacing the repealed Medicare Coverage of Innovative Technologies (“MCIT”) rule. CMS is expected to share more about TCET with the public for comments in 2023. As we follow the evolution of TCET, we will continue to assess our evidence generation strategy to maximize the potential to gain CMS reimbursement benefits as a result of our Breakthrough designation in MS. While we will continue to monitor this, we will also remain focused on building out our reimbursement strategy for both commercial and government payers. We are still working to understand current Medicare requirements and policies for coverage, coding, and payment of durable medical equipment and assess how the PoNS device may be treated with respect to coding, coverage, and reimbursement under the Medicare program.

12



We also intend to provide broad access and reimbursement for the PoNS Therapy over time through commercial insurers. Prior to the initiation of CMS or broad commercial payer coverage, we anticipate the primary source of sales will be self-pay patients. We expect to support the cost of the PoNS Therapy by offering a cash pay discount, collaborating with third parties to provide self-pay patients with financing options as well as working with advocacy groups and charitable organizations to help self-pay patients access our technology. In general, we anticipate that it will take at least 24 months to obtain broad coverage and reimbursement among government and private payers.
In September 2021, we started activities to set up and implement a new study as part of a Therapeutic Experience Program, or PoNSTEP, with NYU Langone Health as our first Center of Excellence clinical site. During 2022, we added four additional clinical sites to the program and recruitment site information can be found on clinicaltrials.gov. PoNSTEP is a Helius-sponsored, open label observations, interventional multi-center outcome research trial designed to assess adherence to on-label PoNS therapy for improvement in gait deficits with MS in a real-world clinical setting. The study will measure subjects’ adherence to PoNS therapy, which combines the PoNS device with physical therapy, to better understand the relationship between adherence to the treatment regimen and therapeutic functional outcome. The primary endpoint of the study is maintenance of gait improvement from the end of supervised therapy (Phase 1) to the end of unsupervised therapy (Phase 2) in relation to the subject’s adherence to PoNS therapy. The secondary endpoints are improvement of gait and balance deficit over time, and clinical global impression of change. The study will be conducted at eight to ten Centers of Excellence across the U.S., with an estimated average of four PoNS devices per site. Enrollment commenced in the second half of 2022 and is expected to be completed in 2023 with targeted participation of approximately forty to fifty patients with MS.
U.S. Regulatory Status: Stroke
In August 2021, we received Breakthrough Designation for the PoNS device as a potential treatment for dynamic gait and balance deficits due to symptoms from stroke, to be used as an adjunct to a supervised therapeutic exercise program in patients 22 years of age and over. With Breakthrough Designation received, a clinical trial of PoNS therapy in stroke patients in collaboration with Medical University of South Carolina is planned to commence in 2023 with initial patient enrollments beginning in the second half of 2023. 
U.S. Regulatory Status: mmTBI
Our U.S. regulatory strategy initially focused on pursuing de novo classification and clearance of the PoNS device from the FDA for the treatment of balance deficit due to mmTBI.
We submitted a request for de novo classification and clearance of the PoNS device to the FDA for this indication in August 2018. This request was supported by data from two of our clinical trials in mmTBI, including our registrational trial, TBI-001.
In April 2019, we announced that the FDA had completed its review and had denied our request for de novo classification and clearance of the PoNS device for the treatment of balance deficit due to mmTBI. In reaching its conclusion, the FDA noted, via a denial letter, that although the safety profile of the PoNS device is acceptable, the FDA did not have sufficient information to discern the relative independent contributions of the PoNS device and physical therapy on the improvements from baseline. The FDA noted that we could generate additional data to address its concerns and resubmit our application.
In October 2019, we had a pre-submission meeting where the FDA provided feedback needed to help complete the design of a new clinical trial intended to address the FDA’s request for a trial that demonstrates the benefit of the PoNS Therapy compared to physical therapy alone. In January 2020, we received the FDA’s feedback on the minutes from the October 2019 pre-submission meeting. In its feedback, the FDA provided post-meeting notes with specific recommendations regarding the trial design that were not discussed in the October 2019 pre-submission meeting.
Based on the receipt of the FDA’s final minutes from the pre-submission meeting, we are assessing the feasibility of a clinical program to advance the development of a study aimed to obtain clearance for gait and balance deficits in mmTBI if nondilutive financing to fund the program becomes available.

European Regulatory Status
In December 2018, we submitted an application for a CE Mark, which, if approved, would allow us to market the PoNS device in the EU. During the second quarter of 2019, we engaged with regulators in Europe to answer questions that we received from them as part of their review of our PoNS device for CE marking. In August 2019, we withdrew our application from the EU marketing process due to uncertainty in Europe caused by the switch from the Medical Device Directive, or MDD, to the Medical Device Regulation, or MDR, Brexit, and the withdrawal of Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance, our notified body, from the EU notified body business. We have engaged G-MED NA (North America) as our new ISO registrar and will reconsider submitting to the EU when conditions stabilize.
Australian Regulatory Status
In the third quarter of 2019, we initiated the submission of our application to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, or TGA. We supplemented our submission with additional data based on questions supplied to date and provided responses to additional questions during the third quarter of 2020. In November 2021, we received market authorization from the TGA for the sale of PoNS as a Class IIa medical device. In Australia, PoNS is intended for short term use by healthcare professionals as an adjunct to a therapeutic exercise program to improve balance and gait. PoNS is not intended to be used alone without an exercise program.
Exclusive Distribution Agreement
On March 3, 2023, we entered into an Exclusive Distribution Agreement with Health Tech Connex, Inc. (“HTC”) (“Exclusivity Agreement”), whereby, subject to certain terms and conditions, we granted to HTC the exclusive right to provide the PoNS Therapy in the Fraser Valley and Vancouver metro regions of British Columbia, where HTC has operated a PoNS authorized clinic since February 2019. HTC is to purchase the PoNS devices for use in these regions exclusively from us and on terms no less favorable than the then-current standard terms and conditions. This Exclusivity Agreement replaces the previous Clinical Research and Co-Promotion Agreement (“Co-Promotion Agreement”) between the parties dated October 2019. 
Product Development, Manufacturing and Logistics Services
The commercial design of the PoNS device is manufactured and assembled by Key Tronic Corporation (“Key Tronic”), our contract manufacturing partner since 2017, at its facility located in Oakdale, Minnesota. Key Tronic manufactures devices for engineering and design verification testing and for our FDA submission as well as commercial devices for launch inventory. Key Tronic has multiple locations across the U.S., Mexico and China with back-up manufacturing capabilities to help mitigate the risk of a single source provider.

Commercialization
Canadian Commercialization Efforts 
In March 2019, we commenced the commercialization of our PoNS Therapy in Canada, where PoNS became the first and only device authorized by Health Canada for the treatment of balance deficit due to mmTBI. Throughout 2019, we made important progress in advancing and refining our commercialization strategy in Canada building access, awareness and credibility for the PoNS Therapy, including the acquisition of the Heuro Canada operating entity of HTC. These efforts, which were led by our local Canadian commercial team, included the establishment of our authorized clinic network throughout Canada, launching digital marketing campaigns, and building key opinion leader and advocacy networks.
On March 18, 2020, the Company received notification that its Canadian Class II license amendment application for the treatment of gait deficit in patients with mild and moderate symptoms from MS, when used in conjunction with physical therapy, was successful and received marketing authorization for PoNS from Health Canada.
Following in-depth market analysis and field intelligence, our Canadian commercial team began an expansion plan to increase the number of authorized PoNS clinics. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we authorized 11 new clinical locations to have 48 clinic locations across Canada as of December 31, 2022. In addition to continuing to increase the number of clinic locations, we have shifted our focus to driving patient throughput to these clinics. Sales performance in Canada throughout 2021 and into 2022 has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to space restrictions that the provincial governments have imposed as well as the risk tolerance of patients and therapists.
We continue to refine our go-to-market pricing model. In 2020, we implemented a modified pricing approach which is focused on reducing the need for clinics and patients to pay large, upfront costs at the start of treatment. We have also experimented with various promotional pricing programs resulting in lower unit prices for both PoNS system purchases and mouthpieces in order to increase access to the PoNS Therapy and drive market awareness which we believe resulted in an increase in the volume of units sold, beginning in the second half of 2020. We extended the promotional pricing through the end of 2021 including any order placed and accepted, but not fulfilled before December 31, 2021. The promotional pricing was discontinued in 2022 when new pricing was established which focuses on encouraging the clinic in proposing the PoNS therapy to their patient and established a volume discount program that provides a laddered pricing discount to clinics based upon PoNS purchases in an effort to make a difference in the outcomes to their patients and enhance their practice.
The value dossiers for mmTBI and MS that were created in mid-2020 to fully demonstrate in both scientific and financial terms, the merits of PoNS Therapy for claimants are now being utilized along with submissions from clinics on behalf of their patients. The dossiers are provided to our clinics across Canada to submit as part of treatment plans with reimbursement applications to the payer community. Our reimbursement strategy for mmTBI is focused initially on the auto collision insurance and workers’ compensation, or WC, market as well as long-term disability cases. Our reimbursement strategy for MS is focused on commercial insurers/extended health benefits and charitable foundations that support these patient conditions.
As part of our overall PoNS Therapy strategy, we are also gathering comprehensive health economic assessments of treatment outcomes. These data will, in-turn, be used to support our applications for WC, auto insurance and commercial insurance reimbursement initiatives in Canada, the U.S. and other markets around the world. We believe the Canadian commercial experience will be extremely valuable to prepare us for our launches in the U.S. and internationally.
The real-world results from the collective experience of our patients that have completed the 14-week PoNS Therapy, in Canada thus far, have been encouraging. Consistent with what we observed in our two clinical trials, one for 5 weeks and the other for 14 weeks, commercial MS and mmTBI patients demonstrated improvements in balance and gait within the first two weeks followed by continued improvement over the following twelve weeks. The majority of patients had a mean patient adherence to treatment of over 90% and showed significant improvement in their balance and gait with a meaningful clinical difference at the end of their treatment. The consistency of the patient results from our initial commercial experience supports our plans to expand access PoNS Therapy in Canada.

U.S. Commercialization Activities
On March 26, 2021, we received marketing authorization from the FDA for the PoNS device. The PoNS device is indicated for use as a short term treatment of gait deficit due to mild-to-moderate symptoms of MS and is to be used as an adjunct to a supervised therapeutic exercise program in patients 22 years of age and over by prescription only.
Throughout the pre-commercial phase during 2021 and early 2022, we developed and refined our commercial strategy including a focus on payer strategy, both government and commercial, securing distribution licenses in various states and beginning to build relationships with key large neurorehabilitation centers, which focus on treatment of MS patients. We continue to generate data on outcomes of the PoNS Therapy generated from treatment of patients in Canada and ensuring that our scientific data is presented at many of the key national and international neurology and neuromodulation meetings. We believe this scientific dissemination may begin to pave the way to establishing the PoNS Therapy as the standard of care for the treatment of MS-related gait deficit.
We began accepting prescriptions for PoNS in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2022, and our first commercial sales began in April 2022. Presently, PoNS Therapy is not covered by the Medicare program or reimbursed by any other payors in the US.
We have targeted specific Key Opinion Leaders (i.e., neurologists and physiatrists) and their associated neurorehabilitation centers, where selected physical therapists will be trained to deliver the PoNS Therapy. Importantly, this focused strategy will also allow us to measure patient outcomes to determine if they are similar to those observed in our clinical trials. 
In June 2022, we launched the Patient Therapy Access Program (“PTAP”) program, which will provide qualifying patients access to PoNS therapy at a significantly reduced price. To qualify for the PTAP pricing, the patient must provide a letter of medical necessity and consent to the release of their medical records. Because of the significantly reduced price, the patient must also sign a document that prohibits him/her from submitting a reimbursement claim to third-party payers. PTAP participants are also invited to join the Company’s registry program, which is open to all MS patients regardless of their PTAP participation. The PoNS registry is structured to collect important health information and establish the value of PoNS on key therapeutic outcomes, hence supplementing the data collected through clinical trials and real-world data. We began processing orders under the PTAP program in June 2022, which is expected to run through June 2023.
In December 2022, we launched an e-commerce site in the US to make it easier for patients to obtain PoNS systems. Accessed via ponstherapy.com, the site is powered through a new partnership with UpScriptHealth, a leading telehealth company focused on making medications and devices available direct-to-consumer. UpScriptHealth’s platform provides for (1) online health evaluations with qualified medical providers, (2) fulfillment of prescriptions required for PoNS Therapy™ and (3) shipping of PoNS devices directly to the homes of eligible patients in the United States. The UpScriptHealth platform makes it possible for people with MS to have a PoNS device delivered directly to their doorstep.
During 2021, we contracted with an industry consultant to conduct a health economic study of PoNS. Based upon the results of this study and comparing PoNS to other medical devices utilizing similar patented technologies we established a U.S. list price for the PoNS device of $25,700, comprised of $17,800 for the controller and $7,900 for the mouthpiece. We are pursuing commercial insurance coverage and Medicare reimbursement for PoNS within the Durable Medical Equipment, or DME, benefit category. While there are currently no specific Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, or HCPCS, codes to describe the PoNS device or mouthpiece, we intend to use miscellaneous codes – E1399 (Miscellaneous durable medical equipment) and A9999 (Miscellaneous DME supply or accessory, not otherwise specified) until specific HCPCS codes are created. We initially applied for unique HCPCS codes during the third quarter of 2021. In order to address CMS’s request for additional information to “further understand the PoNS device indication for use”, we decided to monitor real-world utilization of PoNS Therapy and collect additional clinical evidence through our ongoing PoNSTEP study and upcoming registry program. Based on consistent reports of positive therapeutic benefits experienced by MS patients through our commercial programs, we plan to re-engage in our communication with CMS leveraging new information that can answer their questions and argue convincingly in favor of obtaining unique 

16



HCPCS codes for PoNS. We expect to interact again with CMS in the second half of 2023. In general, we anticipate that it will take at least 24 months to obtain broad coverage and reimbursement among government and private payers.
Commercialization in Other Markets
We submitted an application for a CE Mark in December 2018. In preparation for our launch in the United Kingdom, or UK, and the EU, we entered into a consulting agreement with a UK-based company with expertise in the development of new services in the healthcare industry to leverage local market insights to develop a comprehensive commercialization strategy and tactical plan for launch of the PoNS Therapy in the UK. As previously described, in August 2019, we withdrew our application for EU market authorization and will revisit our UK and EU commercialization plans as terms of market authorization become clearer under the new regulations.
We submitted an application to the TGA in Australia during the third quarter of 2019. We supplemented our submission with additional data based on questions supplied to date and provided responses to additional questions during the third quarter of 2020. In November 2021, we received market authorization from the TGA for the sale of PoNS as a Class IIa medical device. In Australia, PoNS is authorized as a non-implantable neurostimulator intended for short term used by healthcare professionals as an adjunct to a therapeutic exercise program to improve balance and gait. PoNS is not intended to be used alone without an exercise program. We are working to establish a distribution partner for Australia but have not yet had any commercial sales of PoNS in Australia.
Global Economic Conditions
Generally, worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain, particularly due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased inflation. The general economic and capital market conditions both in the U.S. and worldwide, have been volatile in the past and at times have adversely affected our access to capital and increased the cost of capital. The capital and credit markets may not be available to support future capital raising activity on favorable terms. If economic conditions decline, our future cost of equity or debt capital and access to the capital markets could be adversely affected.
The COVID-19 pandemic that began in late 2019 introduced significant volatility to the global economy, disrupted supply chains and had a widespread adverse effect on the financial markets. Additionally, our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in the overall macroeconomic environment and other economic factors. Changes in economic conditions, supply chain constraints, logistics challenges, labor shortages, the conflict in Ukraine, and steps taken by governments and central banks, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other stimulus and spending programs, have led to higher inflation, which has led to an increase in costs and has caused changes in fiscal and monetary policy, including increased interest rates. Although we may take measures to mitigate these impacts, if these measures are not effective, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. 
Coverage and Reimbursement
Canadian Reimbursement
We believe that traditional life and health payers may be among the earliest to provide coverage and reimbursement for the PoNS Therapy, and therefore, we are focusing on gaining coverage for the PoNS Therapy through them. Life and health encompass long- and short-term disability claims. Because these payers are responsible for both medical expenses and lost wages, they have an incentive to seek ways to help injured employees to return to work. As part of our commercial treatment program in Canada, we will collect both outcomes and return to work data, which we plan to utilize with life and health, provincial workers compensation insurance programs, and property and casualty insurers to demonstrate both the clinical and economic value associated with the PoNS Therapy.
U.S. Reimbursement
In the U.S., we plan to engage with select payer segments to obtain coverage and reimbursement for the PoNS Therapy. We intend to combine evidence from our clinical trials and real-world experience from commercial clinics in Canada to 

17



demonstrate the value proposition of the PoNS Therapy to payers and support favorable coverage and reimbursement decisions.
CMS has indicated that it is developing a rule that would provide a pathway for expedited coverage of technologies under the Medicare program, though that rule has yet to be released. While we will continue to monitor this, we will also remain focused on building out our reimbursement strategy for both commercial and government payers. We continue to work with Medicare requirements and policies for coverage, coding, and payment of durable medical equipment and assess how the PoNS device may be treated with respect to coding, coverage, and reimbursement under the Medicare program.
Competition
The neurostimulation market is predominantly comprised of surgically implanted, invasive technologies that are not directly competitive with our technology. Several neurostimulation companies are large, publicly-traded companies that have a history in the market, have significantly easier access to capital and other resources and have an established product pipeline. The combined clinical research and product development done by the industry, including by us and all of our competitors, is uncovering the beneficial effects of neurostimulation which now establishes neuromodulation as a valid and scientifically supported approach to the treatment of neurological conditions, and accordingly, we expect for competition in the non-implantable space to grow in the future.
However, we believe that we will have the first-mover advantage in the non-implantable neurostimulation space.
We believe that the PoNS Therapy introduces an innovative target and method of stimulation, because targeting the tongue for neurostimulation provides several advantages that competitively distinguish the PoNS Therapy, which are discussed below.
Advantages of the PoNS Therapy
We believe that the PoNS Therapy offers the following benefits over existing neurostimulation technologies:

● | The PoNS device stimulates the trigeminal nerve, which developing science has implicated to be beneficial in some neurological disorder models. Specifically, PoNS stimulates only one branch of the trigeminal nerve, the lingual nerve through its terminals in the tongue, while other technologies stimulate other branches of the trigeminal nerve.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Translingual stimulation also results in stimulating the facial nerve through its chorda tympani branch, which has its nerve terminals in the tongue. Although it’s unclear whether concomitant stimulation of additional nerves is material to the efficacy or safety of PoNS, stimulation of these two cranial nerves triggers selective activation of specific cerebellar, brainstem, and cerebral areas involved in the control of movement and coordination functions. Furthermore, the ability to stimulate more than one nerve at a time differentiates our technology from our competition.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The tongue has an anatomically unique surface with a high density of receptors, a consistently moist and conductive environment, constant pH, constant temperature and a direct connection to the brain through at least two cranial nerves. This a critical feature of how PoNS therapeutic effect is mediated since, similarly to the way most of the pharmacological agents act, translingual stimulation allows direct activation of neural targets that mediate signal transmission to the spinal cord and resulting therapeutic effect.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Scientific studies suggest that the trigeminal cranial nerves offer a high-bandwidth pathway for impulses to directly affect the central nervous system. The trigeminal nerves project directly onto several areas of the brain, primarily the brainstem (trigeminal and solitary nuclei), cerebellum, cochlear nuclei and spinal cord. Secondary targets include the cerebral premotor, motor, and prefrontal cortices, as well as deep brain areas such as the limbic system, basal ganglia and thalamus. We believe that this range of projections will allow impulses to reach central and peripheral targets that regulate dozens of functions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unlike deep brain stimulation devices, implantable vagal nerve devices and other invasive forms of electrical stimulation, the tongue allows for neurostimulation to be delivered via a portable, non-implantable device. This
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18




allows for the concomitant utilization of portable neurostimulation with a wide range of pharmacological therapies and non-pharmacological interventions previously unexplored for neurological rehabilitation.

Government Regulation
Our products under development and our operations are subject to significant government regulation. In the U.S., our products are regulated as medical devices by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. The following is a general description of the review and marketing authorization process of the FDA for medical devices.
FDA Regulation of Medical Devices
The FDA and other U.S. and foreign governmental agencies regulate, among other things, the following activities with respect to medical devices:

● | design, development and manufacturing;
--+---------------------------------------


● | testing, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | clinical trials;
--+-----------------


● | product storage and safety;
--+----------------------------


● | marketing, sales and distribution;
--+-----------------------------------


● | pre-market clearance and approval;
--+-----------------------------------


● | record keeping procedures;
--+---------------------------


● | advertising and promotion;
--+---------------------------


● | recalls and field safety corrective actions;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market approval studies; and
--+----------------------------------


● | product import and export.
--+---------------------------

In the U.S., numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market and marketed. These include the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic, or FD&C Act and the FDA’s implementation of regulations, among others.

21



The FDA Review, Clearance and Approval Processes
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the U.S. requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, or approval of a de novo application. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III— depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Classification of a device is important because the class to which a device is assigned determines, among other things, the necessity and type of FDA review required prior to marketing the device.
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to FDA’s "general controls" for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below.
Class II devices are subject to FDA’s general controls, and any other "special controls" deemed necessary by FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post-market surveillance. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process, though certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process. When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is "substantially equivalent" to a legally marketed device, which in some cases may require submission of clinical data. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the FDA will place the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill much more rigorous premarketing requirements.
Class III devices, consisting of devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by general or special controls. Submission and FDA approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, application is required before marketing of a Class III device can proceed. As with 510(k) submissions, unless subject to an exemption, PMA submissions are subject to user fees. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, must be supported by extensive data, typically including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials.
Our PoNS device is currently regulated as a Class II medical device for use in MS. However, if the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for the PoNS device for balance and gait deficit in stroke, introducing the product for stroke could be delayed or canceled. For example, if the FDA decides that the de novo classification procedures are not the appropriate path to obtain marketing authorizations for the PoNS device in stroke, the FDA may require us to submit a PMA application, which is generally more costly and uncertain and can take from one to three years, or longer, from the time the application is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained. Further, even with respect to those future products where a PMA may not be required, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain 510(k) clearance with respect to our PoNS device.
510(k) Clearance Process
To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, known as a “predicate device.” A legally marketed predicate device may include a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 for which a PMA is not required (known as a “pre-amendments device” based on the date of enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976), a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the 

22



device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate device. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data.
Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) submission for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If the FDA determines that the 510(k) submission is incomplete, the FDA will issue a “Refuse to Accept” letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. Once the 510(k) submission is accepted for review, by regulation, the FDA has 90 days to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a “letter to file” in which the manufacture documents the rationale for the change and why a new 510(k) is not required. However, the FDA may review such letters to file to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
De novo Classification Process
If a previously unclassified new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in July 2012, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) pre-market notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) pre-market notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, the FDA was required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer sought reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer was to include a draft proposal for special controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. The FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
FDA granted de novo classification for the PoNS device for gait deficit in MS, which resulted in Class II classification. In order to be placed in Class II, the FDA required reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the PoNS device. Under Class II, general controls (e.g., premarket notification) and special controls (e.g., specific performance testing) are applicable.

23



Obtaining FDA marketing authorization, de novo classification and clearance, or approval for medical devices is expensive and uncertain, generally takes several years, and generally requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and clinical data. Notwithstanding the expense, these efforts may never result in FDA authorization for commercial distribution. Even if we were to obtain regulatory authorization, it may not be for the uses we believe are important or commercially attractive, in which case we would not be permitted to market our product for those uses.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are typically required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) or de novo submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. If the device is considered a "non-significant risk," IDE submission to FDA is not required. Instead, only approval from the Institutional Review Board, or IRB, overseeing the investigation at each clinical trial site is required.
The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and record keeping requirements.
Additionally, after a trial begins, the sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a clinical trial is completed, there can be no assurance that the data generated during a clinical study will meet the safety and effectiveness endpoints or otherwise produce results that will lead the FDA to grant marketing clearance or approval.

Pervasive and Continuing U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Healthcare Regulation
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

● | establishment, registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or ‘‘off-label’’ uses of cleared or approved products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements related to promotional activities;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the FTC and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. If the FDA determines that promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, it could request that modification of promotional materials or subject a company to regulatory or enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third party payers play a primary role in the recommendation and use of our current products and for any future products for which payment is available under any federal health care program. Arrangements with third party payers, healthcare providers and physicians expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute products. In the U.S., our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the CMS, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. The applicable laws and regulations include the federal health care programs Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, and the federal Civil False Claims Act.
The AKS makes it illegal for any person, including a device manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, or order of a particular device, for which payment 

25



may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to ten years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it.
The Federal Civil False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus significant mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim and the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal AKS also are deemed false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Conduct that violates the False Claims Act also may implicate various federal criminal statutes.
The manufacturing processes associated with medical devices are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, design history file, device history records, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Any failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a company has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:

● | untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | customer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | recall, detention or seizure of our products;
--+----------------------------------------------


● | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products or modified products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operating restrictions;
--+------------------------


● | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal to grant export approval for our products; or
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

Health Canada
After a medical device has been approved for commercial use in Canada, there are a number of Health Canada requirements that must be adhered to including but not limited to the following:

● | annual license renewals;
--+-------------------------


● | labeling regulations, which prohibit “misbranded” devices from entering the market, as well as prohibit on the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” use and impose other restrictions on labeling including truthfulness and accuracy;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | assessment of product modifications for significant changes that would require license amendments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance including medical device reporting, which requires manufacturers report to Health Canada if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other post-approval restrictions or conditions.
--+------------------------------------------------

European Union
We submitted an application for a CE Mark of the PoNS device with our UK based notified body in December 2018. In August 2019, we withdrew our application from the EU marketing process due to notified body activities being delayed by Brexit and the upcoming medical devices regulation changes. We have engaged G-MED NA as our registrar and will reconsider submitting to the EU when conditions stabilize. The successful completion of this review would result in marketing authorization for the sale of the PoNS device in the EU, which now excludes the UK. Some EU member states have additional notification requirements that we expect to satisfy before we launch our PoNS Therapy in those member states. Once the PoNS device is placed into the EU market, post market requirements apply including but not limited to:

● | ensuring that the labeling promotes only approved use(s) of the device;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | assessment of product modifications for significant changes may require license amendments;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance including vigilance reporting, which requires manufacturers report to authorities if our PoNS device caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other post-approval restrictions or conditions.
--+------------------------------------------------

Australia
We submitted our application for marketing authorization to the TGA during the third quarter of 2019. We supplemented our submission with additional data based on questions supplied to date and provided responses to additional questions during the third quarter of 2020. In November 2021, we received market authorization from the TGA for the sale of PoNS as a Class IIa medical device. In Australia, PoNS is indicated for short term use by healthcare professionals as an adjunct to a therapeutic exercise program to improve balance and gait. PoNS is not intended to be used alone without an exercise program.
Data Privacy and Security Laws; Breaches
Medical device companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon “covered entities” (health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, received, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to the U.S. 

27



Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, affected individuals and if the breach is large enough, the media. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, or PHI, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Personally identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC’s guidance for appropriately securing consumers’ personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.
In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which may be more stringent, broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to PHI, than HIPAA, and many of which differ from each other, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, on June 28, 2018, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Additionally, many of the more ambiguous provisions of the CCPA have yet to be fully interpreted and applied, and numerous amendments have been proposed and are working their way through legislature. Consequently, the CCPA currently presents many compliance questions that remain unresolved. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. In addition to the CCPA, numerous other states’ legislatures are considering similar laws that will require ongoing compliance efforts and investment.
In the European Union, as of May 25, 2018, Regulation 2016/676, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, replaced the Data Protection Directive with respect to the processing of personal data in the European Union. The GDPR imposes many requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention and secondary use of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data and additional obligations when we contract third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states to make additional laws and regulations further limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties.
