General

CONMED Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1970.  CONMED is a medical technology company that provides surgical devices and equipment for minimally invasive procedures.  The Company’s products are used by surgeons and physicians in a variety of specialties including orthopedics, general surgery, gynecology, neurosurgery, thoracic surgery and gastroenterology.  Headquartered in Utica, New York, the Company’s 3,100 employees distribute its products worldwide from three primary manufacturing locations.  
We have historically used strategic business acquisitions, internal product development activities and exclusive distribution relationships to diversify our product offerings, increase our market share in certain product lines, realize economies 
2

of scale and take advantage of growth opportunities in the healthcare field. We consider the February 11, 2019 acquisition of Buffalo Filter, LLC, as described below under “Buffalo Filter Acquisition,” to be an example of the type of strategic business acquisition that allows us to diversify our product offerings, realize economies of scale and take advantage of growth opportunities in the healthcare field.

We are committed to offering products with the highest standards of quality, technological excellence and customer service.  Substantially all of our facilities have attained certification under the ISO international quality standards and other domestic and international quality accreditations.

Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are accessible free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our website (http://www.conmed.com) as soon as practicable after such materials have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet site (http:/www.sec.gov) containing reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file with the SEC.

Business Strategy

Our principal objectives are to improve the quality of surgical outcomes and patient care through the development of innovative medical devices, the refinement of existing products and the development of new technologies which reduce risk, trauma, cost and procedure time.  We believe that by meeting these objectives we will enhance our ability to anticipate and adapt to customer needs and market opportunities and provide shareholders with favorable investment returns.  We intend to achieve future growth in revenues and earnings through the following initiatives:

• | Introduction of New Products and Product Enhancements. We continually pursue organic growth through the development of new products and enhancements to existing products. We seek to develop new technologies which improve the durability, performance and usability of existing products. In addition to our internal research and development efforts, we receive new ideas for products and technologies, particularly in procedure-specific areas, from surgeons, inventors and other healthcare professionals. 


• | Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We pursue strategic acquisitions, distribution and similar arrangements in existing and new growth markets to achieve increased operating efficiencies, geographic diversification and market penetration. Targeted companies have historically included those with proven technologies and established brand names which provide potential sales, marketing and manufacturing synergies. This includes the January 4, 2016 acquisition of SurgiQuest, Inc. ("SurgiQuest") and February 11, 2019 acquisition of Buffalo Filter, LLC ("Buffalo Filter") as further described in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 


• | Realize Manufacturing and Operating Efficiencies. We continually review our production systems for opportunities to reduce operating costs, consolidate product lines or process flows, reduce inventory requirements and optimize existing processes. Our vertically integrated manufacturing facilities allow for further opportunities to reduce overhead and increase operating efficiencies and capacity utilization. 


• | Geographic Diversification. We believe that significant growth opportunities exist for our surgical products outside the United States. Principal international markets for our products include Europe, Latin America, Canada and Asia/Pacific Rim. Critical elements of our future sales growth in these markets include leveraging our existing relationships with international surgeons, hospitals, third-party payers and foreign distributors (including sub-distributors and sales agents), maintaining an appropriate presence in emerging market countries and continually evaluating our routes-to-market. 


• | Active Participation in the Medical Community. We believe that excellent working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry enable us to gain an understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives, trends and emerging opportunities. Active participation allows us to quickly respond to the changing needs of physicians and patients. In addition, we are an active sponsor of medical education both in the United States and internationally, offering training on new and innovative surgical techniques as well as other medical education materials for use with our products.

Buffalo Filter Acquisition
On February 11, 2019, we acquired Buffalo Filter and all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Palmerton Holdings, Inc. from Filtration Group FGC LLC (the “Buffalo Filter Acquisition”) for approximately $365 million, in cash, subject to customary adjustments for working capital, cash held by Buffalo Filter at closing, indebtedness of Buffalo Filter, expenses related to the transaction and other related fees and expenses. Buffalo Filter develops, manufactures and markets smoke evacuation technologies that are complementary to our Advanced Surgical portfolio.
We financed the purchase price for the Buffalo Filter Acquisition using a combination of the issuance of $345 million of 2.625% convertible notes due 2024 issued on January 29, 2019 (the Convertible Notes”) and the incurrence of indebtedness under our sixth amended and restated senior secured credit agreement, which closed on February 7, 2019. 
International
Expanding our international presence is an important component of our long-term growth plan. Our products are sold in over 100 foreign countries. International sales efforts are coordinated through local country dealers (including sub-distributors or sales agents) or through direct in-country sales. We distribute our products through sales subsidiaries and branches with offices located in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.  In these countries, our sales are denominated in the local currency and amounted to approximately 34% of our total net sales in 2018.  In the remaining countries where our products are sold through independent distributors, sales are denominated in United States dollars. 
Competition
We compete in orthopedic and general surgery medical device markets across the world. Our competitors range from large manufacturers with multiple business units to smaller manufacturers with limited product offerings. We believe we have appropriate product offerings and adequate market share to compete effectively in these markets. The global markets are constantly changing due to technological advances. We seek to closely align our research and development with our key business objectives, namely developing and improving products and processes, applying innovative technology to the manufacture of products for new global markets and reducing the cost of producing core products. 
The breadth of our product lines in our key product areas enables us to meet a wide range of customer requirements and preferences.  This has enhanced our ability to market our products to surgeons, hospitals, surgery centers, group purchasing organizations ("GPOs"), integrated delivery networks ("IDNs") and other customers, particularly as institutions seek to reduce costs and minimize the number of suppliers.
Marketing
A significant portion of our products are distributed domestically directly to more than 6,000 hospitals, surgery centers and other healthcare institutions as well as through medical specialty distributors.  We are not dependent on any single customer and no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
A significant portion of our U.S. sales are to customers affiliated with GPOs, IDNs and other large national or regional accounts, as well as to the Veterans Administration and other hospitals operated by the Federal government.  For hospital inventory 
5

management purposes, some of our customers prefer to purchase our products through independent third-party medical product distributors.
Our employee sales representatives are extensively trained in our various product offerings. Each employee sales representative is assigned a defined geographic area and compensated on a commission basis or through a combination of salary and commission.  The sales force is supervised and supported by either area directors or district managers.  In certain geographies, sales agent groups are used in the United States to sell our orthopedic products.  These sales agent groups are paid a commission for sales made to customers while home office sales and marketing management provide the overall direction and training for marketing and positioning of our products. Our sales professionals provide surgeons and medical personnel with information relating to the technical features and benefits of our products.
Our health systems organization is responsible for interacting with large regional and national accounts (e.g. GPOs, IDNs, etc.).  We have contracts with many such organizations and believe that the loss of any individual group purchasing contract will not materially impact our business.  In addition, all of our sales professionals are required to work closely with distributors where applicable and maintain close relationships with end-users.
We sell to a diversified base of customers around the world and, therefore, believe there is no material concentration of credit risk.
Manufacturing
Raw material costs constitute a substantial portion of our cost of production.  Substantially all of our raw materials and select components used in the manufacturing process are procured from external suppliers.  We work closely with multiple suppliers to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability.  As a consequence of supply chain best practices, new product development and acquisitions, we often form strategic partnerships with key suppliers. As a consequence of these supplier partnerships, components and raw materials may be sole sourced. Due to the strength of these suppliers and the variety of products we provide, we do not believe the risk of supplier interruption poses an overall material adverse effect on our financial and operational performance. We schedule production and maintain adequate levels of safety stock based on a number of factors, including experience, knowledge of customer ordering patterns, demand, manufacturing lead times and optimal quantities required to maintain the highest possible service levels.  Customer orders are generally processed for immediate shipment and backlog of firm orders is therefore not considered material to an understanding of our business. 
Research and Development
New and improved products play a critical role in our continued sales growth.  Internal research and development efforts focus on the development of new products and product technological and design improvements aimed at complementing and expanding existing product lines.  We continually seek to leverage new technologies which improve the durability, performance and usability of existing products.  In addition, we maintain close working relationships with surgeons, inventors and operating room personnel who often make new product and technology disclosures, principally in procedure-specific areas.  In certain cases, we seek to obtain rights to these ideas through negotiated agreements.  Such agreements typically compensate the originator through payments based upon a percentage of licensed product net sales.  Annual royalty expense approximated $1.5 million, $1.8 million and $2.3 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Amounts expended for Company research and development were approximately $42.2 million, $32.3 million and $32.3 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Intellectual Property
Patents and other proprietary rights, in general, are important to our business. We have rights to intellectual property, including United States patents and foreign equivalent patents which cover a wide range of our products.  We own a majority of these patents and have exclusive and non-exclusive licensing rights to the remainder.  In addition, certain of these patents have currently been licensed to third parties on a non-exclusive basis.  We believe that the development of new products and technological and design improvements to existing products will continue to be of primary importance in maintaining our competitive position.

Government Regulation and Quality Systems
The development, manufacture, sale and distribution of our products are subject to regulation by numerous agencies and legislative bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and comparable foreign counterparts.  In the United States, these regulations were enacted under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments, and the regulations issued or proposed thereunder. 
The FDA’s Quality System Regulations set forth requirements for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records, provide for on-site inspection of our facilities and continuing review by the FDA.  Many of our products are also subject to industry-defined standards.  Authorization to commercially market our products in the U.S. is granted by the FDA under a procedure referred to as a 510(k) pre-market notification.  This process requires us to notify the FDA of the new product and obtain FDA clearance before marketing the device. We believe that our products and processes presently meet applicable standards in all material respects.
Medical device regulations continue to evolve world-wide.  Products marketed in the European Union and other countries require preparation of technical files and design dossiers which demonstrate compliance with applicable international regulations. As government regulations continue to change, there is a risk that the distribution of some of our products may be interrupted or discontinued if they do not meet the country specific requirements.
We market our products in numerous foreign countries and therefore are subject to regulations affecting, among other things, product standards, sterilization, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import laws and onsite inspection by independent bodies with the authority to issue or not issue certifications we may require to be able to sell products in certain countries.  Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA.  The member countries of the European Union have adopted the European Medical Device Directives, which create a single set of medical device regulations for all member countries.  These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in the European Union to maintain quality system certifications through European Union recognized Notified Bodies.  These Notified Bodies authorize the use of the CE Mark allowing free movement of our products throughout the member countries.  Requirements pertaining to our products vary widely from country to country, ranging from simple product registrations to detailed submissions such as those required by the FDA.  We believe that our products and quality procedures currently meet applicable standards for the countries in which they are marketed.
As noted above, our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and foreign regulatory agencies or notified bodies for, among other things, conformance to Quality System Regulation and Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“CGMP”) requirements and foreign or international standards. Refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 
We are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both in the United States and internationally. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We believe our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to comply, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect compliance with these requirements to have a material effect on purchases of property, plant and equipment, cash flows, net income or our competitive position.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 3,100 full-time employees, including approximately 1,890 in operations, 150 in research and development and the remaining in sales, marketing and related administrative support.  We believe that we have good relations with our employees and have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage.  None of our domestic employees are represented by a labor union.
