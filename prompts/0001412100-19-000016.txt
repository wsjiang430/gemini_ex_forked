Item 1. Business.
General Overview
We are a Bermuda-based holding company. Historically, we have focused on serving the needs of regional and specialty insurers in the United States ("U.S."), Europe and select other global markets. We operate internationally providing branded auto and credit life insurance products through insurer partners to retail clients in the European Union ("EU") and other global markets. These products also produce reinsurance programs which are underwritten by our wholly owned, principal operating subsidiary, Maiden Reinsurance Ltd. ("Maiden Bermuda"). We are also presently running off the liabilities associated with our largest client, AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. ("AmTrust"), whose contracts we terminated in early 2019.
Our business has undergone significant changes since our Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") initiated a review of strategic alternatives (the "Strategic Review") in the first quarter of 2018 to evaluate ways to increase shareholder value as a result of continuing significant operating losses and lower returns on equity than planned. This Strategic Review has resulted in a series of transactions that have transformed our operations and materially reduced the risk on our balance sheet. These transactions include:
On August 29, 2018, we entered into a Renewal Rights Agreement (“Renewal Rights”) with Transatlantic Reinsurance Company ("TransRe"), pursuant to which we agreed to sell, and TransRe agreed to purchase, Maiden Reinsurance North America, Inc.'s ("Maiden US") rights to: (i) renew its treaty reinsurance agreements upon their expiration or cancellation, (ii) solicit renewals of and replacement coverages for the treaty reinsurance agreements and (iii) replicate and use the products and contract forms used in Maiden US’s business. The sale was consummated on August 29, 2018. Maiden US continued to earn premiums and remain liable for losses occurring subsequent to August 29, 2018 for any policies in force prior to and as of August 29, 2018, through the date of sale of Maiden US in the transaction described below. We received a fee of $7.5 million paid in cash for the sale of the Renewal Rights, subject to further increases in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
On December 27, 2018, Maiden Holdings North America, Ltd. (“Maiden NA”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the previously announced sale of Maiden NA’s wholly owned subsidiary, Maiden US, to Enstar Holdings (US) LLC ("Enstar Holdings"), pursuant to the terms of the Master Transaction Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2018 (the “US MTA”), by and among Maiden NA and Enstar Holdings and Enstar Group Limited (“Enstar”). Pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the US MTA, Maiden NA sold, and Enstar Holdings purchased, all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Maiden US for gross consideration of $286.4 million, including estimated closing adjustments but subject to final post-closing adjustments. As previously disclosed, pursuant to the terms of the US MTA, (i) Cavello Bay Reinsurance Limited, Enstar Holdings’s Bermuda reinsurance affiliate (“Cavello”), Maiden NA and Maiden Bermuda, entered into a novation agreement, pursuant to which certain assets and liabilities associated with the Company’s U.S. treaty reinsurance business held by Maiden Bermuda were novated to Cavello in exchange for a ceding commission payment of $12.3 million, (ii) Cavello and Maiden Bermuda entered into a retrocession agreement, pursuant to which certain assets and liabilities associated with the Company’s U.S. treaty reinsurance business held by Maiden Bermuda were retroceded to Cavello in exchange for a ceding commission payment of $1.8 million, and (iii) Maiden Bermuda provided Enstar with a reinsurance cover for loss reserve development of $100.0 million in excess of the net loss and LAE recorded as of June 30, 2018, up to a maximum loss of $25.0 million. 
As a result of the decision to divest all of our U.S. treaty reinsurance operations, these operations are now classified as discontinued operations, and except as explicitly described as held for sale or as discontinued operations, and unless otherwise noted, all discussions and amounts presented herein relate to the Company's continuing operations, except for net loss, net loss attributable to Maiden and net loss attributable to Maiden common shareholders.
While the transactions executed in conjunction with the US MTA have significantly reduced revenues in our Diversified Reinsurance segment, we expect to continue to pursue our international reinsurance solutions written through Maiden Bermuda.
As part of the Strategic Review during the fourth quarter of 2018, Maiden Holdings contributed as capital 35% of its ownership in Maiden Bermuda to Maiden NA. Additionally, the proceeds of the sale of Maiden US were partially used by Maiden NA, among other things, to settle inter-company balances due to its Bermuda affiliates and as described below. In December 2018 and January 2019, Maiden NA contributed its proportionate share of capital contributions in the amount of $68.3 million in cash to Maiden Bermuda. Maiden NA also now maintains a portfolio of short-term investments, along with other strategic investments of $148.6 million at December 31, 2018. We believe Maiden NA’s investments will create opportunities to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards ("NOL") which total $208.9 million as of December 31, 2018. These NOL’s are not presently recognized as deferred tax assets as a full valuation allowance is currently carried against them (for further details please see "Note 17. Taxation" included under Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10–K). Taken together, the Company believes these measures should generate additional income for Maiden NA in a tax-efficient manner while sharing in the improvement in profitability we anticipate in Maiden Bermuda as a result of the measures enacted in the Strategic Review. 
As part of the Strategic Review, which included assessing our capital position, solvency ratios and liquidity, we also evaluated the business within our other principal reporting segment, the AmTrust Reinsurance segment. As a result of this continuing analysis, a series of transactions were entered into at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 which will eliminate new premiums written in this segment and have placed the AmTrust Reinsurance segment into run–off. These transactions include the following:
On December 31, 2018, Maiden Bermuda entered into, effective January 1, 2019, a Partial Termination Amendment (the “Partial Termination Amendment”) with AmTrust, through its wholly owned subsidiary AmTrust International Insurance, Ltd. (“AII”), by which the parties agreed to amend the Amended and Restated Quota Share Agreement between Maiden Bermuda and AII, originally entered into on July 1, 2007 (the “AmTrust Quota Share”) and subsequently amended, that is currently in-force and was set to expire on June 30, 2019.  The Partial Termination Amendment provides for the cut-off of the ongoing and unearned premium of AmTrust’s Small Commercial Business (specifically workers’ compensation, general liability, umbrella liability, professional liability and cyber liability insurance coverages) and U.S. Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty as of December 31, 2018, with 
 2

the remainder of the AmTrust Quota Share remaining in place.  The Partial Termination Amendment resulted in Maiden Bermuda returning approximately $716.1 million in unearned premium to AmTrust, which nets to approximately $480.0 million after consideration of ceding commission and brokerage, subject to adjustment.  In addition, Maiden Bermuda will pay AmTrust five additional percentage points of ceding commission on the remaining unearned premium over the term of the remaining contract. 
Subsequently, on January 30, 2019, Maiden Bermuda and AmTrust, through its wholly owned subsidiaries AII, AmTrust Europe Limited ("AEL") and AmTrust International Underwriters Limited DAC ("AIU DAC"), agreed to terminate on a run-off basis (i) the AmTrust Quota Share; and (ii) the Quota Share Reinsurance Contract among Maiden Bermuda, AEL and AIU DAC, originally entered into on April 1, 2011, by which AEL cedes 20% and AIU DAC cedes 40% to Maiden Bermuda of AmTrust’s European Hospital Liability business ("European Hospital Liability Quota Share"). Each termination was effective as of January 1, 2019. 
On March 1, 2019, we terminated the Master Transaction Agreement with Enstar dated as of November 9, 2018 (the “Old LPT MTA”) and simultaneously signed a new agreement (the "New LPT/ADC MTA") pursuant to which an Enstar subsidiary will assume liabilities for loss reserves as of December 31, 2018 associated with the quota share reinsurance agreements between Maiden Bermuda and AmTrust in excess of a $2.44 billion retention up to $675.0 million. The $2.44 billion retention will be subject to adjustment for paid losses since December 31, 2018. The New LPT/ADC MTA and associated pending reinsurance agreement, which is subject to regulatory approval, will provide Maiden Bermuda with $175.0 million in adverse development cover over its carried AmTrust reserves at December 31, 2018. Management has assessed that the associated reinsurance agreement to the New LPT/ADC MTA meets the criteria for risk transfer and will be accounted for as retroactive reinsurance. Cumulative ceded losses exceeding $500.0 million would result in a deferred gain which would be recognized over the settlement period in proportion to cumulative losses collected over the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoverable. Consequently, cumulative adverse development subsequent to December 31, 2018, in excess of $500.0 million, may result in significant losses from operations until those periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings. 
Our entry into a New LPT/ADC MTA with Enstar, which is smaller than the previously announced Old LPT MTA, reflects the cumulative positive impact of measures already implemented since the third quarter of 2018. Under the Old LPT MTA, Maiden and Enstar were to enter into a retrocession agreement to effect a loss portfolio transfer in which an Enstar entity would assume loss reserves of approximately $2.675 billion associated with quota share reinsurance contracts that Maiden Bermuda has with AmTrust.  That proposed retrocession was to apply to losses arising and/or claims made on or prior to June 30, 2018. 
Maiden Bermuda failed to meet the requirements to hold sufficient capital to cover its economic capital requirement (“ECR”) as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018. Please refer to Item 1. "Business - Regulatory Matters" for further background on capital requirements. We took actions to remediate the breach including capital injections by Maiden Bermuda's shareholders (Maiden Holdings and Maiden NA) of $125.0 million on December 31, 2018 and $70.0 million in January 2019. As a result of the actions taken in the Strategic Review during 2018 and 2019, and pending finalization of the New LPT/ADC MTA and associated reinsurance agreement, we estimate that the Company and Maiden Bermuda will have sufficient capital in excess of the respective ECR requirements and that this position should improve throughout 2019. 
The New LPT/ADC MTA, in combination with these previous measures, are expected to continue to further strengthen our capital position and solvency ratios throughout 2019. In addition, the New LPT/ADC MTA provides us with more investable assets and reserve protection compared to the Old LPT MTA which will further support our improving solvency ratios. The Company remains actively engaged in ongoing discussions with the Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”) regarding the formulation of its longer term business plan, which will require the approval of the BMA for any new reinsurance business.
We continue to provide reinsurance in Europe through Maiden Bermuda in our Diversified Reinsurance segment on a renewal basis only at the present time. Internationally, we continue to provide insurance sales and distribution services through our wholly owned subsidiary, Maiden Global Holdings, Ltd. ("Maiden Global") and its subsidiaries. Maiden Global primarily focuses on providing branded auto and credit life insurance products through insurer partners to retail clients in the EU and other global markets. These products also produce reinsurance programs which are underwritten by Maiden Bermuda. Certain international credit life business is written on a primary basis by Maiden Life Försäkrings AB ("Maiden LF") and general insurance business is written on a primary basis by Maiden General Försäkrings AB ("Maiden GF"). 
On January 10, 2019, we completed the sale of AVS Automotive VersicherungsService GmbH (“AVS”) and related European subsidiaries to Allianz Partners (“Allianz”) as part of its Strategic Review. AVS, organized under the laws of Germany, operates as an insurance producer in Germany and was a wholly owned subsidiary of Maiden Global prior to its sale. 
Prior to the transactions associated with the Strategic Review, we had entered into a series of significant transactions. For additional details of our strategic capital markets transactions prior to 2018, please refer to our Annual Reports on Form 10–K for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
We have also entered into a series of capital transactions that enabled us to support our prior reinsurance operations while enhancing our capital position and lowering our cost of capital. The most recent capital transactions include a public offering of $150.0 million Preference Shares – Series D ("Preference Shares – Series D") on June 15, 2017 and the subsequent redemption of the $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.0% notes maturing in 2042 (the "2012 Senior Notes").
Further details of these and other capital transactions are discussed in the Capital Resources section of Item 7 "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" as well as the related discussion in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements specifically "Note 11. Long Term Debt" and "Note 14. Shareholders' Equity" included under Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10–K.

Business Strategy 
To date we have not yet attained our targeted returns and fell significantly short of these goals in 2016 and 2017. As a result of this shortfall, our Board initiated the Strategic Review. We believe that the transactions and initiatives taken as a result of the Strategic Review have substantially improved our capital position and will return us to operating profitability. We have materially reduced our premium written and expect to continue to re–evaluate our operating strategy during 2019 while leveraging the significant assets we retain, particularly compared to the improved reserving position we believe we have achieved. 
Historically, we had judged our efficient balance sheet and low volatility business as the primary reasons our returns had generally exceeded industry averages, despite a declining investment yield environment since our founding. Our ability to achieve our targeted returns was initially impacted by a significantly higher cost of capital which we improved in recent years. 
Our goal had been to leverage the competitive strengths of our organization and capital structure to generate stable long term operating returns on common equity in excess of 15%. We sought to accomplish this by becoming a premier global preferred provider of customized reinsurance and capital products and services to regional and specialty insurance companies. 
Despite what we believed was an appropriate strategic focus, our recent operating losses led our Board to implement the Strategic Review and we are retaining aspects of the business we believe are not rating sensitive, are profitable and can grow while re–evaluating our strategy.
Our future results, and our ability to generate our targeted return on capital, may be additionally impacted by risks and trends set forth in Item 1A, "Risk Factors", and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our Principal Operating Subsidiaries
 Maiden Bermuda, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is a registered Class 3B Bermuda reinsurance company that began operations in June 2007. Senior management and all of the staff of Maiden Bermuda operate from and are based in our Bermuda headquarters.
Maiden NA is our wholly owned U.S. holding company and is domiciled in the state of Delaware. Maiden US, a licensed property and casualty insurance company domiciled in the state of Missouri, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Maiden NA. Maiden US was sold on December 27, 2018 as noted in the "General Overview" section above. 
Maiden Global, a wholly owned subsidiary of Maiden Holdings, operates as a reinsurance services and holding company. Maiden Global is organized under the laws of England and Wales. Maiden LF and Maiden GF, both wholly owned subsidiaries of Maiden Holdings, are insurance companies organized under the laws of Sweden and write credit life insurance and general insurance, respectively, on a primary basis in support of Maiden Global’s business development efforts. AVS, organized under the laws of Germany, operated as an insurance producer in Germany and was a wholly owned subsidiary of Maiden Global until its sale to Allianz Partners in January 2019.
Our Reportable Segments 
Our business for most of 2018 consists of two reportable segments: Diversified Reinsurance and AmTrust Reinsurance. As a result of the strategic decision to divest all of our U.S. treaty reinsurance operations as discussed above, we have revised the composition of these reportable segments. Our Diversified Reinsurance segment now only consists of a portfolio of predominantly property and casualty reinsurance business focusing on regional and specialty property and casualty insurance companies located primarily in Europe. Our AmTrust Reinsurance segment includes all business ceded by AmTrust to Maiden Bermuda, primarily the AmTrust Quota Share and the European Hospital Liability Quota Share. Both contracts in the AmTrust Reinsurance segment have been terminated effective January 1, 2019. In addition to our reportable segments, the results of operations of the former NGHC Quota Share segment (which consisted of a quota share reinsurance agreement with a subsidiary of National General Holdings Corp.) have been included in the "Other" category. Previously, the underwriting results associated with the discontinued operations of our U.S. treaty reinsurance business were included within the Diversified Reinsurance segment and the operating results associated with the remnants of the U.S. excess and surplus business were included within the "Other" category. These are now excluded and all prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to this new presentation.
Financial data relating to our two segments is included in Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 3. Segment Information" included under Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Segment Information" included under Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
In a quota share reinsurance arrangement (also known as pro-rata reinsurance, proportional reinsurance or participating reinsurance), the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the original premiums of the reinsured. In return, the reinsurer assumes a proportional share of the losses incurred by the cedant. The reinsurer pays the company a ceding commission, which is generally based on the ceding company’s cost of acquiring the business being reinsured (including broker commissions, premium taxes, assessments and miscellaneous administrative expenses) and may also include a profit sharing arrangement. Under quota share arrangements, ceding commission can be adjustable and subject to minimum and maximum levels based upon loss experience which potentially reduces earnings volatility for the reinsurer under such arrangements. 
Excess of loss (or non-proportional) reinsurance indemnifies the reinsured against all or a specified portion of losses on underlying insurance policies in excess of a specified amount, which is called a level, retention or attachment point. Excess of loss business is written in layers and a reinsurer or group of reinsurers accepts a band of coverage up to a specified amount. Facultative reinsurance (proportional or non-proportional) is the reinsurance of individual risks. The reinsurer separately rates and underwrites each risk rather than assuming all or a portion of a class of risks as in the case of treaty reinsurance. 
Nearly all of our gross premiums written is generated by quota share reinsurance contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, 99.8%, 99.5% and 99.9%, respectively, of our consolidated gross premiums written were derived from quota share reinsurance contracts. 
Diversified Reinsurance Segment
General 
Maiden Bermuda writes treaties on both a quota share basis and excess of loss basis outside the U.S. The net premiums written by our Diversified Reinsurance segment's operating subsidiaries, after intercompany reinsurance, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

We entered into a retrocessional quota share agreement with a highly rated global insurer effective January 1, 2015 which impacted net premiums written in 2017 and 2016, and was commuted by Maiden Bermuda effective July 1, 2018.
A combination of general market and competitive conditions, along with their underlying financial performance and capital levels including those considered by rating agencies and regulators, often influence reinsurance purchasing decisions of individual ceding companies. Please refer to Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a discussion on the performance of our Diversified Reinsurance segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Maiden Bermuda has focused on developing a portfolio of assumed reinsurance in Europe and globally since the advent of Solvency II. Maiden Bermuda has also enhanced its ability to develop this business by offering additional products that support insurers' regulatory capital. Maiden Bermuda began writing treaty reinsurance contracts under this initiative (referred to as "European Capital Solutions") in 2016 and through 2018 on a pan–European basis as insurers deployed more active capital management strategies in response to these rules. The net premiums written in European Capital Solutions for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

($ in thousands) | Net Premiums Written | | Net Premiums Written | | Net Premiums Written | 
Net premiums written | $ | 42,753 | | | $ | 13,595 | $ | 9,067

As a result of our A.M. Best rating being downgraded to B++ (Good) with negative outlook and implications in November 2018, the European Capital Solutions business was adversely affected and a significant amount of this business was either non–renewed at January 1, 2019 or was terminated pursuant to contractual provision in the underlying reinsurance contracts. Presently, a limited number of in-force contracts remain, including terminated contracts which operate on a risks attaching basis and have not yet reached full termination.
Additionally, Maiden Global’s business development teams partner with automobile manufacturers, dealer associations and local primary insurers to design and implement point of sale insurance programs which generate revenue for the auto manufacturer and insurance premiums for the primary insurer ("IIS business"). Typically, the primary insurer agrees to reinsure an agreed upon percentage of the underlying business to Maiden Bermuda as part of the overall arrangement. Maiden Bermuda is generally not obligated to underwrite the original equipment automobile manufacturers' (the "OEM's") programs that Maiden Global designs. 
 Net premiums written for the IIS business were written in the following countries:

We also generate fee income when Maiden Global participates in transactions and collects a fee for designing and facilitating the sale of insurance programs; approximately 67.0% of our fee income is generated by AVS and its subsidiaries in Germany and Austria through its point of sale producers in select OEM's dealerships. On January 10, 2019, we completed the sale of AVS to Allianz. In addition to a fee for the sale of AVS, we entered into a three–year quota share reinsurance agreement with Allianz for certain German automobile policies that we have historically reinsured. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the fee income was earned in the following locations:

Strategy 
In 2018, our Diversified Reinsurance segment reinsured property and casualty lines of business, but de-emphasized lines of business which we considered more volatile, and we historically have not offered traditional catastrophe reinsurance on a stand-alone basis. As discussed herein, we have substantially transformed our business as a result of the Strategic Review and continue to re–assess our forward operating strategy as we complete the Strategic Review. We offer reinsurance on both a quota share and excess of loss basis. Our primary focus is regional and specialty clients who rely on reinsurance for capital support and/or to reduce their risk. The majority of our clients were regional or super-regional insurance companies or specialty insurers.

AmTrust Reinsurance Segment
General 
AmTrust is our largest client and is a multinational specialty property and casualty insurance holding company with operations in the U.S., Europe and Bermuda. In January 2019, we terminated both of the reinsurance contracts that comprise this segment and apart from certain unearned premiums in the AmTrust Quota Share and the European Hospital Liability Quota Share that will be earned subsequent to 2018, we will have no new premium written within this segment in 2019. Michael Karfunkel, George Karfunkel and Barry Zyskind (the Company's non-executive chairman) were our Founding Shareholders. Michael Karfunkel passed away on April 27, 2016, and his shares are now controlled by his wife, Leah Karfunkel. Leah Karfunkel and George Karfunkel are directors of AmTrust, and Barry Zyskind is the president, chief executive officer and chairman of AmTrust. Leah Karfunkel, George Karfunkel and Barry Zyskind own or control approximately 53.9% of the ownership interests of Evergreen Parent GP, LLC, which is the ultimate parent of of AmTrust.
Through our reinsurance agreements with AmTrust, in 2018 we reinsured specific lines of business within the following AmTrust business segments: 

• | Small commercial business insurance, which includes U.S. workers’ compensation, commercial package and other low-hazard property and casualty insurance products;


• | Specialty risk and extended warranty coverage for consumer and commercial goods and custom designed coverages, such as accidental damage plans and payment protection plans offered in connection with the sale of consumer and commercial goods, in the U.S., U.K. and certain other global markets and European hospital liability; and


• | Specialty program which includes package products, general liability, commercial auto liability, excess and surplus lines programs and other specialty commercial property and casualty insurance to a narrowly defined, homogeneous group of small and middle market companies.

AmTrust Quota Share 
Under the AmTrust Quota Share with AII, effective July 1, 2007 and through 2018, we reinsured 40% of AmTrust’s premium written, net of reinsurance with unaffiliated reinsurers, relating to all lines of business that existed on the effective date. We also had the option to reinsure additional programs, in addition to the original lines of business entered into by AmTrust since the effective date of the AmTrust Quota Share. As AmTrust expanded into new lines of business, pursuant to the terms of the AmTrust Quota Share, we had selectively added some of those lines and opted not to participate in others. Consequently our share of AmTrust's overall gross premiums written declined below 40% over time. 
On December 31, 2018, Maiden Bermuda entered into the Partial Termination Amendment with AII by which the parties agreed to amend the AmTrust Quota Share between Maiden Bermuda and AII, originally entered into on July 1, 2007 and subsequently amended, that was set to expire on June 30, 2019.  The Partial Termination Amendment provides for the cut-off of the substantial majority of the ongoing and unearned premium of AmTrust’s Small Commercial Business (specifically, workers' compensation, general liability, umbrella liability, professional liability (including cyber liability)) insurance coverages and U.S. Extended Warranty and Specialty Risk as of December 31, 2018.  The Partial Termination Amendment resulted in Maiden Bermuda returning approximately $716.1 million in unearned premium to AmTrust, which nets to approximately $480.0 million after consideration of ceding commission and brokerage, subject to adjustment.  The Partial Termination Amendment was effective January 1, 2019.
On January 30, 2019, Maiden Bermuda and AII agreed to terminate on a run-off basis the AmTrust Quota Share. The termination was effective as of January 1, 2019 and discussed in "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 18. Subsequent Events" included under Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in further detail.
European Hospital Liability Quota Share
On April 1, 2011, Maiden Bermuda entered into the European Hospital Liability Quota Share with AEL and AIU DAC to cover those entities' medical liability business in Europe, in particular, Italy and France. Maiden Bermuda pays a ceding commission of 5.0%. Effective January 1, 2012, the Company's maximum limit of liability is 40% of €10 million, previously 40% of €5 million, per original claim for any one original policy. Effective July 1, 2016, the contract was further amended such that Maiden Bermuda assumes from AEL 32.5% of the premiums and losses of all policies written or renewed on or after July 1, 2016 until June 30, 2017 and 20% of all policies written or renewed on or after July 1, 2017. The European Hospital Liability Quota Share had a term of one year and automatically renews for further one year terms thereafter, unless either party notifies the other of its election in writing not to renew not less than four months prior to the end of any such term. 
On January 30, 2019, the European Hospital Liability Quota Share was terminated on a run-off basis. The termination was effective as of January 1, 2019 and is discussed in "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 18. Subsequent Events" included under Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in further detail.

Risk Management 
General 
Our Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") framework reflects the ‘three lines of defense’ approach to risk management, which involves (1) risk owners having responsibility for identifying and managing risks; (2) the ERM Committee providing global tools and policies; and (3) internal audit performing independent reviews. Our Board has overall responsibility for oversight of the ERM program and has delegated this oversight to its Audit Committee.
 7

Our ERM Committee monitors and oversees the risk environment and provides direction to mitigate, to an acceptable level, the most significant and material risks that may adversely affect our ability to achieve our goals. The ERM Committee establishes appropriate risk parameters and tolerances, performs risk assessments, continually reviews factors that may impact our organizational risk and develops and implements strategies and action plans to mitigate key risks. 
Our ERM program is designed to achieve the following:

• | Establish a process to assess strategies and business decisions on a risk/reward basis;


• | Establish a risk governance structure with clearly defined roles and responsibilities;


• | Identify and assess all material risks from internal and external sources;


• | Manage risks within our risk appetite; and


• | Effective review and reporting of major loss events.

All our employees and risk owners are required to assist with the identification of risks, creation of appropriate responses to risks, and maintain them within the risk appetite and tolerances that the ERM Committee believes are necessary to achieve our business strategies and objectives. The mitigation of risks is achieved through the application and operation of controls, transferring of risk or tolerating risks within risk appetite.
Our internal audit department assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management framework and mitigating controls and coordinates risk-based audits to evaluate and address risk within targeted areas of our business. The core functions of this department are to (1) assess the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control systems; (2) coordinate risk-based audits and compliance reviews; and (3) carry out other initiatives to evaluate and address risk within targeted areas of our business. Internal audit integrates testing of the risk management framework into its annual test plans. 
Our Audit Committee, comprised solely of independent directors, meets at least quarterly to assess whether management is addressing risk issues in a timely and appropriate manner. The Audit Committee receives a quarterly report on capital and risk management. Our risk appetite and tolerances have been formally approved by the Audit Committee. 
Our Audit Committee also reviews the Group Solvency Self-Assessment ("GSSA") which is required to be filed annually with the BMA and used to understand current and prospective risks and the associated capital requirements. The GSSA is an integral part of our risk management framework and reflects our risk tolerance and overall business strategy. The GSSA documents our internal self-assessment of capital. On a group basis and for our operating entities, we monitor our capital position relative to our regulatory requirements. Our major risks are insurance related - both premium risk and reserve risk, reflecting the possibility that our pricing may be too low or our reserving levels may not be sufficient. Other primary risk exposure areas are investment risk, credit risk and operational risk. Internal controls and ERM can provide a reasonable but not absolute assurance that our control objectives will be met. The possibility of material financial loss remains in spite of our ERM efforts. 
Insurance Risk
The key risks for us due to the nature of our business relate to insurance activities. Insurance risk is comprised of underwriting risk, catastrophe risk and reserving risk.
1. Underwriting Risk
Specific risks that could unfavorably affect our performance and erode capital include: 

• | Insufficient premiums to cover future incurred losses due to inaccurate pricing, inappropriate risk selection, or both;


• | Pressure on prices due to place in insurance cycle, the inability to renew existing accounts or write new accounts at appropriate pricing;


• | Acceptance of risks outside of Maiden’s risk appetite, underwriting guidelines or deviation from prescribed pricing targets could deliver results with different performance or volatility than expected;


• | Changes in loss cost trends which are observed after contract pricing;


• | Changes in cedant claims handling or underwriting procedures which mask actual cedant performance; and


• | Losses from terrorism and other catastrophe related events may exceed our expectations.

Internal underwriting controls are established by our underwriting executives. Underwriting authority is delegated to the managers in each business segment to underwrite in accordance with prudent practice and an understanding of each underwriter’s capabilities. In accordance with our underwriting guidelines, underwriting authorities could be delegated to underwriting teams as well as individual underwriters. Our targeted performance goals and guidelines are regularly reviewed by management to reflect changes in market conditions, interest rates, capital requirements and market-expected returns. 
We have a disciplined approach to underwriting and risk management that relies heavily upon the collective underwriting expertise of our management and staff. Before developing a reinsurance proposal, we consider the appropriateness of the client, including the quality of its management, its financial stability and its risk management strategy. In addition, we require each program to include significant information on the nature of the perils to be included and detailed exposure and loss information, including rate changes and changes in underwriting and claims handling guidelines over time. Whenever possible, we conduct an on-site audit of the client’s operations prior to quoting. If the customer and business meets our underwriting criteria, we then develop a proposal which contemplates the prospective client’s needs, that account’s risk/reward profile, as well as our corporate risk objectives. We have fully integrated our internal claims, underwriting and actuarial pricing staff into the underwriting and 
 8

decision making process. We underwrite and accept property and casualty reinsurance business, accident and health reinsurance business and credit life insurance business. 
In addition to the above technical and analytical practices, our underwriters use a variety of means, including specific contract terms, to manage our exposure to loss. Specific terms include occurrence limits, adjustable ceding commissions and premiums, aggregate limits, reinstatement provisions and other loss sensitive features. Additionally, our underwriters use appropriate exclusions, terms and conditions to further eliminate or reduce particular risks or exposures that our underwriting teams deem to be outside of the intent of the coverage we are willing to offer.
 In limited cases, the risks assumed by us are partially reinsured with other third party reinsurers. Reinsurance ceded varies by segment and line of business based on a number of factors, including market conditions. The benefits of ceding risks include reducing exposure on individual risks and/or enhancing our capital position. Reinsurance ceded does not relieve us of our obligations to our policyholders. We remain liable to the extent that any reinsurance company fails to meet its obligations. In the event that one or more of the reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations under these reinsurance agreements, we would not realize the full value of the reinsurance recoverable balances. 
We use retrocessional agreements to mitigate volatility and to reduce our exposure on certain reinsurance risks and to provide capital support. We remain liable to our cedants to the extent that the retrocessionaires do not meet their obligations under retrocessional agreements, so we retain credit risk in all cases and to aggregate loss limits in certain cases. We maintain a credit risk review process that identifies authorized acceptable reinsurers and retrocessionaires and have no impaired balances. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1.7 million (2017 - $24.9 million) of reinsurance recoverable under such agreements. 
2. Catastrophe Risk
While we do not write catastrophe reinsurance contracts, certain risks we reinsure are exposed to catastrophic loss events. Maiden aims to limit the probable maximum loss ("PML") of capital and income from a single event and from multiple events in any one year. Our internal tolerance is that our modeled one-in-250 year return period catastrophe occurrence loss (single event) must be less than 50% of our planned operating income and our modeled annual aggregate loss (multiple events) must be less than 75% of our planned operating income. 
3. Reserving Risk
 Reserving risk is the risk that loss and loss adjustment expense ("loss and LAE") reserves are not sufficient to cover all of our policy obligations. Drivers include reporting lags inherent in reinsurance relationships, compounded by third party administrator lags in reporting to insurers, adequacy of ceding company’s claim estimates, future trends, unanticipated events, and normal volatility causing a range of uncertainty around where ultimate loss will land when all claims are closed and settled. Reserving risk includes potential time delays in being aware of significant developments or reserve deterioration from ceding companies. Any inaccurate assumptions used in the selection of the expected loss ratio, whether they be due to fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of claims and claim settlements relative to expectations, loss and exposure trends or underlying client pricing, could cause our initial reserve selections to be incorrect as the pricing expected loss ratio is used in our reserving process. 
Establishing adequate reserves for loss and LAE constitutes a significant risk for us. We manage the risk inherent in estimating the Company’s loss reserves in a variety of ways. Reserve reviews are performed on a quarterly basis by credentialed actuaries. As part of the reserving process, observations from the review are discussed with the production teams individually to allow for the discussion of account specific information that may be obtained by those managing the business. The reserves are reviewed by our reserving committee and approved by our booking committee. Loss provisions are reviewed and approved by senior management at the recommendation of the reserving committee. The Company conducts operational and claims audits of ceding companies on a regular basis.
Further details on how we manage the risk inherent in estimating our loss reserves are set out later in Item 1. "Reserve for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses." 
Investment Risk Management
Investment risk includes the risk of loss in our investment portfolio potentially caused by fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates and inflation on both assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2018, Maiden’s investment portfolio of $4.1 billion consisted almost entirely of fixed income securities. 
Our investment policy is an important component of our overall business model and is designed to preserve capital, provide significant liquidity, and produce sufficient investment income to sustain and grow net income while supporting our clients' needs. In order to limit our credit risk exposure, the investment policy is to invest almost exclusively in high grade marketable fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalents and to achieve diversification through limits on holdings of individual securities. We monitor and manage exposure to asset types and economic sector. We manage interest rate risk by establishing and managing targets in the investment portfolio for duration, yield, and currency that support our reinsurance liabilities. Foreign exchange risks are managed by holding cash and investments in foreign currencies where we have reinsurance liabilities that will be paid in those currencies. We are exposed to nominal equity risk and have a very limited equity portfolio. We perform stress testing of the investment portfolio using stochastic scenarios to evaluate the investment portfolio risk and capital needs.
Investment risk includes liquidity risk, including the risk that the group does not have sufficient liquid funds to pay losses as they become due. The inherent nature of insurance claims is such that unanticipated significant claims activity under our reinsurance policies, outside our historical experience, could potentially impact our liquidity at any time. We mitigate this risk by maintaining a portfolio of highly liquid fixed income securities in our available-for-sale ("AFS") portfolio and by keeping the duration of our assets reasonably close to the duration of our liabilities.
 9

Operational Risk Management
Operational Risk includes the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems and/or external events. Operational risk also includes legal risks. These types of operational failures could negatively impact our reputation with customers, agents and brokers, shareholders, and regulators. The ERM Committee in collaboration with individual business units and risk owners are responsible for the identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting of operational risks. Operational risks are mitigated through strong process controls, training and business continuity planning.
Our Financial Strength Ratings 
A.M. Best has developed a rating system to provide an opinion of an insurer’s or reinsurer’s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders. Each rating reflects that rating agency’s independent opinion of the capitalization, management and sponsorship of the entity to which it relates, and is neither an evaluation directed to investors in our common shares nor a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our common shares. A.M. Best maintains a letter scale rating system ranging from "A++" (Superior) to "F" (In Liquidation). 
 On November 14, 2018, A.M. Best downgraded the financial strength rating to B++ (Good) from A- (Excellent) and the long-term issuer credit rating to “bbb” from “a-”, with negative outlook and implications, of Maiden Bermuda, our primary operating subsidiary. In February 2019, we requested from A.M. Best to withdraw our rating. On February 28, 2019, A.M. Best approved the withdrawal with a final rating as "B++" (Good) with negative outlook and implications. As a result, we presently do not have a financial strength rating from any of the major rating agencies that cover our industry.
These financial strength ratings often are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies. We believe that the primary users of such ratings include brokers, ceding companies and investors. As we re-evaluate our future business strategy, the lack of a financial strength rating from one of the major rating agencies may negatively impact our ability to market and sell our products. It may also require us to use collateral more frequently to secure client relationships.
Competition 
The reinsurance industry is mature and highly competitive. Reinsurance companies compete on the basis of many factors, including premium rates, company and underwriter relationships, general reputation and perceived financial strength, the terms and conditions of the products offered, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payments, reputation and experience in risks underwritten, capacity and coverages offered and various other factors. These factors operate at the individual market participant level and generally in the aggregate across the reinsurance industry. In addition, underlying economic conditions and variations in the reinsurance buying practices of ceding companies, by participant and in the aggregate, contribute to cyclical movements in rates, terms and conditions and may impact industry aggregate results and subsequently the level of competition in the reinsurance industry. 
Maiden Bermuda has competed with a wide variety of major reinsurers internationally including those based in Bermuda. Many of these entities have significantly more capital, higher ratings from rating agencies and more employees than we do; in addition, these entities have established long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry, which can be significant competitive advantages. The lack of a financial strength rating from one of the major rating agencies may be a significant competitive disadvantage for us when we look to write new business or renew existing accounts.
In addition, in recent years, significant increases in the use of risk-linked securities and derivative and other non-traditional risk transfer mechanisms and vehicles are being developed and offered by other parties, including entities other than insurance and reinsurance companies. The availability of both these non-traditional products and sources of capital could reduce the demand for traditional insurance and reinsurance.
Distribution of Our Reinsurance Products 
Until the sale of Maiden US in August 2018, we marketed our Diversified Reinsurance segment through third party intermediaries, as well as directly through our own marketing efforts. Our direct marketing activities were generally focused on insurers with a demonstrated preference and propensity to utilize direct distribution reinsurers. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the sources of gross premiums written in our Diversified Reinsurance segment were as follows: 

% of Gross Premiums Written for the Year Ended December 31, | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Total broker | 33.0 | % | | 16.1 | % | 11.7 | %
Direct | 67.0 | % | | 83.9 | % | 88.3 | %
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

Reserve for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
General 
We are required by applicable insurance laws and regulations in Bermuda, the U.S., Sweden and by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S. GAAP") to establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all loss and LAE incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies and treaties that we write. These reserves are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of loss and LAE which we are ultimately required to pay for insured or reinsured claims that have occurred as of or before the balance sheet date. The loss and LAE reserves on our balance sheet represent management’s best estimate of the outstanding liabilities associated with our premium earned.  In developing this estimate, management considers the results of internal and external actuarial analyses, trends in those analyses as well as industry trends. Our opining independent actuary certifies that the reserves established by management make a reasonable provision for our unpaid loss and LAE obligations.
 10

These amounts include case reserves and provisions for Incurred But Not Reported ("IBNR") reserves. Case reserves are established for losses that have been reported to us, and not yet paid. IBNR reserves represent the estimated cost of losses that have occurred but have not been reported to us and include a provision for additional development on case reserves. We establish case reserves based on information from the ceding company, reinsurance intermediaries, and when appropriate, consultations with independent legal counsel. The IBNR reserves are established by management based on reported loss and LAE and actuarially determined estimates of ultimate loss and LAE. 
A variety of standard actuarial methods are calculated to estimate ultimate loss and LAE. The majority of our business is reserved individually by cedant and line of business, with the remainder reserved in homogeneous groupings. Ultimate loss selections are accumulated across the reserve segments, and appropriate actuarial judgment is applied to determine the final selection of estimated ultimate losses. Ultimate losses are converted to IBNR reserves by subtracting inception to date paid losses and case reserves from those amounts. The combined total of case and IBNR results in indicated reserves which are the basis for the carried reserves for financial statements. Ultimate losses are also used to estimate premium and commission accruals for accounts with adjustable features. 
Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability; rather, loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate resolution and administration of claims will cost. These estimates are based on actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. Loss reserve estimates are refined as experience develops and as claims are reported and resolved. Establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. In addition, the relatively long reporting periods between when a loss occurs and when it may be reported to our claims department for our casualty lines of business also increase the uncertainties of our reserve estimates in such lines. To assist us in establishing appropriate reserves for loss and LAE, we analyze a significant amount of internal data and external insurance industry information with respect to the pricing environment and loss settlement patterns. In combination with our individual account pricing analyses and our internal loss settlement patterns, this industry information is used to guide our loss and LAE estimates. These estimates are reviewed quarterly, at a high level of detail, and any adjustments are reflected in earnings in the periods in which they are determined. 
For additional information concerning our reserves, see Item 7,"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies — Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expense" and "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 9. Reserve for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses" included under Item 8 "Financial Statement and Supplementary Data", for further information regarding the specific actuarial models we utilize and the uncertainties in establishing the reserve for loss and LAE. 
Our Employees
On March 4, 2019, we had approximately 74 full-time employees who are located in Bermuda, the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Ireland, and Australia. We believe that our employee relations are good. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. 
Regulatory Matters
General 
The insurance and reinsurance industry are subject to regulatory and legislative oversight and regulation in various markets we operate in. 
Bermuda Insurance Regulation 
Maiden Bermuda is regulated as a registered Class 3B general business insurer under the Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda, as amended, and related regulations (together, the "Insurance Act"), which regulates the insurance business of Bermuda registered insurers and provides that no person shall carry on any insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless that person has been registered under the Insurance Act by the BMA. The BMA is responsible for the day-to-day supervision of insurers and insurance groups in respect of which it is the group supervisor. Under the Insurance Act, insurance business includes reinsurance business. The registration of an applicant as an insurer is subject to its complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the BMA may impose from time to time. 
The Company and Maiden Bermuda failed to meet the requirements to hold sufficient capital to cover their respective ECR as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018. The Company had communicated such condition to the BMA and is following the guidelines of a reportable “event” as stipulated by Bermuda insurance law. In accordance with the Insurance Act, Maiden Bermuda is not permitted to pay dividends to its shareholders, Maiden Holdings and Maiden NA, as of December 31, 2018 as it is in breach of the requirement to maintain economic capital in excess of the ECR as stipulated in the Insurance Act, Insurance (Prudential Standards) Class 4 and Class 3B Solvency Requirement Rules 2008, and the Insurance (Group Supervision) Rules 2011.
The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards as well as auditing and reporting requirements on Bermuda insurance companies and grants to the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. The Insurance Act also imposes certain regulatory requirements on insurance groups where the BMA has determined that it should act as group supervisor. Certain significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below:

• | Cancellation of Insurer's Registration: An insurer's registration may be canceled by the BMA on certain grounds specified in the Insurance Act, including failure of the insurer to comply with its obligations under the Insurance Act or if, in the opinion of the BMA, the insurer has not been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles. We believe that we are in compliance with applicable regulations under the Insurance Act;

 11


• | Principal Office, Principal Representative and Head Office: An insurer is required to maintain a principal office in Bermuda and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda. It is the duty of the principal representative, upon reaching the view that, to the principal representative’s knowledge, there is a likelihood of the insurer for which the principal representative acts becoming insolvent, or that one or more of certain events as set out in the Insurance Act has occurred or is believed to have occurred, to immediately notify the BMA and to make a report in writing to the BMA within 14 days of the prior notification setting out all the particulars of the case that are available to the principal representative. Further, any registered insurer that is a Class 3A insurer or above is required to maintain a head office in Bermuda and direct and manage its insurance business from Bermuda. In considering whether this requirement is met, the BMA will consider: (a) where the underwriting, risk management and operational decision making occurs; (b) whether the presence of senior executives who are responsible for, and involved in, the decision making are located in Bermuda; and (c) where meetings of the board of directors occur, and may also have regard to (i) the location where management meets to effect policy decisions; (ii) the residence of the officers, insurance managers or employees; and (iii) the residence of one or more directors in Bermuda. For the purpose of the Insurance Act, Maiden Bermuda’s principal office is the Company’s executive offices at Ideation House, 2nd Floor, 94 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke, HM 08, Bermuda;


• | Annual Financial Statements, Annual Statutory Financial Return and Annual Capital and Solvency Return: The Company and Maiden Bermuda must prepare annual statutory financial statements as prescribed in the Insurance Act with respect to its general business. The statutory financial return for a Class 3B insurer includes a report of the approved independent auditor on the statutory financial statements of such insurer, the statutory financial statements for the general business, notes to the statutory financial statements and an insurer information sheet. At the time of filing the statutory financial return, a Class B insurer must also deliver to the BMA a statutory declaration of compliance. Maiden Bermuda is required to file audited U.S. GAAP annual financial statements with the BMA, which must be available to the public. In addition, Maiden Bermuda is required to file a capital and solvency return, which shall include the company's Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement ("BSCR") model, together with the opinion of its loss reserve specialist, a commercial insurer’s solvency self assessment (“CISSA”) and such other schedules as prescribed under the Insurance Act. The BSCR model applies factors to premium, reserves and assets/liabilities to determine the minimum capital required by the BMA to remain solvent throughout the year. The catastrophe risk return assesses an insurer’s reliance on vendor models in assessing catastrophe exposure. The Company is required to file annual group GAAP financial statements, a group statutory financial return, and an annual group capital and solvency return, which includes (among other things) a group catastrophe risk return, group BSCR and GSSA. The GSSA is based on the Company’s own internally assessed capital requirements. The GSSA together with the group BSCR form part of the BMA’s annual solvency assessment; 


• | Minimum Liquidity Ratio: The Insurance Act requires all general business insurers to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of its relevant liabilities. Relevant assets include cash and cash equivalents, quoted investments, unquoted bonds and debentures, first liens on real estate, investment income due and accrued, accounts and premiums receivable, reinsurance balances receivable and funds held by ceding reinsurers. There are certain categories of assets which, unless specifically permitted by the BMA, do not automatically qualify as relevant assets, such as unquoted equity securities, investments in and advances to affiliates and real estate and collateral loans. The relevant liabilities are total general business insurance reserves and total other liabilities less deferred income tax and letters of credit and guarantees and other instruments;


• | Minimum Solvency Margin, Enhanced Capital Requirement and Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions: Under the Insurance Act, Maiden Bermuda must ensure that the value of its general business statutory assets exceeds the amount of its general business statutory liabilities by an amount greater than its prescribed minimum solvency margin ("MSM"). Maiden Bermuda is also required to maintain available statutory economic capital and surplus at least equal to its ECR. Maiden Bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus, as shown in its previous financial year statutory balance sheet, unless at least seven days before payment of the dividends it files with the BMA an affidavit that it will continue to meet its MSM and minimum liquidity ratio as described above. In addition, Maiden Bermuda must obtain the BMA’s prior approval before reducing its total statutory capital, as shown in its previous year’s financial statements, by 15% or more. Maiden Bermuda is not permitted to declare or pay dividends to its shareholders, Maiden Holdings and Maiden NA, if Maiden Bermuda is in breach of its MSM, ECR or minimum liquidity ratio or if the declaration of such dividend would cause such a breach. Where an insurer fails to meet its MSM or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year, it will be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the BMA;


• | Eligible Capital: Class 3B and 4 insurers and insurance groups are required to maintain statutory economic capital and surplus (“Economic Capital”) for determination of regulatory available capital in accordance with a ‘3 tiered capital regime’. All capital instruments are classified as either basic or ancillary capital which in turn are classified into one of three tiers (Tiers 1, 2 and 3) based on their “loss absorbency” characteristics. Under this regime, there are limits of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital which may be used to satisfy the Class 3B and 4 insurers’ and Group’s MSM and ECR requirements. The Company has received approval for certain capital instruments as other fixed capital. The $152.5 million 7.75% notes maturing in 2043 (the "2013 Senior Notes") are approved as Tier-1 ancillary capital and are grandfathered pursuant to Section 6C of the Insurance Act. The $110.0 million 6.625% notes maturing in 2046 (the "2016 Senior Notes") are approved as Tier-3 ancillary capital (please see footnote below for further details). Maiden's Preference Shares Series A and Series C are classified as Tier-1 Basic Capital. Maiden's Preference Shares Series D were approved on November 6, 2017 as Tier-2 Basic Capital. Please see the following table for details of the Company's capital instruments that are currently outstanding at December 31, 2018:

 12


Description of Capital Instrument | Date of Issue | Maturity Date (as applicable) | Date approved by the Authority | Value of Capital Instruments | | Eligible Capital Tier
 | | | | ($ in thousands) | | 
2013 Senior Notes | November 25, 2013 | December 1, 2043 | April 17, 2014 | $ | 152,500 | | | Tier 1
2016 Senior Notes(1) | June 14, 2016 | June 14, 2046 | January 23, 2017 | 110,000 | | | Tier 3
Preference Shares - Series A(2) | August 22, 2012 | Perpetual | April 17, 2014 | 150,000 | | | Tier 1
Preference Shares - Series C(2) | November 25, 2015 | Perpetual | April 17, 2014 | 165,000 | | | Tier 1
Preference Shares - Series D(2) | June 15, 2017 | Perpetual | November 6, 2017 | 150,000 | | | Tier 2

(1) In June 2016, the Company issued the 2016 Senior Notes. The BMA approved the capital instruments as Tier-3 ancillary capital to be grandfathered under Section 21 paragraph 10 of the Group Rules until January 1, 2026 as the 2016 Senior Notes do not meet the requirement that coupon payment on the instrument be cancellable or deferrable indefinitely upon breach (or if it would cause breach) in the ECR. The Group’s ECR shall be subject to a regulatory capital add-on comprising three years of coupon payments on the 2016 Senior Notes amounting to $21.9 million.
(2)All our Preference shares are redeemable in whole or in part at the sole option of the Company any time after 5 years from the date of issuance, subject to certain regulatory restrictions at a redemption price of $25 per preference share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends.

• | Economic Balance Sheet Framework and Financial Condition Report: Effective January 2016, the BMA has implemented an Economic Balance Sheet ("EBS") framework to be used as the basis to determine the ECR of insurers and group that is generally based on fair-value in line with the GAAP principles adopted by the insurer, except for the valuation of insurance technical provisions. Technical provisions shall be valued at an economic value using the best estimate of probability weighted cash flows, with an additional risk margin. Cash flows, for this purpose, shall take into account all future cash in and out flows required to settle the insurance obligations attributable to the remaining lifetime of the policy. The BMA has also implemented new public disclosure rules that require all insurers and insurance groups to prepare and publish a Financial Condition Report ("FCR"). The FCR is intended to provide additional information to the public in relation to the insurer’s and group’s business model, whereby they may make an informed assessment on whether the business is run in a prudent manner;


• | Fit and Proper Controllers: The BMA maintains supervision over the controllers of all registered insurers in Bermuda. A controller includes (i) the managing director of the registered insurer or its parent company; (ii) the chief executive of the registered insurer or of its parent company; (iii) a shareholder controller; and (iv) any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the registered insurer or of its parent company are accustomed to act;


• | Notification by Registered Person of Change of Controllers and Officers: All registered insurers are required to give written notice to the BMA of the fact that a person has become, or ceased to be, a controller or officer of the registered insurer within 45 days of becoming aware of such fact. An officer in relation to a registered insurer means a director, chief executive or senior executive performing duties of underwriting, actuarial, risk management, compliance, internal audit, finance or investment matters;


• | Notification of Material Changes: All registered insurers are required to give 14 days’ notice to the BMA of a proposal to make certain changes that are likely to be of material significance (a “material change” within the meaning of the Insurance Act) and the insurer may not effect such change until either the BMA has, before the end of the period of thirty days beginning with the date of service of such notice, notified the insurer in writing that there is no objection to the insurer effecting the material change, or that period has elapsed without the BMA having served the insurer with a written notice of objection to the material change. Additionally, a Designated Insurer (as defined below) must notify the BMA of certain material changes when given effect by a member of the group, within 30 days of such material change taking effect; 


• | Code of Conduct: Maiden Bermuda is required to comply with the Insurance Code of Conduct of the Authority ("Code") which prescribes the duties and standards which must be complied with to ensure it implements sound corporate governance, risk management and internal controls. The Authority will assess an insurer’s compliance with the Code in a proportional manner relative to the nature, scale and complexity of its business. Failure to comply with the requirements under the Code will be a factor taken into account by the BMA in determining whether an insurer is conducting its business in a sound and prudent manner as prescribed by the Insurance Act. Such failure to comply with the requirements of the Code could result in the BMA exercising its powers of intervention (see BMA's Powers of Intervention, Obtaining Information, Reports and Documents and Providing Information to other Regulatory Authorities below). We believe that we are in compliance with the Code;


• | Group Supervision: The BMA acts as group supervisor of the Company and has designated Maiden Bermuda to be the designated insurer ("Designated Insurer"). As group supervisor, the BMA will perform a number of supervisory functions including (i) coordinating the gathering and dissemination of relevant or essential information for going concerns and emergency situations, including the dissemination of information which is of importance for the supervisory task of other competent authorities; (ii) carrying out a supervisory review and assessment of the financial situation of the insurance group; (iii) carrying out an assessment of the insurance group's compliance with the rules on solvency, risk concentration, intra-group transactions as may be prescribed by or under the Insurance Act; (iv) assessment of the system of governance of insurance groups, as may be prescribed under the Insurance Act, and whether the members of the administrative or management body of participating companies met the requirements set out therein; (v) planning and coordinating, through regular meetings held at least annually (or by other appropriate means) with other competent authorities, supervisory

 13

activities in respect of the insurance group, both as a going concern and in emergency situations; (v) coordinating any enforcement action that may need to be taken against the insurance group or any of its members; and (vi) planning and coordinating meetings of colleges of supervisors in order to facilitate the carrying out of the functions described above. In carrying out its group supervisory functions, the BMA may make rules for (i) assessing the financial situation and the solvency position of the insurance group and/or its members and (ii) regulating intra group transactions, risk concentration, governance procedures, risk management and regulatory reporting and disclosure;

• | Group MSM and Group ECR: The insurance group must ensure that the value of the insurance group's total statutory economic capital and surplus exceeds the aggregate of (a) the MSM of each qualifying member of the group controlled by the parent company and (b) the parent company’s percentage shareholding in the member multiplied by the member’s MSM, where the parent company exercises significant influence over a member of the group but does not control the member ("Group MSM"). A member is a qualifying member of the insurance group if it is subject to solvency requirements in the jurisdiction in which it is registered. Since December 31, 2013, we have been required to maintain available group capital and surplus at a level equal to or in excess of the Group Enhanced Capital Requirement ("Group ECR") which is established by reference to either the Group BSCR model or an approved group internal capital model;


• | Designated Insurer Notification Obligations: The Designated Insurer must immediately notify the BMA upon reaching a view that there is a likelihood of the insurance group or any member of the group becoming insolvent (i.e. breaching a regulatory capital requirement applicable to the insurance group or any member) or if the Designated Insurer knows or has reason to believe that a reportable "event" has, to the Designated Insurer's knowledge, occurred or is believed to have occurred. Within 30 days of such notification to the BMA, the Designated Insurer must furnish the BMA with a written report setting out all the particulars of the case that are available to it and within 45 days, it must furnish a group capital and solvency return that reflects the Group ECR that has been prepared using post-loss data and unaudited financial statements for such period as the BMA shall require together with a declaration of solvency in respect thereof;


• | Group Eligible Capital: To enable the BMA to better assess the quality of the group’s capital resources, the Designated Insurer is required to disclose the makeup of its group’s capital in accordance with a ‘3-tiered capital system’. Under this system, all of the insurance group’s capital instruments will be classified as either basic or ancillary capital which in turn will be classified into one of 3 tiers based on their “loss absorbency” characteristics. Highest quality capital will be classified as Tier 1 Capital, and lesser quality capital will be classified as either Tier 2 Capital or Tier 3 Capital. Under this regime, not more than certain specified percentages of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital may be used to satisfy the Group’s MSM and Group ECR requirements. Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital may, until January 1 2026, include capital instruments that do not satisfy the requirement that the instrument be non-redeemable or settled only with the issuance of an instrument of equal or higher quality upon a breach, or if redemption would cause a breach, of the Group ECR. 


• | Quarterly Group Financial Returns: A Designated Insurer is required to prepare and file quarterly group financial returns with the BMA on or before the last day of the months May, August and November of each year. The quarterly group financial returns consist of (i) quarterly unaudited (consolidated) group financial statements for each financial quarter (which must minimally include a balance sheet and income statement and must also be the most recent produced by the group and not reflect a financial position that exceeds two months) and (ii) a list and details of material intra-group transactions and risk concentrations (including, where applicable, exposure value (face value and market value, if the latter is available), counterparties involved (including their location), summary details of the purpose, terms, costs, duration and performance triggers relating to the transaction), details surrounding all intra-group reinsurance and retrocession arrangements (including aggregated values of the exposure limits by counterparties, aggregated premium flows and the proportion of the group’s insurance business exposure covered by internal reinsurance, retrocession and other risk transfer arrangements) and details of the ten largest exposures to unaffiliated counterparties and any other unaffiliated counterparty exposures (or series of linked unaffiliated counterparty exposures) exceeding 10% of the insurance group's statutory capital and surplus;


• | BMA's Powers of Intervention, Obtaining Information, Reports and Documents and Providing Information to other Regulatory Authorities: The BMA has certain powers of investigation and intervention relating to insurers and their holding companies, subsidiaries and other affiliates, which it may exercise in the interest of such insurer's policyholders or if there is any risk of insolvency or of a breach of the Insurance Act or the insurer's license conditions; and


• | Economic Substance Act: The Economic Substance Act 2018 (“EAS 2018”) came into effect in Bermuda in December 2018 and impacts every Bermuda registered entity engaged in a “relevant activity” which includes insurance and headquarters. The EAS 2018 requires impacted entities to maintain a substantial economic presence in Bermuda and to satisfy economic substance requirements. Any entity that must satisfy economic substance requirements but fails to do so could face automatic disclosure to competent authorities in the EU of the information filed by the entity with the Bermuda Registrar of Companies in connection with the economic substance requirements. Additionally a company may also face penalties, restriction or regulation of its business activities and may be struck off as a registered entity in Bermuda for failure to satisfy economic substance requirements. 

The BMA’s prudential framework for (re)insurance and group supervision has been recognized by the European Commission’s Delegated Act and adopted by the European Parliament as being fully equivalent to regulatory standards applied to European reinsurance companies and insurance groups in accordance with the requirements of the Solvency II directive, effective January 1, 2016. Under the Solvency II directive, the European Commission may determine whether the solvency regime of a third country is equivalent to that laid down in Solvency II in relation to three areas of focus. Articles 172 relates to equivalence of the solvency regime applied to the reinsurance activities of (re)insurers with their head office in the third country concerned, which allows reinsurance contracts with (re)insurers in that third country to be treated in the same way as reinsurance contracts with EEA (re)insurers. Article 227 relates to third-country insurers which are part of EEA groups, where equivalence would allow groups to take into account the local calculation of capital requirements and available capital rather than calculation on a Solvency II basis for the purposes of the deduction and aggregation method. Article 260 relates to group supervision of EEA insurers with parents 
 14

outside the EEA, where equivalence would mean EEA supervisors would rely on the group supervision of that third country. Bermuda received equivalence in all three areas: Articles 172, 227 and 260, with the exception of rules on captives and special purpose insurers, which are subject to different regulatory regime in Bermuda.
Certain Bermuda Law Considerations 
Maiden Holdings and Maiden Bermuda have been designated as non-resident for exchange control purposes by the BMA and are required to obtain the permission of the BMA for the issue and transfer of all of their shares. The BMA has given its consent for: (a) the issue and transfer of Maiden Holdings' common shares, up to the amount of its authorized capital from time to time, to and among persons that are non-residents of Bermuda for exchange control purposes; and (b) the issue and transfer of up to 20% of Maiden Holdings' common shares in issue from time to time to and among persons resident in Bermuda for exchange control purposes.
Transfers and issues of Maiden Holdings' common shares to any resident in Bermuda for exchange control purposes may require specific prior approval under the Exchange Control Act 1972. Maiden Bermuda's common shares cannot be issued or transferred without the consent of the BMA. Because we are designated as non-resident for Bermuda exchange control purposes, we are allowed to engage in transactions, and to pay dividends to Bermuda non-residents who are holders of our common shares, in currencies other than the Bermuda Dollar. 
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015
Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 ("TRIA"), which was previously amended and extended in 2005, 2007 and again in 2015 by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 ("TRIPRA"), was enacted to ensure the availability of insurance coverage for terrorist acts in the U.S. This law renewed the prior federal terrorism risk insurance program. It was extended through December 31, 2020 with certain modifications in the provisions of the expiring program. 
There is no assurance that TRIA will be extended beyond 2020 on either a temporary or permanent basis and its expiration (or renewal on a substantially modified basis) could have an adverse effect on our clients, the industry or us. TRIA does not apply to reinsurers directly but does apply directly to insurers and to excess and surplus lines insurers. The TRIPRA has had some impact on our reinsurance clients, but not all due to the lines of business covered by TRIA. Also, in general, our reinsurance contracts contain inuring language regarding any potential recoveries from TRIA. Additional material addressing TRIA and TRIPRA, including U.S. Treasury Department issued interpretive letters, are contained on the U.S. Treasury Department’s website.
Taxation of the Company and its Subsidiaries 
The following summary of certain taxation matters is based upon current law. Legislative, judicial or administrative changes may be forthcoming that could affect this summary. Certain subsidiaries are subject to taxation related to operations in Australia, Germany, Sweden, the U.K. and the U.S. The discussion below covers the principal locations in which the Company or its subsidiaries are subject to taxation. 
Bermuda 
Maiden Holdings and Maiden Bermuda each have received from the Minister of Finance an assurance under The Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act, 1966 to the effect that in the event that there is any legislation enacted in Bermuda imposing tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of any such tax shall not be applicable to Maiden Holdings or Maiden Bermuda or to any of their operations or the shares, debentures or other obligations of Maiden Holdings or Maiden Bermuda until March 31, 2035. These assurances are subject to the proviso that they are not construed to prevent the application of any tax or duty to such persons as are ordinarily resident in Bermuda (Maiden Holdings and Maiden Bermuda are not currently so designated) or to prevent the application of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of The Land Tax Act, 1967 of Bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to the property leased to us. 
Germany 
AVS was a wholly owned subsidiary of Maiden Global until January 10, 2019. AVS is subject to German corporate income tax of 15.0% plus a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% thereon (in the aggregate, a rate of 15.825%). In addition, a German municipal trade tax of 14.7% resulting from the registered seat of the company in Russelsheim is paid. Effective January 1, 2017, Opel Händler VersicherungsService GmbH, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of AVS, merged with AVS. AVS is engaged in general commerce. 
The taxable income of a German corporate entity is in principle, absent a Treaty exemption, the total amount of worldwide income (current profits, capital gains) after deduction of business expenses. In general, income from capital gains arising upon the sale of shares in corporate entities are, in principle, fully tax exempt. The same applies to income from dividend if the stake in the dividend paying corporation is at least 10% (for corporate income tax purposes), 15% (for trade tax purposes) at the beginning of the respective calendar year (for dividends received from companies resident outside Germany, the 15% stake in the non-resident corporation must be held as from the beginning of the calendar year). However, a lump sum of 5% of the dividend/capital gains is added back to the taxable income, representing non-deductible business expenses. 
Maiden Global established a German branch on February 1, 2016, also with its registered seat in Russelsheim which is subject to the same German corporate income tax of 15.0% plus a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% thereon (in the aggregate, a rate of 15.825%) and German trade tax of 14.7%. Effective December 1, 2018, the registered seat was moved to Wiesbaden resulting in a change in the trade tax rate to 15.89%. The German branch is engaged in general commerce.
AVS established a 50:50 joint venture with Volvo Car Germany GmbH on January 25, 2016, named VCIS Germany GmbH (“VCIS”). With its registered seat in Cologne, the company is subject to the same German corporate income tax of 15.0% plus a 
 15

solidarity surcharge of 5.5% thereon (in the aggregate, a rate of 15.825%) and a German trade tax of 16.63%. VCIS is engaged in general commerce as an insurance agency. 
Maiden Global has obtained a withholding tax exemption certificate from the Federal Central Tax Office such that any dividend from AVS to Maiden Global is exempt from German withholding tax. There is no German withholding tax on (non-profit related) interest payments to corporate shareholders. Other than through the entities noted above, we believe that the Company has operated and will continue to operate its business in a manner that will not cause its affiliates to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within Germany. A trade or business in Germany requires a permanent establishment either in the form of a fixed place of business or by having a permanent representative on German ground. A subsidiary may qualify as permanent representative if it carries out business activities of its shareholder or an affiliate in Germany.
Sweden 
Maiden LF and Maiden GF are subject to Swedish taxation on net profits irrespective of whether the profits are generated through business in general or capital. To the extent that net profits are generated, profits are taxed at a rate of 22%. Foreign entities are subject to tax in Sweden only to the extent they have a permanent establishment in Sweden or if the income is related to certain types of assets, typically real estate, or partnership income. Dividends paid to foreign shareholders may be subject to withholding tax with a maximum of 30% although in many cases tax is reduced as a result of a tax treaty or under domestic legislation. A foreign entity is deemed to have a permanent establishment in Sweden under the rules very similar to those applied by The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD"). Other than Maiden LF and Maiden GF, we believe that the Company has operated and will continue to operate its business in a manner that will not cause it to be treated as having a permanent establishment in Sweden. There is no withholding tax on interest paid by a Swedish borrower to a foreign lender.
United Kingdom 
Maiden Global is tax resident in the U.K. and is currently subject to corporation tax in the U.K. on its trading and other taxable profits. The main rate of U.K. corporation tax is 19% to be reduced to 17% with effect from April 1, 2020. Non-U.K. resident corporations are within the charge to corporation tax in the U.K. if they carry on a trade in the U.K. through a permanent establishment. Reinsurance business developed by Maiden Global is underwritten by Maiden Bermuda in Bermuda. Other than in respect of Maiden Global, we believe that the Company has operated and will continue to operate its business in a manner that will not cause it to be treated as carrying on a trade within the U.K. 
U.K. source income of non-U.K. resident corporations may be subject to U.K. withholding tax, subject to the availability of treaty relief or any other applicable exemptions. Dividends paid by Maiden Global are not subject to U.K. withholding tax. Interest paid by Maiden Global may be subject to U.K. withholding tax at a rate of up to 20%, subject to the availability of treaty relief or any other applicable exemptions. 
United States
Recent tax reform commonly referred to as The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Act") was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Act lowered the corporate U.S. tax rate to 21%, eliminated the alternative minimum tax, limited the deductibility of interest expense and requires a one-time tax on a deemed repatriation of untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In the context of the taxation of U.S. property/casualty insurance companies such as the Company, the 2017 Act also modified the loss reserve discounting rules and the proration rules that apply to reduce reserve deductions to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate. In addition, the 2017 Act included certain provisions intended to eliminate certain perceived tax advantages of companies (including insurance companies) that have legal domiciles outside the United States but have certain U.S. connections and U.S. persons investing in such companies.  For example, the 2017 Act includes a base erosion anti-avoidance tax (the "BEAT") that could make affiliate reinsurance between United States and non-U.S. members of our group economically unfeasible. As discussed in more detail below, the 2017 Act also revised the rules applicable to passive foreign investment companies ("PFICs") and controlled foreign corporations ("CFCs"). Although we are currently unable to predict the ultimate impact of the 2017 Act on our business, shareholders and results of operations, it is possible that the 2017 Act may increase the U.S. federal income tax liability of U.S. members of our group that cede risk to non-U.S. group members and may affect the timing and amount of U.S. federal income taxes imposed on certain U.S. shareholders.  Further, it is possible that other legislation could be introduced and enacted by the current Congress or future Congresses that could have an adverse impact on us. Additionally, tax laws and interpretations regarding whether a company is engaged in a U.S. trade or business or whether a company is a CFC or a PFIC or has related person insurance income ("RPII") are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. There are currently only recently proposed regulations regarding the application of the PFIC rules to an insurance company. Further, the regulations regarding RPII have been in proposed form since 1991. New regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying such rules may be forthcoming. The Company cannot be certain if, when or in what form such regulations or pronouncements may be provided and whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect.
Maiden NA and its subsidiaries, including Maiden US until its sale on December 27, 2018 (collectively, the "Maiden NA Companies"), transact business in and are subject to taxation in the U.S. Other than the Maiden NA Companies, we believe that we have operated and will continue to operate our business in a manner that will not cause us to be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the U.S. On this basis, other than the Maiden NA Companies, we do not expect to be required to pay U.S. corporate income taxes (other than withholding and excise taxes as described below). The maximum federal corporate income tax rate has been reduced by the 2017 Act to 21% for a foreign corporation’s income that is effectively connected with a trade or business in the U.S. In addition, U.S. branches of foreign corporations may be subject to the branch profits tax, which imposes a tax on U.S. branch after-tax earnings that are deemed repatriated out of the U.S., for a potential maximum effective federal tax rate of approximately 44% on the net income connected with a U.S. trade or business.
Foreign corporations not engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. are subject to U.S. income tax, effected through withholding by the payer, on certain fixed or determinable annual or periodic gains, profits and income derived from sources within the U.S. as enumerated in Section 881(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, such as dividends and interest on certain investments.
 16

The U.S. also imposes an excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premiums paid to foreign insurers or reinsurers with respect to risks of a U.S. person located wholly or partly within the U.S. or risks of a foreign person engaged in the conduct of a U.S. trade or business located in the U.S. The rate of tax applicable to reinsurance premiums paid to Maiden Bermuda is 1% of gross premiums.
