 Overview
Tango Therapeutics was founded with a clear mission: discover the next generation of precision medicines to help patients with cancer through addressing the specific genetic alterations that fuel the cancer. We leverage our state-of-the-art target discovery platform to identify novel targets and develop new drugs directed at tumor suppressor gene loss in defined patient populations with high unmet medical need. Tumor suppressor gene loss remains a largely unaddressed target space specifically because these genetic events cannot be directly targeted. Our novel small molecules are designed to be selectively active in cancer cells with specific tumor suppressor gene loss, killing those cancer cells while sparing normal cells. We also are extending this target space beyond the classic, cell-autonomous effects of tumor suppressor gene loss to include the discovery of novel targets that reverse the effects of tumor suppressor gene loss that prevent the immune system from recognizing and killing cancer cells (immune evasion). We believe our approach will provide the ability to deliver the deep, sustained target inhibition necessary to optimize tumor response and clinical benefit as a result of the unique ability of synthetic lethal targeting to spare normal cells.
 Our lead program, TNG908, is an MTA-cooperative inhibitor of PRMT5 designed to work selectively in cancer cells with an MTAP deletion. MTAP-deletion occurs in approximately 10% to 15% of all human tumors including NSCLC, mesothelioma, pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and GBM. In preclinical studies, TNG908 demonstrated 15-fold greater potency in MTAP-deleted cancer cells versus normal cells and robust efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Patients are actively being enrolled in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial and we expect to provide an update on the ongoing dose escalation portion of the trial, focusing on proof-of-mechanism, in the second quarter of 2023.
 Given the large number of patients with MTAP-deleted cancers who may benefit from a PRMT5 inhibitor, and the resulting business opportunity, we also developed a next-generation PRMT5 inhibitor, TNG462, with increased potency, MTAP-deletion selectivity, as well as longer target coverage. TNG462 is 45 times more potent in cells with an MTAP deletion than those without and induces deep tumor regressions in preclinical models of multiple cancer types which is expected to significantly increase the therapeutic index. The clinical development path for TNG462 is expected to be similar to TNG908, evaluating safety and efficacy in multiple tumor types in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. GBM will be excluded from the clinical trial as TNG462 is not expected to cross the blood-brain barrier. We expect to initiate the Phase 1/2 clinical trial for TNG462 in mid-2023.
 Discovered as part of our immune evasion target discovery platform, TNG260 is a first-in-class, CoREST inhibitor, which has shown to reverse the immune evasion effect of STK11 loss-of-function mutations. STK11 loss-of-function mutations are present in approximately 15% of NSCLC, 15% of cervical, 10% of carcinoma of unknown primary, 5% of breast and 3% of pancreatic cancers. In syngeneic models with an STK11 mutation and an intact immune system, the combination of TNG260 with an anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in sustained complete tumor regressions and the induction of immune memory against re-implantation of tumors. We plan to file an IND for TNG260 in the first half of 2023. We expect that TNG260 will be among the first oncology molecules to leverage the benefits of genetically-based patient selection (STK11-mutation) with checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
 We are developing TNG348, a novel allosteric inhibitor of USP1 for treatment of BRCA1 and BRCA2-mutant and other HRD+ cancers. BRCA1 or BRCA 2 mutations are present in approximately 15% of ovarian cancers, 10% of breast cancers, 10% of prostate cancers, 5% of endometrial cancers and 5% of pancreatic cancers and additionally, BRCA wild-type HRD+ mutations are present in approximately 40% of ovarian, 15% of breast, 3% of prostate and 2% of pancreatic cancers. In vivo preclinical studies for TNG348 have shown single agent efficacy and combination benefit with PARP inhibitors in BRCA1, BRCA2-mutant and other HRD+ cell-line and patient derived xenografts, including those that are intrinsically resistant to PARP inhibition. These preclinical data further demonstrate that TNG348 is synergistic with PARP inhibition across a panel of human ovarian and breast cancer cell lines, including both PARP inhibitor sensitive and resistant models. Clinically, we expect TNG348 to have single agent activity in PARP inhibitor -naïve and PARP inhibitor-resistant BRCA1/2 mutant and other HRD+ cancers, and to synergize with PARP inhibitors. We expect to file an IND for this program in mid-2023.
 In October 2018, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Gilead (Gilead Agreement), which was expanded in August 2020. Our immune evasion platform is the foundation for this collaboration. Under the Gilead Agreement, we work together to identify and develop novel immune evasion targets by leveraging our proprietary functional genomics-based

discovery platform. To date, Gilead has licensed two programs and has extended their option on two programs. Our collaboration with Gilead excludes PRMT5, CoREST and USP1 programs as well as a growing pipeline of novel targets identified in our non-immune based target discovery screens. We retain the right to identify and validate targets outside the scope of our collaboration with Gilead, which includes all cell autonomous targets except those discovered in immune evasion contexts, and to develop and commercialize products directed to such targets on our own or in collaboration with third parties. See “— Collaboration and License Agreements — Collaboration and License Agreement with Gilead Sciences” for additional information.
 Our Pipeline
We are leveraging the power and productivity of our discovery engine to discover and validate multiple novel targets each year. Our growing pipeline consists of discovery programs for multiple cancer types with limited treatment options as summarized in Figure 1.

BACKGROUND
Unmet need of cancers caused by tumor suppressor gene loss
 Many genetic drivers of cancer have been well-characterized but have not been directly targeted due to their molecular structure (undruggable oncogenes) or functional loss (tumor suppressor genes). Tumor suppressor gene loss represents a significant portion of the many genetic alterations that drive the formation of cancers but it remains a largely unaddressed target space. Targeting tumor suppressor gene loss directly is not possible because they are deleted or inactivated, and the immune evasion effects of tumor suppressor gene loss has only recently been described. We are using the concept of synthetic lethality to address the unmet medical need of these large groups of patients characterized by tumor suppressor gene loss and activation of immune evasion genes.
 Synthetic lethality to address tumor suppressor gene loss
 Synthetic lethal therapies for cancer refers to pairs of genes where one is inactivated by a genetic alteration and the other is inhibited pharmacologically. While genetic alterations give rise to the development of cancer, they also create a unique vulnerability that can be exploited therapeutically. Biologically, such vulnerability can be the inability of cancer cells to respond to a specific signal, such as DNA damage or cell cycle arrest, or the inability to remodel chromatin or to maintain cellular homeostasis. The unique advantage of a synthetic lethal approach to cancer therapy is that normal cells are not vulnerable to the synthetic lethal drug target and are largely unaffected at drug doses where the mutant cancer cells are selectively killed, noted in Figure 2 below. The recent success of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutant breast, ovarian and prostate cancers is the first clinical example of using synthetic lethality to target tumor suppressor gene loss.
 Figure 2. In cancer cells, when a tumor suppressor gene is lost, it creates a genetic vulnerability that allows an inhibitor to target a synthetic lethal partner gene causing cell death. This selective killing only occurs in cancer cells with tumor suppressor loss, therefore largely sparing the normal cells. Therefore, these synthetic lethality targets inherently can offer a wide therapeutic index.


Moreover, we plan to use the tumor suppressor gene loss as a patient selection marker for clinical trial enrollment to ensure we are enrolling the patients most likely to benefit from each new drug candidate. We believe this approach should enable efficient clinical development and increase the probability of success with maximum clinical benefit for the patient.
Our immune evasion platform
 Our synthetic lethal target discovery approach can be adapted to identify druggable targets that do not kill cancer cells directly, but rather attract immune cells to destroy them. Our immune evasion target discovery platform was designed to incorporate immuno-oncology therapies with genetically-defined patient populations to maximize clinical benefit. We are addressing the unmet medical need of this large group of patients by identifying novel immune evasion genes that (i) are activated by tumor suppressor gene loss and (ii) the effects of which can be reversed through inhibition with a small molecule. In the first step, we perform an in vivo CRISPR-based screen using immune cell-mediated cell killing as the readout. This first step allows us to identify tumor suppressor genes linked to immune evasion. For the second step, we repeat

the in vivo CRISPR screen in animals with an intact immune system looking for potential drug targets that reverse the immune evasion effects of the tumor suppressor gene deletion.
OUR PROGRAMS
PRMT5 inhibitors
Overview
We are currently developing TNG908 and TNG462, potent and selective oral small molecule MTA-cooperative inhibitors of PRMT5, which are designed to be synthetic lethal with MTAP deletion. Current preclinical data suggest the PRMT5-MTAP synthetic lethal interaction is one of the strongest and most prevalent synthetic lethal interactions in human cancers and represents a subset of synthetic lethality termed collateral lethality. This synthetic lethal interaction occurs when MTAP is co-deleted as a “passenger” with the frequently deleted tumor suppressor gene, CDKN2A (p16). The synthetic lethality occurs because MTAP-deleted cells accumulate the PRMT5 inhibitory factor MTA. As a result, PRMT5 is partially inhibited in MTAP-deleted cells, making those cells more sensitive than normal cells to further inhibition of PRMT5 activity.
Taking advantage of this unique interaction between PRMT5 inhibition and MTAP deletion requires that the inhibitors have a specific binding mechanism called MTA cooperativity. TNG908 and TNG462 bind cooperatively with MTA to inhibit PRMT5 function by blocking access to the PRMT5 active site for both protein substrates and the activating PRMT5 co-factor SAM. This MTA-cooperative binding mechanism allows selective inhibition of PRMT5 in tumor cells that have lost MTAP (MTAP-null) while being relatively inert in normal cells without MTAP deletion (MTAP WT). We believe TNG908 and TNG462 are differentiated from non-MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors as a result of this mechanism of action. This approach is expected to result in a large therapeutic window in patients with MTAP-deleted tumors, potentially limiting toxicity and leading to meaningful clinical responses.
We are developing TNG908 for the treatment of patients with solid tumors with homozygous MTAP deletion (10- 15% of all human tumors) including NSCLC, mesothelioma, pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and GBM. In preclinical studies, TNG908 has 15-fold greater selectivity for MTAP-null cancer cells over MTAP WT cells, strong anti-tumor effects in vivo, and pharmacokinetics that support its potential to be a leading PRMT5 inhibitor if approved. The FDA granted TNG908 Fast Track designation to TNG908 and additionally, the granted Orphan Drug Designations to TNG908 for the treatment of MPNST and malignant glioma, including GBM. We are actively dosing patients in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial and we expect to provide an update on the ongoing dose escalation portion of the trial, focusing on proof-of-mechanism, in the second quarter of 2023.
 We also are developing TNG462, a more potent and selective PRMT5 inhibitor with improved pharmacokinetic properties as compared to TNG908. We believe additional potency may allow stronger target inhibition and thus clinical efficacy, and additional selectivity for MTAP-deleted cells may provide a wider therapeutic index. In the first quarter of 2023, the FDA cleared the IND for the Phase 1/2 trial and granted Fast Track designation to TNG462. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in mid-2023. The trial, which will require all patients to have a homozygous MTAP deletion, will evaluate cancers including NSCLC, mesothelioma and cholangiocarcinoma. Unlike TNG908, GBM will be excluded from the clinical trial as TNG462 is not expected to cross the blood-brain barrier.
 By advancing both TNG908 and TNG462 into the clinic, we not only maximize the opportunity to help patients with MTAP-deleted cancers but also increase our strategic optionality to develop and potentially commercialize a PRMT5 inhibitor. We look forward to emerging data from these trials to optimize our development and commercialization plans for these programs.
MTAP-deletion frequency in multiple solid tumor types
A partial deletion of chromosome 9p21, driven by loss of the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A, is the most common homozygous deletion in human cancer. MTAP is adjacent to CDKN2A and is lost along with it in 80-90% of CDKN2A-deleted tumors, thus MTAP is one of the most commonly deleted genes across all cancer types. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and data from a 2014 publication by Lee et al, there are at least 15 cancer types where MTAP loss occurs in more than 10% of patients, including approximately 10% of non-squamous NSCLC, 20% of squamous NSCLC, 25% of bladder cancers, 30% to 55% of MPNST and 40% of GBM. Given that we believe this is a large and important opportunity for patients with cancer, we are developing both TNG908 and TNG462.
 Figure 3. The frequency of MTAP deletion across tumor types as determined from analysis of TCGA and an indication specific publication



PRMT5 mechanism of action
 PRMT5 has long been a therapeutic target of interest for cancer given its role in regulating proteins involved in multiple essential cellular functions, including RNA splicing, cell cycling, cell death, and metabolic signaling. PRMT5 is a protein arginine methyltransferase that modifies the activity of these proteins, which are critical for growth and viability of both normal and cancer cells.
PRMT5 methylates target proteins by removing a methyl group from SAM, the co-factor and methyl donor which is necessary for PRMT5 activity, and transferring that methyl group to a specific residue on target proteins. This methyl modification, or “mark,” alters the function of the target protein, thereby regulating the cell processes for which the protein is important.
The function of PRMT5 is regulated in several ways, including by the endogenous inhibitor MTA. MTA directly competes with SAM for binding to the PRMT5 active site but does not have a methyl donor. Thus, when present, MTA inhibits PRMT5 function.
MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibition as a novel synthetic lethal mechanism in cancers with MTAP-deletion
 Our differentiated approach with TNG908 and TNG462
 The challenge for PRMT5 inhibitors that are not MTA-cooperative is that they kill rapidly growing normal cells (bone marrow cells in particular) as effectively as cancer cells and therefore the level of inhibition needed to kill cancer cells is reduced by on-target, dose-limiting bone marrow toxicity. To address this problem, we designed TNG908 and TNG462 to be selectively active (synthetic lethal) in cancer cells that have a homozygous deletion of MTAP, which is not deleted in normal cells.
TNG908 and TNG462 bind PRMT5 cooperatively with MTA, whereas the non-MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors previously evaluated in clinical trials are either SAM-cooperative or SAM-competitive. In normal cells (MTAP WT), MTA is rapidly degraded by MTAP. When MTAP is deleted in cancer cells, intracellular MTA is markedly elevated compared to normal cells (Figures 4 and 5 below). TNG908 and TNG462 preferentially bind PRMT5 in the presence of MTA and “lock” the enzyme into the inactive state which prevents PRMT5 from methylating target proteins critical for cell survival. As a

result, TNG908 and TNG462 selectively kill MTAP-deleted tumor cells with elevated MTA levels while sparing normal cells.
Figure 4. Schematic of PRMT5 and MTAP functions

   PRMT5 is an essential enzyme for all cell types, and MTAP deletion in cancer cells results in tumor specific sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibition. MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, such as TNG908 and TNG462, may provide a wide therapeutic index by preferentially inhibiting PRMT5 in MTAP-deleted cancer cells, while relatively sparing normal tissue.
Figure 5. TNG908 and TNG462 have an MTA-cooperative mechanism of action that is selective for MTAP-deleted cancer cells

We compared the potency and selectivity of TNG908 and TNG462 to a non-MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor, GSK3326595, in a panel of 180 cancer cell lines representing multiple histologies, including NSCLC, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, mesothelioma, cancers of the central nervous system, leukemia and lymphoma. TNG908 and TNG462 demonstrated significant MTAP-selective inhibition of viability, while GSK3326595 showed no selectivity for MTAP-null cell lines over MTAP WT (Figure 6).
 Figure 6. TNG462 and TNG908 demonstrate strong MTAP selectivity in 180 cancer cell lines as compared to GSK3326595



PRMT5 catalyzes SDMA residues of substrate proteins, a modification that can be detected and quantified by SDMA-specific antibodies as a direct measurement of PRMT5 activity. Therefore, SDMA quantification can be used as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for PRMT5 inhibitors. TNG908 and TNG462 both inhibit PRMT5 90-100% in the MTAP-null HAP1 cell line with marked selectivity over the MTAP WT cell line (Figure 7). The degree of PRMT5 inhibition and selective viability are consistent with data generated in isogenic xenograft models that differ only by presence or absence of the MTAP gene (Figure 8).
Figure 7. PRMT5 inhibition by TNG908 and TNG462 is dose-dependent and MTAP-selective.

PRMT5 preclinical data overview
TNG908 and TNG462 are both highly selective for PRMT5 against a panel of 38 methyltransferases at 10 µM, showing they do not inhibit any other methyltransferases, even well above the predicted clinical efficacious exposure range. Both TNG908 and TNG462 have excellent drug-like properties and are formulated for oral administration. Dose-dependent PRMT5 inhibition and anti-tumor efficacy have been shown in MTAP-null xenograft models, which demonstrate that both molecules suppress tumor growth in an on-target manner.
TNG908 and TNG462 drive dose-dependent, on-target, anti-tumor activity including deep and durable regressions in MTAP-null xenograft models regardless of histology. TNG462 has demonstrated increased potency and MTAP-deletion selectivity as compared to TNG908. Additionally, due to improved pharmacokinetic properties, TNG462 will be dosed once daily in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial.
TNG908 preclinical data summary
In our preclinical studies, TNG908 demonstrated 15-fold greater potency in MTAP-deleted cancer cells versus normal cells and robust efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with these findings, TNG908 demonstrated significant and dose-dependent anti-tumor activity in over 50 xenograft models representing multiple tumor lineages (sample data shown in Figure 9) that did not have a bias to specific histologies. These histology-agnostic responses included strong and durable regressions in a number of models including PDX models of cholangiocarcinoma, NSCLC, bladder cancer and GBM. Notably, in both the NSCLC (squamous) and GBM PDX models shown in Figure 9, complete responses were observed while on TNG908-treatment and maintained when therapy was discontinued in all mice (NSCLC-squamous PDX) and in 4/5 mice (GBM PDX).
 Figure 9. TNG908 demonstrates strong anti-tumor activity with regressions in MTAP-deleted xenograft models
 


In preclinical non-human primate studies, TNG908 has exposure in CSF that is equivalent to plasma when corrected for protein-binding. In addition to the strong anti-tumor activity demonstrated in subcutaneous MTAP-null GBM xenograft models, we also have shown strong efficacy and prolonged survival in a GBM xenograft model that was inoculated in the brain. We believe these data uniquely position TNG908 as a potential treatment option for patients with MTAP-deleted tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), including GBM and CNS metastases of MTAP-deleted solid tumors.
TNG462 preclinical data summary
TNG462 has the same mechanism of action as TNG908 with improved potency and selectivity in MTAP-deleted cancer cell lines. In preclinical studies, TNG462 is 45 times more selective for MTAP-deleted cells (3-fold greater than TNG908) and 28 times more potent than TNG908, which may translate to a wider therapeutic index and stronger target inhibition than TNG908. TNG462 has improved pharmacokinetic properties relative to TNG908 that support once daily dosing in the clinic. Similar to TNG908, TNG462 drives strong anti-tumor activity without bias towards any specific histology. Deep and durable regressions were demonstrated in PDX models derived from cholangiocarcinoma, mesothelioma, lung, bladder and pancreatic cancer (sample data shown in Figure 10). In the preclinical models, TNG462 treatment also suppresses tumor growth even after removal of therapy in a NSCLC (squamous) PDX model.
 Figure 10. TNG462 demonstrates strong anti-tumor activity with regressions in MTAP-deleted xenograft models




Preclinical combination data
 While we expect TNG908 and TNG462 both will show strong single-agent efficacy, we plan to evaluate these molecules clinically in combination with other agents in the future. Based on strong preclinical data showing significant in vivo combination benefit, combinations of potential interest include CDK4/6, MAT2A, and KRAS inhibitors and potentially other oncogene-targeted therapies.
•Essentially all MTAP-deleted tumors also have a CDKN2A deletion and CDKN2A deletion may sensitize cancers to CDK4/6 inhibition, thus combining TNG462 or TNG908 with a CDK4/6 inhibitor may further enhance the clinical benefit of either inhibitor alone. We have demonstrated the efficacy of this combination in preclinical in vivo studies. 
 •MAT2A inhibitors reduce intracellular levels of the activating PRMT5 co-factor, SAM, and increase the ratio of MTA to SAM in MTAP-deleted cells. Strong synergy has been demonstrated preclinically with both TNG908 and TNG462 with a MAT2A inhibitor, suggesting that this could be a beneficial clinical combination in MTAP-deleted tumors. 
 •Approximately 30% of MTAP-deleted lung adenocarcinomas and 85% of MTAP-deleted pancreatic adenocarcinomas are also KRAS-mutant, therefore combining TNG908 or TNG462 with a KRAS inhibitor in these patients may have clinical benefit. Preclinical in vivo studies further support testing these combinations in clinical trials.
 Planned clinical trials
TNG908 Phase 1/2
The Phase 1/2 first-in-human trial is evaluating the oral administration of TNG908 monotherapy in patients with MTAP-deleted tumors (See Figure 11 below). As TNG908 is designed to selectively inhibit PRMT5 in cancers with MTAP deletion, we are limiting enrollment to patients with MTAP-deleted cancers.
 We are actively enrolling patients in the dose escalation phase and evaluating safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and efficacy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors of any histology with an MTAP deletion. Following determination of the optimal efficacious dose, we will evaluate the efficacy of TNG908 in multiple histology-specific expansion arms including MPNST, NSCLC, mesothelioma, cholangiocarcinoma and GBM. In parallel, we will enroll a histology-agnostic cohort to provide optionality for a registration strategy in all tumors regardless of histology if broad activity is observed. Given that MTAP deletion is common in multiple indications, we may expand into additional histology-specific cohorts based on activity observed in the Phase 1/2 trial.

The indication specific cohorts were selected based on the unmet medical need for new therapies in prevalent histologies, including NSCLC, mesothelioma, cholangiocarcinoma and GBM, as well as indications where there are limited treatment options with no standard of care such as MPNST.
In the first quarter of 2022, the FDA cleared the IND for the Phase 1/2 trial and granted Fast Track designation to TNG908. We are actively enrolling patients in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of TNG908. Based on a recent protocol amendment, GBM patients will be added to the ongoing trial. We expect to provide an update on the ongoing dose escalation portion of the trial, focusing on the proof-of-mechanism, in the second quarter of 2023.

Figure 11. TNG908 First-in-human trial schema.


TNG462 Phase 1/2
 In the first quarter of 2023, the FDA cleared the IND for the Phase 1/2 trial and granted Fast Track designation to TNG462. We plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in mid-2023. The clinical trial for TNG462 is similar to the TNG908 trial, wherein all cancers must have an MTAP deletion. Similar to TNG908, the dose expansion portion of the clinical trial will include a histology-agnostic cohort. Unlike TNG908, GBM patients will be excluded from the clinical trial as TNG462 is not expected to cross the blood-brain barrier.
TNG260, CoREST-Selective Inhibitor
Overview
 CoREST was discovered as a drug target with the potential to reverse the immune evasion associated with STK11 mutations using our immune evasion target discovery platform. This platform uses high throughput in vivo CRISPR-based target discovery screens to identify druggable targets that do not kill cancer cells directly, but rather attract immune cells to destroy them in the context of specific tumor suppressor gene loss.
 TNG260 is a novel small molecule inhibitor of the CoREST deacetylase complex that reverses checkpoint inhibitor resistance in STK11 mutant preclinical models. TNG260 is being developed in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody and is designed to reverse immune evasion in STK11-mutant cancers, with the aim of restoring sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibition. In preclinical studies, selective CoREST inhibition by TNG260 in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in complete regressions in ~60% of mice as a result of the transcriptional reprogramming of STK11-mutant tumor cells. In STK11-mutant cancers, TNG260 directly alters tumor cell cytokine secretion, markedly reduces recruitment of immune suppressive T regulatory cells, upregulates components of the antigen presentation machinery as well as PD-L1 on the tumor cell surface, which together lead to a more immunogenic tumor microenvironment. Preclinically, TNG260 in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in complete tumor regressions and prevented regrowth in STK11-mutant

tumors, inducing immune memory. STK11 loss-of-function mutations occur in approximately 15% of NSCLC, 15% of cervical, 10% carcinoma of unknown primary, 5% of breast and 3% of pancreatic cancers. We plan to file an IND for TNG260 in the first half of 2023.
 Mechanism of action
 STK11 mutant cancers have several key features that contribute to an immune checkpoint resistant tumor microenvironment, including low PD-L1 expression, low T effector cell infiltration, and high levels of immune suppressor T regulatory cells. Treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, such as anti-PD-1, is not sufficient to overcome the immune evasive environment of STK11-mutant tumors, leading to very limited clinical response in these patients. Inhibition of the CoREST complex by TNG260 has been shown to lead to changes in expression of immune-related genes that favor a more active immune environment. For example, TNG260 treatment leads to increased expression of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, which are cytokines responsible for recruiting T effector cells, therefore increasing the anti-tumor immune response when combined with anti-PD-1 antibody. Additionally, the combination of TNG260 with an anti-PD-1 antibody in preclinical studies leads to decreased expression of CCL1 and CCL22, which are chemokines responsible for recruiting immune suppressive regulatory T cells to the tumor environment. Together, this leads to an uncoupling of the levels of T effector and regulatory T cells in the tumor, which contributes to a more active immune microenvironment and re-sensitization to anti-PD-1 treatment.
 Target discovery
 Our state-of-the-art in vivo CRISPR discovery platform enabled the discovery of STK11 as a tumor suppressor gene that drives immune evasion when not functional in cancer cells. We engineered a syngeneic mouse tumor model in which STK11 loss-of-function drives resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. Applying our in vivo CRISPR screen in this STK11 loss-of-function model, HDAC1 was identified as a target that reversed anti-PD-1 resistance caused by STK11 deletion. Though HDAC1 is a component of three major regulatory complexes, we observed that TNG260 is highly selective and only inhibits the CoREST complex and spares the other two complexes (Sin3 and NuRD).
Preclinical data summary
In preclinical models, TNG260 demonstrated strong genetic and pharmacologic validation showing reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment and strong sensitization to anti-PD-1 therapy in STK11-deficient tumor models. In a syngeneic mouse tumor model where STK11 mutations drive resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, CoREST inhibition by TNG260 in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in complete tumor regressions in five out of eight treated mice. Treatment was stopped on Day 48 and the five of eight mice that were completely tumor-free at that time remained tumor-free for 21 days with no further treatment. Furthermore, when tumor cells were re-implanted in these mice on day 69, they were rejected, compared to a treatment-naïve group of animals where tumors grew as expected. This demonstrated the induction of immune memory in the animals with complete responses to TNG260 with anti-PD-1 antibody (Figure 12).
 Figure 12: Pharmacologic proof-of-concept for CoREST inhibition in STK11 mutant MC38 mice with TNG260 in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody



Planned clinical trials
Our Phase 1/2 first-in-human trial of TNG260 will evaluate the oral administration of TNG260 in combination with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) in patients with STK11-mutant solid tumors (Figure 12). As TNG260 is designed to work in combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies in tumors with STK11 loss, enrollment will be limited to patients with STK11 mutated tumors.
The dose escalation phase of this clinical trial will evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of TNG260 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer of any solid tumor histology with an STK11 mutation. Since efficacy with TNG260 requires combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody, TNG260 will be evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab. Following determination of the optimal efficacious dose, we will evaluate the efficacy of TNG260 plus pembrolizumab in indication-specific expansion arms including STK11 mutated NSCLC. In parallel, we will enroll a solid tumor, histology-agnostic cohort including cervical, pancreatic and breast cancer as well as carcinoma of unknown primary. We plan to file an IND for TNG260 in the first half of 2023.

TNG348, USP1 Inhibitor
Overview
 TNG348 is a novel allosteric inhibitor of USP1 for treatment of BRCA-mutant and other HRD+ cancers. USP1 was initially identified as a strong synthetic lethal target for BRCA1 loss-of-function using CRISPR-based screens in a panel of BRCA1-mutant versus wild-type cancer cell lines. In vivo preclinical studies of TNG348 have shown single agent efficacy and combination benefit with PARP inhibitors in BRCA1, BRCA2-mutant and other HRD+ cell-line and patient derived xenografts, including those that are intrinsically resistant to PARP inhibitors. These preclinical data further demonstrate that TNG348 is synergistic with PARP inhibition across a panel of human ovarian and breast cancer cell lines, including both PARP inhibitor sensitive and resistant models. Clinically, we expect TNG348 to have both single agent activity and combination benefit with PARP inhibitors in PARP inhibitor-naïve and PARP inhibitor-resistant BRCA1/2 mutant cancers and other HRD+ cancers. As such, USP1 has the potential to treat a patient population that is at least comparable in size to the PARP inhibitor market. BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are present in approximately 15% of ovarian cancers, 10% of breast cancers, 10% of prostate cancers, 5% of endometrial cancers and 5% of pancreatic cancers and additionally, BRCA wild-type HRD+ mutations are present in approximately 40% of ovarian, 15% of breast, 3% of prostate and 2% of pancreatic cancers. We expect to file an IND for TNG348 in mid-2023.
Mechanism of action
 While normal cells have multiple mechanisms to repair damaged DNA and prevent the associated cell death, tumors with BRCA1/2 mutations lack one of those mechanisms, the ability to repair double strand breaks. BRCA1/2 mutant and other HRD+ cancers rely in part on translesion synthesis (TLS) and base excision repair (BER) for DNA damage repair and cell survival. USP1 and PARP inhibitors exploit these dependencies by preventing efficient translesion synthesis and base excision repair respectively (See Figure 18). Clinically, blocking DNA damage repair to induce cancer cell death is a validated therapeutic strategy in oncology as exemplified by PARP inhibitors for the treatment of BRCA1/2 mutant cancers.
 Figure 13. Overview of DNA damage repair mechanism and how genetic alterations causing homologous recombination deficiency, such as BRCA1/2 loss, leads to a dependency on translesion synthesis (USP1) and base excision repair (PARP) pathways
 
USP1 is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that co-localizes with PCNA to DNA replication forks to ensure high-fidelity DNA replication. When mono-ubiquitinated PCNA (ub-PCNA) encounters DNA damage, USP1 removes ubiquitin from PCNA, switching synthesis to low fidelity TLS polymerases for gap filling and repair (See Figure 14). By inhibiting USP1, TNG348 blocks the ubiquitin removal from PCNA, driving PCNA poly-ubiquitination and degradation. This results in incomplete translesion synthesis repair. Ultimately, the replication stress induced by USP1 inhibition leads to decreased DNA synthesis, cell cycle arrest, and induction of cell death as detailed in our recent peer reviewed publication (Antione et al. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, 2023).

Figure 14. TNG348 blocks an important DNA damage repair pathway known as translesion synthesis. By inhibiting USP1 activity, TNG348 prevents the posttranslational modification of PCNA required to bypass DNA damage using low fidelity TLS polymerases for gap filling and repair
 
Preclinical data summary
The DNA damage repair pathways regulated by USP1 are not currently targeted by any marketed drug. Based on genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in the presence of our USP1 inhibitors, we validated that the activity of TNG348 converges on ubiquitination of PCNA, which represent a highly differentiated mechanism relative to other DNA damage repair enzyme inhibitors, including PARP inhibitors (Figures 13 and 14). Based on in vitro cell line profiling and ex vivo studies in patient-derived organoid cultures, we expect TNG348 to have both single agent activity and combination benefit with PARP inhibitors in PARP inhibitor-naïve and PARP inhibitor-resistant cancers. (See Figure 15 and Figure 16). Because USP1 inhibition blocks TLS and PARP inhibition blocks BER, the drug combination is highly synergistic resulting in tumor regression in multiple patient-derived xenograft models that are not sensitive to either single agent alone (Figure 17).
 Figure 15. TNG348 profiling using 7-14 day clongenic assays across a panel of sixty-one breast and ovarian cancer cell lines, including BRCA1/2 mutant and HRD+ models, show single agent activity and strong combination synergy with PARP inhibitors.

Collaboration and License Agreements
Collaboration and License Agreement with Gilead Sciences
In August 2020, we entered into an amended and restated research collaboration and license agreement, which we refer to as the Gilead Agreement, with Gilead. The Gilead Agreement expanded our 2018 collaboration with Gilead, or the 2018 Gilead Agreement. Pursuant to the Gilead Agreement we use our proprietary functional genomics-based discovery platform to identify and develop novel immune evasion targets during a seven-year period ending in August 2027, or the Research Term. During the Research Term, Gilead has the option to obtain exclusive, worldwide licenses to develop and commercialize products directed to up to 15 targets validated in the collaboration. Prior to exercising its option for a program, Gilead may “extend” such program, in which case we will further collaborate with Gilead during the Research Term to discover and develop immuno-oncology treatments directed to such target(s), potentially through early clinical development and be eligible to receive research extension payments from Gilead. Gilead will retain its option rights to any such extended

program. For up to five programs licensed by Gilead, we have the option to co-develop and co-promote the lead product for such program in the United States, subject to certain exceptions, and eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties on ex-U.S. sales.
Under the terms of the Gilead Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $125.0 million in addition to an upfront payment of $50.0 million received under the 2018 Gilead Agreement. We also received a $20.0 million equity investment in connection with the Gilead Agreement, and as of December 31, 2022, we received $21.1 million in license fees and $22.0 million in research option-extension fees. We are eligible to receive up to an additional $410.0 million per program in license, research extension, and clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone payments. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties in the first decile on net sales by Gilead on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of our patents or, in some instances, certain of Gilead’s patents, in each case covering such product in such country or (ii) ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. For those products that we opt to co-develop and co-promote in the United States, we and Gilead will equally split profits and losses from the sales of such products in the United States, as well as development costs for such products attributable to the United States.
 Either party may terminate the Gilead Agreement if the other party materially breaches the terms of such agreement, subject to specified notice and cure provisions, or enters into bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. Additionally, Gilead may terminate the agreement for any or no reason, in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis, upon specified written notice. If we terminate the Gilead Agreement for Gilead’s material breach, or Gilead terminates the Gilead Agreement without cause, then Gilead is obligated to negotiate with us in good faith for a specified period regarding the transfer by Gilead of certain assets and the provision by Gilead of certain assistance to enable us to continue the research, development and commercialization of products under any terminated programs.
To date, Gilead has licensed two of our programs and has research option-extended two programs under the Gilead agreements.
Our collaboration with Gilead excludes our lead programs, PRMT5, CoREST, USP1 as well as a growing pipeline of novel targets identified in our non-immune related target discovery screens. We also retain the right to identify and validate targets outside the scope of our collaboration with Gilead (all cell-autonomous targets, exclusive of those in immune evasion contexts), and to develop and commercialize products directed to such targets, on our own or in collaboration with third parties.
 License Agreement with Medivir AB
In March 2020, we entered into a license agreement, or the Medivir Agreement, with Medivir AB, or Medivir, pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, royalty-bearing, exclusive license under certain current and/or future patents and know-how of Medivir, to research, develop and commercialize products that are covered by such licensed patents or otherwise modulate USP1.
Under the terms of the Medivir Agreement, we are obligated to pay Medivir in connection with development, regulatory and commercial activities. We have agreed to make certain milestone payments of (i) $1.4 million in the aggregate for the first licensed product that achieves specified clinical milestones plus $25.0 million for the first licensed product that achieves specified regulatory approval and sales milestones, in each case, in either of the first two specified genetic contexts and (ii) $0.7 million in the aggregate if that first licensed product achieves specified clinical milestones plus $5.0 million if that first licensed product achieves specified regulatory and sales milestones for a third genetic context or the second licensed product achieves such specified development, regulatory and sales milestones in either of the first two specified genetic contexts. We have the right to reduce these milestone payments by a specified amount in the event the licensed product is not covered by Medivir’s patents or if payments are due to a third party for a license under such third party’s intellectual property rights. We are also obligated to pay Medivir a low single-digit royalty on net sales of any product covered by a licensed patent.
Payments in respect of net sales or sublicense in a country shall remain in force on a product-by-product, country-by-country basis, with respect to products that are not covered by a licensed patent or certain of our patents, for ten years from the date of first commercial sale in such country, and products that are covered by a licensed patent or certain of our patents, until the expiration date of the last to expire of the licensed patents covering such product or its manufacture or use in the applicable country. No milestones have been achieved to date.

The Medivir Agreement expires on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations. Either party may terminate the Medivir Agreement earlier upon an uncured material breach of the other party.
Manufacturing
Our lead investigational products are small molecule inhibitors that can be readily manufactured without requiring any specialized equipment or processes. We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations, or CDMOs for the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and distribution of our investigational products for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if any of our investigational products obtain marketing approval. A team of internal experts oversee activities at contracted CDMOs with the goal of ensuring our investigational products are being manufactured under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. Currently, all manufacturing of our product candidates drug substance and drug product to be used in our planned clinical trial in the U.S. is conducted by one manufacturer. We believe that the contracted CDMO has the capacity to support our planned registrational studies, in addition to the first-in-human studies for our product candidates. The operations of the CDMO manufacturing drug substance and drug product are located outside the U.S. and, therefore, in addition to the sole-source risks related to this CDMO, we may also encounter challenges related to supply chain, climate issues, pandemic and geopolitical risks. We plan to expand and diversify our supply chain by identifying and contracting other CDMOs with the capacity and expertise to support our product candidates and other investigational products in our pipeline and to manufacture commercial supply of our drugs (if those therapies obtain regulatory approval).
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business and our product candidates, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary target discovery technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of precision oncology that may be important for the development of our business and product candidates. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions, where available. Patent rights and regulatory protections are key factors that determine the period of market exclusivity for products in our industry. It is during the period of market exclusivity that, we believe, our potential future products have their greatest commercial value.
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to limit third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our product candidates (and any future products that may be approved for marketing by regulatory authorities) may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents, or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, enforcement of these rights may depend on third-party licensors. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same and to the extent such patents are commercially useful in protecting our commercial products or methods of manufacturing, such patents may be challenged or invalidated or otherwise become less useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing.
Because a significant portion of a pharmaceutical product’s patent protection can elapse during the course of developing and obtaining regulatory approval of the product, certain countries, including the U.S., provide compensatory mechanisms to extend patent terms for pharmaceutical products. Patent expiration dates noted in the following paragraphs refer to statutory expiration dates and do not take into account any potential patent term adjustment or extension that may be available, or any potential disclaimers that may be needed to obtain certain patents that may reduce the term of such patents to correspond to that of earlier-expiring patents. There is no guarantee that any of our product candidates would be eligible for patent term extensions.
PRMT5 inhibitors
We exclusively own three patent families covering the composition of matter, form and methods of use for our product candidates TNG908, TNG462 and other structurally related PRMT5 inhibitors. For the first family, a US patent has been granted, and patent applications are pending in the United States, Argentina, Pakistan, Taiwan, Australia, Brazil,

Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand and South Africa. Any patents granted in this family would be expected to expire no earlier than 2041. A Patent Cooperation Treaty application is pending in the second family, and any patents granted in this family would be expected to expire no earlier than 2042. A provisional United States patent application is pending in the third family, and any patents granted in this family would be expected to expire no earlier than 2043.
Additionally, we exclusively own six patent families covering other PRMT5 inhibitors and their methods of use with expiration dates ranging from 2039 to 2043. A US patent has been granted and a US patent application is pending in the first family. A US patent application is pending in the second family. Patent Cooperation Treaty applications are pending in the remaining four families.
USP1 inhibitors
We own two patent families covering USP1 inhibitors and methods of use thereof. Patent Cooperation Treaty applications are pending in both families. Any patents issuing from each of these two patent families are expected to expire no earlier than 2042. One of the patent families is exclusively owned by us, and the remaining one is jointly owned by us and Medivir AB and exclusively licensed to us under the Medivir Agreement.
CoREST inhibitors
 We exclusively own two patent families relating to our CoREST inhibitor program, including composition of matter and methods of use thereof. A Patent Cooperation Treaty application is pending in the first family, and a provisional application is pending in the second family. Any issued patents, if granted, covering the composition of matter for our CoREST inhibitor, or methods of use thereof, are expected to expire no earlier than 2042.
 Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, clinical trials, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, recordkeeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs. We, along with our vendors, contract research organizations, or CROs, clinical investigators and contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, its implementing regulations, and other federal statutes and regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements at any time with respect to product development, clinical testing, approval or any other regulatory requirements relating to product manufacture, processing, handling, storage, quality control, safety, pharmacovigilance, marketing, advertising, promotion, packaging, labeling, export, import, distribution or sale, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
Our product candidates must be approved for therapeutic indications by the FDA before they may be marketed in the United States. For drug product candidates regulated under the FD&C Act, FDA must approve a New Drug Application, or NDA. The process generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements; 
 •completion of the manufacture, under cGMP conditions, of the drug substance and drug product to be used in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually and when certain changes are made (for example, we received clearance of our IND application for TNG908 in the first quarter of 2022); 


•approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated at that site; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •satisfactory completion of FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; 
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA, including, where applicable, consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. 
 Preclinical studies and clinical trials for drugs
Before testing any drug in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulation and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety/toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND.
An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. An IND includes the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies, the results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a full or partial clinical hold. A clinical hold can also be imposed once a trial has already begun, thereby halting the trial until any safety concerns or deficiencies articulated by FDA are corrected.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, who generally are physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, inclusion and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable compared to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. Information about clinical trials, including results for clinical trials other than Phase 1 investigations, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on www.ClinicalTrials.gov, a clinical trials database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, FDA may nevertheless accept the results of the study in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP

requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through independent analysis and an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1 — Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product in a limited population of healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion of the investigational product in humans, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2 — Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the drug’s potential efficacy, to determine the optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
 •Phase 3 — Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
 In the first quarter of 2022, we received clearance of our IND application for TNG908 to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. In the first quarter of 2023, we received clearance of our IND application for TNG462 to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial.
In March 2022, the FDA released final guidance titled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how drug developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology drug development (i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial) to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in IND applications and assessed by FDA. Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to drug development and reduce development costs and time.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials or post-marketing studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the completion of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of NDA approval.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 days for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human volunteers and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. marketing approval for drugs
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA package requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy for the requested indications and the marketing

application is required to include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug to the satisfaction of the FDA. The FDA must approve an NDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States.
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs to ensure they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective for the indications sought and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards, including cGMP requirements, designed to assure and preserve the product’s continued identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and 6 months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA for Priority Review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee.
The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, if it believes such a strategy is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. A REMS can include use of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies such as medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, special monitoring or other risk-minimization tools.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. The FDA may require additional clinical or preclinical testing or recommend other actions, such as requests for additional information or clarification, that the applicant might take in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for one or more indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, although companies developing orphan-designated products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product.
Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity.
Expedited development and review programs for drugs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to get important new drugs to patients more quickly than standard FDA review timelines typically permit.
A new drug is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed. Rolling review means that the FDA may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application. In the first quarter of 2022 and 2023, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for TNG908 and TNG462, respectively.
In addition, a new drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance.
 Products with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval. Any product submitted to the FDA for approval that has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition may be eligible for priority review. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal date to take action on the marketing application is six months compared to ten months for a standard review. Products are eligible for Accelerated Approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
Accelerated Approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, adequate and well-controlled post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit and, under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA may require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior

to approval or within a specific time period after the date accelerated approval is granted. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or an indication approved under Accelerated Approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, these FDA programs do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval, though they may expedite the development or review process.
Pediatric information and pediatric exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, certain NDAs and NDA supplements must contain data that can be used to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The PREA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product candidate that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to a drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted, except that PREA will apply to an original NDA for a new active ingredient that is orphan-designated if the drug is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.
A drug can also obtain pediatric exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study that adequately responds to an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
U.S. post-approval requirements for drugs
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences and promotion and advertising requirements. FDA's advertising and promotion requirements include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe approved products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, including not only by company employees but also by agents of the company or those speaking on the company’s behalf, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, including liabilities under the False Claims Act where products are reimbursed under federal health care programs. Promotional materials for approved drugs must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, for certain modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain prior FDA approval of an NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, as well as the manufacturing process for making the drug to confirm continued compliance with cGMP. Manufacturers and certain subcontractors must register their establishments with the FDA and applicable state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections for compliance with regulatory requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and, depending on the nature of the change, may require prior FDA approval before implementation. In addition, manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain must comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and notify the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution. Accordingly, manufacturers must

continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other regulatory requirements.
 The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; 
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and 
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information. 
Regulation of companion diagnostics
Companion diagnostics provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug. A companion diagnostic may be used to help identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product, identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product, or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. In the United States, the FD&C Act, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption or FDA exercise of enforcement discretion applies, diagnostic tests generally require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercialization. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are clearance of a premarket notification, or 510(k), and approval of a PMA.
The FDA has issued several guidance documents regarding the co-development of drugs and companion diagnostic tests, including a 2014 final guidance titled “Guidance for Industry: In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices”, a 2016 draft guidance titled “Principles for Codevelopment of an In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Device with a Therapeutic Product,” and a 2018 draft guidance titled “Developing and Labeling In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices for a Specific Group or Class of Oncology Therapeutic Products. Once cleared or approved, the companion diagnostic device must adhere to applicable post-marketing requirements including the FDA’s quality system regulation (QSR), adverse event reporting, recalls and corrections, and product marketing requirements and limitations. Like drug manufacturers, companion diagnostic manufacturers are subject to unannounced FDA inspections at any time during which the FDA will conduct an audit of the product(s) and the company’s facilities for compliance with regulatory requirements.
Other regulatory matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, and commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the HHS, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.

Other healthcare laws
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we will seek to obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to certain liabilities and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval in the future. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, on the other. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 
 •The federal civil and criminal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The federal False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the federal False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery.
 •The federal civil monetary penalties laws impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer or remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary, if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies. 
 •HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity may be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it.
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their respective business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
 •Federal price reporting laws, which require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on approved products
 •The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, imposed new 


annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors, as well as certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
•Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may be broader in scope than the provisions described above and may apply regardless of payor. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and relevant federal government compliance guidance; require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers; restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information. State and foreign laws may govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts.
 The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Insurance Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. Coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, which will require additional expenditure above and beyond the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Some product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition (when a product candidate is approved for marketing). Levels of coverage and reimbursement for a product can differ significantly from payor to payor.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments (and other third-party payers), and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time.

In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
 Current and future healthcare reform legislation
In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For example, in 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. The ACA includes provisions of importance to our potential product candidates that:
•created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 
 •expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; 
 •expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices; 
 •expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; 
 •established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide point-of-sale-discounts off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and 
 •created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. 
 •On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. President Biden has issued multiple executive orders that have sought to reduce prescription drug costs. In February 2023, HHS issued a proposal in response to an October 2022 executive order from President Biden that includes a proposed prescription drug

pricing model that will test whether targeted Medicare payment adjustments will sufficiently incentivize manufacturers to complete confirmatory trials for drugs approved through FDA’s accelerated approval pathway. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, includes several provisions that may impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that reduce the out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries from $7,050 to $2,000 starting in 2025, thereby effectively eliminating the coverage gap; impose new manufacturer financial liability on certain drugs under Medicare Part D; and allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition. Specifically, under the IRA, a single-source pharmaceutical product qualifies for selection for participation in the drug price negotiation program if it is (i) a small-molecule drug for which at least seven years have passed since the date of approval from the FDA and there is no generic on the market (as of the date of selection); or (ii) a biologic for which 11 years have passed since the date of FDA licensure and there is no biosimilar on the market (as of the date of selection). Given that any negotiated price does not take effect until approximately two years after selection, small-molecule drug and biologic manufacturers are afforded at least nine years and 13 years, respectively, before they may be obligated to sell their product under Medicare Part B and Part D, as applicable, at CMS-negotiated pricing. The IRA also requires companies to pay rebates to Medicare to the extent that drug pricing increases faster than inflation, and it also further delayed until January 1, 2032 the implementation of the HHS rebate rule that would have limited the fees that pharmacy benefit managers can charge.
We expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. Federal Government will pay for healthcare drugs and services, which could result in reduced demand for our drug candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain drug access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs (if approved for marketing) or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization.
Other United States environmental, health and safety laws and regulations
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses that we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or

production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
Government regulation of drugs outside of the United States
To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, manufacturing, commercial sales, promotion and distribution of our potential future products. For instance, in the European Economic Area, or the EEA (comprised of the 27 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), medicinal products must be authorized for marketing by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
•Centralized procedure — The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid throughout the EEA. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products (gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, which includes products for the treatment of cancer. For medicines that do not fall within one of the mandatory categories, an applicant still has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EEA. If pursuing marketing authorization of a product candidate for a therapeutic indication under the centralized procedure, the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, is responsible for conducting an initial assessment of whether a product meets the required quality, safety and efficacy requirements, and whether a product has a positive benefit/risk ratio. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. 
 
•National authorization procedures — There are also two other possible routes to authorize products for therapeutic indications in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 
 oUsing the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EEA Member State for a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any EEA Member State and that does not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. 
 oIn the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EEA Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, additional marketing authorizations can be sought from other EEA Member States in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 
 In both cases, as with the centralized procedure, the competent authorities of the EEA Member States assess the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy before granting the marketing authorization.
Now that the United Kingdom has left the European Union, Great Britain is no longer covered by the EEA procedures for the grant of marketing authorizations described above (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized European Union marketing authorizations continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland) and a separate marketing authorization is therefore required to market drugs in Great Britain. For three years from January 1, 2021, the UK’s regulator, the MHRA, may adopt decisions taken by the European Commission on the approval of new marketing authorizations through the centralized procedure, and the MHRA will have regard to marketing authorizations approved in a country in the EEA (although in both

cases a marketing authorization will only be granted if any Great Britain-specific requirements are met). This is known as the EC Decision Reliance Procedure. On January 24, 2023, the MHRA announced that a new international recognition framework will be put in place from January 1, 2024, which will have regard to decisions on the approval of marketing authorizations made by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and certain other regulators. On February 27, 2023, the UK government and the European Commission announced a political agreement in principle to replace the Northern Ireland Protocol with a new set of arrangements, known as the “Windsor Framework”. This new framework fundamentally changes the existing system under the Northern Ireland Protocol, including with respect to the regulation of medicinal products in the UK. In particular, the MHRA will be responsible for approving all medicinal products destined for the UK market (Great Britain and Northern Ireland) and the EMA will no longer have any role in approving medicinal products destined for Northern Ireland. A single UK-wide marketing authorization will be granted by the MHRA for all medicinal products to be sold in the UK, enabling products to be sold in a single pack and under a single authorization throughout the UK. Once the Windsor Framework is approved by the EU-UK Joint Committee, the UK Government and the European Union will enact legislative measures to enact it into law.
 In the EEA, new products for therapeutic indications that are authorized for marketing (i.e., innovator products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the innovator product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EEA during a period of eight years from the date on which the innovator product was first authorized in the EEA. The additional two-year period of market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EEA until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the European Union. The overall ten-year period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on a MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EEA are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, in the EEA a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if it meets the following criteria: (i) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; and (ii) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EEA when the application is made, or (b) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the EEA to justify the investment needed for its development; and (iii) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year orphan market exclusivity period, no marketing authorization application shall be accepted, and no marketing authorization shall be granted for a similar medicinal product for the same indication, unless certain conditions are met. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the national competent authority, or NCA, of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee, or EC, has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by applicable directives. All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.

Government regulation of data collection outside of the United States
In the event we conduct clinical trials in the European Union, we will be subject to additional privacy restrictions. The collection and use of personal health data in the European Economic Area, or EEA (being the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein), is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data by any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA to the extent they process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, enhanced requirements for securing personal data, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, and creates direct obligations on service providers acting as processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in fines of up to 4% of a company’s global revenue for the preceding financial year, or €20,000,000, whichever is greater. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, maintaining compliance with the GDPR will require significant time, resources and expense, and we will be required to put in place controls and processes ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. There has been limited enforcement of the GDPR to date, particularly in biopharmaceutical development, so we face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements on any future trials and we may be unsuccessful in implementing all measures required by data protection authorities or courts in interpretation of the new law. Further, the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, means that it has in force its own legislation which is aligned with the GDPR, known as the Data Protection Act 2018. The requirements are similar except that the United Kingdom is now regarded as a “third country” for the purposes of transfers of personal data from the EEA. Transfers continue to flow freely from the United Kingdom to the EEA; however, as part of the agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union, the United Kingdom intends to obtain an adequacy decision from the European Commission to ensure personal data can continue to flow freely from the European Union to the United Kingdom.
Data protection authority activity differs across the European Union, with certain authorities applying their own agenda which shows there is uncertainty in the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. For example, it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the European Union, or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated. Enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring GDPR compliance are onerous and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Should we utilize third-party distributors, compliance with such foreign governmental regulations would generally be the responsibility of such distributors, who may be independent contractors over whom we have limited control.
 Competition
We face direct competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies leveraging the principle of synthetic lethality as well as companies developing therapies for the same target pathway and the same indications. Well-established companies that are developing or may develop therapies based on synthetic lethality include AstraZeneca, Amgen, GlaxoSmithKline, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck KGaA and Pfizer. Smaller and earlier-stage companies focused on synthetic lethality include Artios Pharma, KSQ Therapeutics, IDEAYA Biosciences, Mirati Therapeutics, Repare Therapeutics and Servier Pharmaceuticals.
Our PRMT5 inhibitor programs, which includes TNG908 and TNG462, will face direct competition from companies that have clinical-stage, MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors that are selective for MTAP-deleted cancers. We are aware that Mirati Therapeutics and Amgen are in Phase 1/2 clinical trials with MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor programs, using the same mechanism of action as TNG908 and TNG462. Currently, there are no MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors that are authorized for marketing by any regulatory authority.
Indirect competition may come from MAT2A inhibitor programs that are uniquely different than the TNG908 and TNG462 mechanism of action but are synthetic lethal with MTAP-deletions. MAT2A is an enzyme upstream of PRMT5 essential for the metabolism of the PRMT5 co-factor SAM that acts on the same pathway as TNG908. We are aware that

IDEAYA Biosciences (IDE397) has a clinical program and Servier Pharmaceuticals (S95035) has a preclinical MAT2A inhibitor program.
We are not aware of any competition from other companies developing a similar mechanism as TNG260, our CoREST inhibitor program.
 Competition for TNG348, our USP1 inhibitor program, comes from KSQ Therapeutics, which has a USP1 program in clinical development. Additionally, in March 2023, Debiopharm acquired global rights to a USP1 inhibitor in late preclinical development.
 We face competition more broadly across the oncology market for safe, efficacious, and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation, and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, biologic therapy (such as monoclonal and bispecific antibodies), immunotherapy, cell-based therapy and targeted therapy, or a combination of any such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drugs and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market may pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new oncology therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, have significantly greater resources, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement, and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Additionally, mergers and acquisitions may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 Attracting and retaining qualified and experienced employees in research and development, clinical, manufacturing, quality and other positions is crucial to our ability to compete effectively. Competition for these employees is intense in the pharmaceutical industry in which we operate. Our ability to recruit and retain such employees depends on a number of factors, including the growth of our organization, the culture and work environment we have created, our organizational values and goals and our corporate philosophy; talent development and career opportunities; and compensation and benefits.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 110 full-time employees, 84 employees are engaged in research and development and 26 are engaged in business development, finance, legal, and general management and administration. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Talent Acquisition and Employee Development:
 Our principal talent acquisition goal is to attract, retain, and develop the highest quality talent. As we build our organization beyond drug discovery and drug development, our goals have been extended to include establishing an employee base that will allow us to efficiently move our pipeline products through clinical trials, regulatory approvals and into the market where we can help patients and their families and, simultaneously, to have a workforce that provides diverse backgrounds and ideas, are trained to operate and act at the highest standards of ethics and integrity, and are dedicated to achieve the highest level of innovation and to advance oncology treatments through the use of synthetic lethality. To support our talent acquisition, our human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for leadership positions in the future; reward employees through competitive benefits programs, including competitive pay, incentive compensation, and an equity program that aligns the incentives of our employees with the interests of our shareholders; enhance our culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; and retain and develop talent that embody our core values.
Diversity:


While Tango is early in its corporate development, our employees represent a broad set of backgrounds, perspectives and experiences. We attribute our early growth and success to the diversity that our employees bring with them to their professional roles. We are committed to the goals of diversity, equity and inclusion, which is the foundation upon which we are building a leading synthetic lethality business that is pushing the advances in oncology care, all with the objective of benefiting patients. We are building a work environment where employees can express themselves and have a voice in how we operate. Among other things, members of our management meet in small group sessions with all employees throughout the year and the feedback in these meetings is used to drive our professional development programs, our compensation structure, our organizational development and our culture.
Tango has also recently established a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) Council in which a broad, cross-section of our employees are members. The DE&I Council is responsible for initiatives that prioritize building a diverse workforce and creating an environment that is equitable and inclusive for all employees and employee candidates. The DE&I Council has led company-wide education efforts to inform our employees and our management team of the challenges employees face in the work environment so actions can be taken throughout the organization to support a range of diversity, equity and inclusion causes.
Further, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter sets forth specific guidelines that the Committee will use in evaluating future individuals for nomination to the Board of Directors. Among the identified factors the Committee is to consider in nominating a candidate is the diversity of a candidate. The Board recognizes that diversity plays an important role in its functioning and operations.
 These and similar programs are important to develop a sense of belonging for all employees and for our Board of Directors.
 Employee Engagement:
 We survey our employees on an annual basis to assess overall engagement of our workforce, and compare our engagement results against prior year results, as well as a set of benchmark companies. These companies are in the biotech sector and of similar size (number of employees). We use these results, both our internal results and the comparative results against the benchmark companies, to assess our employee engagement performance during the preceding year and to determine areas of focus going forward.
 Following the 2021 engagement survey, we were able to implement a number of initiatives in response to employee feedback, including updating our vacation policy and adopting policies designed to improve employee wellness. In our most recent survey, conducted in 2022, we continued to generate results that were generally higher than our benchmark dataset, which supports our view that we have positive employee engagement. We identified areas where we are performing well, such as our efforts around innovation and social connection. As is the case with every survey, we also used the data to identify areas where we want to focus our efforts for improvement, including employee empowerment. As was the case in 2022, we will take these 2022 results, and a task force has been formed to enable actions that will further improve our engagement.
We also conduct regular townhall meetings with our employees that are intended to keep our employees updated on important corporate initiatives and to obtain input from employees on these initiatives. We also use periodic employee surveys so we can quickly obtain employee feedback on new programs or policies that are under consideration.
