The Company has conducted extensive research and has identified specific channels to penetrate with its new portfolio of novel technologies. The Company has begun to execute this vision and has launched the first product line called ‘Breathe ™’, through our manufacturing partner, The Starco Group. The Company has applied for a registered trademark for Breathe with the United States Patent and Trade Office. Breathe is an environmentally-friendly line of household cleaning aerosol products. It is the worlds first aerosol household cleaning line to be approved by the EPAs Safer Choice program. This product line is biodegradable and is propelled by nitrogen, which makes up approximately 80% of the earths breathable air. Breathe was named Partner of the Year by the EPAs Safer Choice Program for 2018, a tremendous honor.
 
The Breathe line is currently on shelves in all Wegmans stores, almost 1,000 Walmart stores, almost 300 stores serviced through UNFI and is currently shipping its first load in to all Menards and all Home Depots. The Company executed a deal with Centeral Garden Excel (Central), one of the largest distributors to the DIY/Hardware retail channel. Central will be handling all of the Companys distribution to Home Depot and are currently presenting to others that are considered to be competitive players to Home Depot. The Company has also begun to implement its online sales strategy and Breathe is now available on Amazon. Breathe is currently being presented to a few other national retailers in the United States and the prospects of landing more is strong. 
 
The Company also launched their first product in personal care, Honu Sunscreen was launched in 1,700 Walmart stores in 2018 with increased sales expected in 2019. Honu is a reef friendly and family safe SPF 50 with 80 minutes of water resistance that comes with a patented spray wand to spray all your hard to reach spots. The Spray Wand is patented and owned by a third party. Honu is a sun screen spray that management anticipates will lead the Company to offering other personal care items under this brand. Honu won Product of Year for skin care, which is the largest consumer voted award for product innovation. Product of the Year is voted on by 40,000 consumers. www.productoftheyearusa.com. The Company is expecting to extend the Honu line by 2020.
 
The Company also became the marketer of record for Betterbilts Kleen Out branded drain opener and for the Winona Popcorn Spray. Both products are available in all Walmart stores. The Company is being paid a royalty stream for its role. Through the Companys relationship with its marketing partner Deutsch Marketing, the Company is launching a new label in April 2019 for Winona Popcorn Spray throughout all Walmart stores. 
 
In addition, the Company plans to launch other products in air care, food, personal care, spirits and beverages over the next 60 months. Although the initial market reception to our new lines has been encouraging, the Company may encounter a number of hurdles that could prevent this and future product launches from achieving sustained commercial success. 
 
The Company established a seed financing round in 2017 to raise capital through the issuance and sale of the Companys common stock. The Company started its seed financing on August 18, 2017 and closed it by October 25, 2017, raising a total of $600,000. The Company has a positive outlook on receiving royalty revenues that have progressively grown since the commercialization of our first product. We may need to rely on sales of our common stock in order to raise additional capital. The purchasers and manner of issuance will be determined according to our financial needs and the available exemptions to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.  
 
The Companys ultimate goal is to become a leading brand owner and third-party marketer of cutting edge technologies in the consumer marketplace whose success is expected to increase shareholder value. The Company will continue to evaluate this and other opportunities to further set its strategy for 2019 and beyond.
