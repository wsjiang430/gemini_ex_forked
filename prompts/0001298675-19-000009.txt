     ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
     Overview
     We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate company focused primarily on the ownership, operation, management, acquisition, and development of self-storage properties in the United States.
     As of December 31, 2018, we owned 493 self-storage properties located in 23 states and in the District of Columbia containing an aggregate of approximately 34.6 million rentable square feet.  As of December 31, 2018, approximately 89.0% of the rentable square footage at our owned stores was leased to approximately 289,500 customers, and no single customer represented a significant concentration of our revenues. As of December 31, 2018, we owned stores in the District of Columbia and the following 23 states:  Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia.  In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we managed 593 stores for third parties (including 151 stores containing an aggregate of approximately 9.0 million net rentable square feet as part of five separate unconsolidated real estate ventures) bringing the total number of stores we owned and/or managed to 1,086.  As of December 31, 2018, we managed stores for third parties in the District of Columbia and the following 34 states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.
     Our self-storage properties are designed to offer affordable and easily-accessible storage space for our residential and commercial customers.  Our customers rent storage cubes for their exclusive use, typically on a month-to-month basis. Additionally, some of our stores offer outside storage areas for vehicles and boats.  Our stores are designed to accommodate both residential and commercial customers, with features such as wide aisles and load-bearing capabilities for large truck access.  All of our stores have a storage associate available to assist our customers during business hours, and 287, or approximately 58.2%, of our owned stores have a manager who resides in an apartment at the store.  Our customers can access their storage cubes during business hours, and some of our stores provide customers with 24-hour access through computer-controlled access systems.  Our goal is to provide customers with the highest standard of physical attributes and service in the industry. To that end, 419, or approximately 85.0%, of our owned stores include climate-controlled cubes.
     The Parent Company was formed in July 2004 as a Maryland REIT.  The Parent Company owns its assets and conducts its business through the Operating Partnership, and its subsidiaries.  The Parent Company controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner and, as of December 31, 2018, owned an approximately 99.0% interest in the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership was formed in July 2004 as a Delaware limited partnership and has been engaged in virtually all aspects of the self-storage business, including the development, acquisition, management, ownership, and operation of self-storage properties.
     Acquisition and Disposition Activity
     As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we owned 493 and 484 stores, respectively, that contained an aggregate of 34.6 million and 33.8 million rentable square feet with occupancy levels of 89.0% and 89.2%, respectively. A complete listing of, and additional information

     The comparability of our results of operations is affected by the timing of acquisition and disposition activities during the periods reported.  As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we owned 493, 484, and 475 self-storage properties and related assets, respectively.  The following table summarizes the change in number of owned stores from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018:

      Financing and Investing Activities
     The following summarizes certain financing and investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018:
    
· | Store Acquisitions. During 2018, we acquired ten self-storage properties located throughout the United States, including one store upon completion of construction and the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $227.5 million. In connection with these acquisitions, we allocated a portion of the purchase price paid for each store to the intangible value of in-place leases which aggregated $11.3 million. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Development Activity. During 2018, we completed construction and opened for operation one joint venture store located in New York. As of December 31, 2018, we had six joint venture development properties under construction located in New York (3), Massachusetts (2), and New Jersey (1) which are expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2018, we had invested $82.6 million of an expected $160.0 million, related to these six projects. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Store Dispositions. On November 28, 2018, we sold two stores in Arizona for an aggregate sales price of approximately $17.5 million. In connection with these sales, we recorded gains that totaled approximately $10.6 million. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | At-The-Market Equity Program. During 2018, under our at-the-market equity program, we sold a total of 4.3 million common shares at an average sales price of $31.09 per share, resulting in net proceeds for the year under the program of $131.8 million, after deducting offering costs. As of December 31, 2018, 10.5 million common shares remained available for sale under the program. We used the proceeds from the 2018 sales to fund acquisitions of self-storage properties and for general corporate purposes.

· | Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures. During 2018, 191 IV CUBE LLC, an unconsolidated real estate venture in which we own a 20% interest, acquired 12 stores for an aggregate purchase price of $129.4 million, of which we contributed $14.1

million. The acquired stores were located in Arizona (2), Connecticut (2), Florida (3), Georgia (2), Maryland (1), and Texas (2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Business Strategy
     Our business strategy consists of several elements:
    
· | Maximize cash flow from our stores — Our operating strategy focuses on maximizing sustainable rents at our stores while achieving and sustaining occupancy targets. We utilize our operating systems and experienced personnel to manage the balance between rental rates, discounts, and physical occupancy with an objective of maximizing our rental revenue. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Acquire stores within targeted markets — During 2019, we intend to pursue selective acquisitions in markets that we believe have high barriers to entry, strong demographic fundamentals, and demand for storage in excess of storage capacity. We believe the self-storage industry will continue to afford us opportunities for growth through acquisitions due to the highly fragmented composition of the industry. In the past, we have formed joint ventures with unaffiliated third parties, and in the future we may form additional joint ventures to facilitate the funding of future developments or acquisitions. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Dispose of stores — During 2019, we intend to continue to evaluate opportunities to dispose of assets that have unattractive risk adjusted returns. We intend to use proceeds from these transactions to fund acquisitions within targeted markets. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Grow our third-party management business — We intend to pursue additional third-party management opportunities. We intend to leverage our current platform to take advantage of consolidation in the industry. We plan to utilize our relationships with third-party owners to help source future acquisitions and other investment opportunities. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Investment and Market Selection Process
     We maintain a disciplined and focused process in the acquisition and development of self-storage properties.  Our investment committee, comprised of four senior officers and led by Christopher P. Marr, our Chief Executive Officer, oversees our investment process.  Our investment process involves six stages — identification, initial due diligence, economic assessment, investment committee approval (and when required, the approval of our Board of Trustees (the “Board”)), final due diligence, and documentation.  Through our investment committee, we intend to focus on the following criteria:
· | Targeted markets — Our targeted markets include areas where we currently maintain management that can be extended to additional stores, or where we believe that we can acquire a significant number of stores efficiently and within a short period of time. We evaluate both the broader market and the immediate area, typically three miles around the store, for its ability to support above-average demographic growth. We seek to increase our presence primarily in areas that we expect will experience growth, including the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic areas of the United States and areas within Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, and Texas, and to enter additional markets should suitable opportunities arise. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Quality of store — We focus on self-storage properties that have good visibility and are located near retail centers, which typically provide high traffic corridors and are generally located near residential communities and commercial customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Growth potential — We target acquisitions that offer growth potential through increased operating efficiencies and, in some cases, through additional leasing efforts, renovations, or expansions. In addition to acquiring single stores, we seek to invest in portfolio acquisitions, including those offering significant potential for increased operating efficiency and the ability to spread our fixed costs across a large base of stores. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Segment
     We have one reportable segment: we own, operate, develop, manage, and acquire self-storage properties.
     Concentration
     Our self-storage properties are located in major metropolitan areas as well as suburban areas and have numerous customers per store.  No single customer represented a significant concentration of our 2018 revenues. Our stores in Florida, New York, Texas, and California provided approximately 17%, 16%, 10% and 8%, respectively, of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

     Seasonality
     We typically experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels at our stores, with the levels generally slightly higher during the summer months due to increased moving activity.     Financing Strategy
     We maintain a capital structure that we believe is reasonable and prudent and that will enable us to have ample cash flow to cover debt service and make distributions to our shareholders.  As of December 31, 2018, our debt to total capitalization ratio (determined by dividing the carrying value of our total indebtedness by the sum of (a) the market value of the Parent Company’s outstanding common shares and units of the Operating Partnership held by third parties and (b) the carrying value of our total indebtedness) was approximately 24.4% compared to approximately 23.5% as of December 31, 2017.  Our ratio of debt to the undepreciated cost of our total assets as of December 31, 2018 was approximately 37.9% compared to approximately 38.0% as of December 31, 2017.  We expect to finance additional investments in self-storage properties through the most attractive sources of capital available at the time of the transaction, in a manner consistent with maintaining a strong financial position and future financial flexibility, subject to limitations on incurrence of indebtedness in our unsecured credit facilities and the indenture that governs our unsecured notes.  These capital sources may include existing cash, borrowings under the revolving portion of our credit facility, additional secured or unsecured financings, sales of common or preferred shares of the Parent Company in public offerings or private placements, additional issuances of debt securities, issuances of common or preferred units in our Operating Partnership in exchange for contributed properties, and formations of joint ventures.  We also may sell stores that have unattractive risk adjusted returns and use the sales proceeds to fund other acquisitions.     Competition
     Self-storage properties compete based on a number of factors, including location, rental rates, security, suitability of the store’s design to prospective customers’ needs, and the manner in which the store is operated and marketed.  In particular, the number of competing self-storage properties in a market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates, and on the overall operating performance of our stores.  We believe that the primary competition for potential customers of any of our self-storage properties comes from other self-storage providers within a three-mile radius of that store.  We believe our stores are well-positioned within their respective markets, and we emphasize customer service, convenience, security, professionalism, and cleanliness.
     Our key competitors include local and regional operators as well as the other public self-storage REITs, including Public Storage, Extra Space Storage Inc., and Life Storage, Inc.  These companies, some of which operate significantly more stores than we do and have greater resources than we have, and other entities may be able to accept more risk than we determine is prudent for us, including risks with respect to the geographic proximity of investments and the payment of higher acquisition prices.  This competition may reduce the number of suitable acquisition opportunities available to us, increase the price required to acquire stores, and reduce the demand for self-storage space at our stores.  Nevertheless, we believe that our experience in operating, managing, acquiring, developing, and obtaining financing for self-storage properties should enable us to compete effectively.
     Government Regulation
     We are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures and various federal, state, and local regulations that apply generally to the ownership of real property and the operation of self-storage properties.
     Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and applicable state accessibility act laws (collectively, the “ADA”), all places of public accommodation are required to meet federal requirements related to physical access and use by disabled persons.  A number of other federal, state, and local laws may also impose access and other similar requirements at our stores.  A failure to comply with the ADA or similar state or local requirements could result in the governmental imposition of fines or the award of damages to private litigants affected by the noncompliance.  Although we believe that our stores comply in all material respects with these requirements (or would be eligible for applicable exemptions from material requirements because of adaptive assistance provided), a determination that one or more of our stores or websites is not in compliance with the ADA or similar state or local requirements would result in the incurrence of additional costs associated with bringing them into compliance.
     Under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released on or in its property.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances.  The presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, when released, may adversely affect the property owner’s 

 
  10

 
ability to sell the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral, and may cause the property owner to incur substantial remediation costs.  In addition to claims for cleanup costs, the presence of hazardous substances on a property could result in a claim by a private party for personal injury or a claim by an adjacent property owner or user for property damage.  We may also become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances stored at the properties by a customer even though storage of hazardous substances would be without our knowledge or approval and in violation of the customer’s storage lease agreement with us.
     Our practice is to conduct or obtain environmental assessments in connection with the acquisition or development of properties.  Whenever the environmental assessment for one of our stores indicates that a store is impacted by soil or groundwater contamination from prior owners/operators or other sources, we work with our environmental consultants and, where appropriate, state governmental agencies, to ensure that the store is either cleaned up, that no cleanup is necessary because the low level of contamination poses no significant risk to public health or the environment, or that the responsibility for cleanup rests with a third party.  In certain cases, we have purchased environmental liability insurance coverage to indemnify us against claims for contamination or other adverse environmental conditions that may affect a property.
     We are not aware of any environmental cleanup liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on us.  We cannot provide assurance, however, that these environmental assessments and investigations have revealed or will reveal all potential environmental liabilities, that no prior owner created any material environmental condition not known to us or the independent consultant or that future events or changes in environmental laws will not result in the imposition of environmental liability on us.
     We have not received notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, claim, or liability in connection with any of our stores, nor have we been notified of a claim for personal injury or property damage by a private party in connection with any of our stores relating to environmental conditions.
     We are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our stores that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and we do not expect that the cost of compliance with environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  We cannot provide assurance, however, that this will continue to be the case.
     Insurance
     We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio.  We carry environmental insurance coverage on certain stores in our portfolio.  We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage, and industry practice.  We do not carry insurance for losses such as loss from riots, war or acts of God, and, in some cases, flood and environmental hazards, because such coverage is either not available or not available at commercially reasonable rates.  Some of our policies, such as those covering losses due to terrorist activities, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes, are insured subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover losses.  We also carry liability insurance to insure against personal injuries that might be sustained at our stores as well as director and officer liability insurance.     Offices
     Our principal executive offices are located at 5 Old Lancaster Road, Malvern, PA 19355.  Our telephone number is (610) 535-5000.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, we employed 2,815 employees, of whom 330 were corporate executive and administrative personnel and 2,485 were property-level personnel.  We believe that our relations with our employees are good.  Our employees are not unionized.     Available Information
