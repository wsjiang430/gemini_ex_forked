Data Intelligence Platform
 
Our data intelligence platform provides precise data and insights on consumer’s real-world behavior and trends for use in marketing and research. Our data intelligence platform technology allows for the ingestion and normalization of various data sources, such as location data, transactional data, contextual data, and search data to reach the right target audience with the right message. Utilizing massively parallel cluster computing and machine learning algorithms and technology, our data intelligence solutions make available actionable data for marketers, researchers and application publishers through an automated platform. We are seeking to generate several revenue streams from our data collection and analysis, including, among other things; advertising, data licensing, and custom research.

We also offer a self-service alternative through our MobiExchange product, which is a SaaS fee model. MobiExchange is a data focused technology solution that enables individuals and companies to rapidly build actionable data and insights for their own use. MobiExchange’s easy-to-use, self-service tools allow users to reduce the complex technical and financial barriers typically associated with turning offline data, and other business data, into actionable digital products and services. MobiExchange provides out-of-the-box private labeling, flexible branding, content management, user management, user communications, subscriptions, payment, invoices, reporting, gateways to third party platforms, and help desk among other things.
 
Our data intelligence platform is hosted and managed on Amazon Web Service (AWS) and takes full advantage of open standards for processing, storage, security and big data technology. Specifically, our data intelligence platform uses the following AWS services: EC2, Lambda, Kafka, Kinesis, S3, Storm, Spark, Machine Learning, RDS, Redshift, Elastic Map Reduction, CloudWatch, DataBricks, and Elastic Search Service with built-in Kibana integration.
 
Publisher Platform for Monetization and Compliance
 
Our Content publisher platform is a single-vendor ad tech operating system that allows publishers to better monetize their opt-in user data and advertising inventory. The platform includes tools for: consent management, audience building, a direct advertising interface and inventory enhancement. Due to the much publicized developments in privacy and data security laws and regulations (such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 or CCPA by way of example) along with Apple and Google’s removal of identifiers, we believe that content publishers are facing two material issues: increased costs due to privacy compliance rules, and decreased revenue due to the restrictions selling user identifier data to third parties. We believe this is causing a paradigm shift in the publishing market. Previously content publishers could provide user identifier information to demand-side platforms (or DSP’s) to create user profiles for audience targeting. Now both the user identifier data and the functionality to create profiled data segments from that identifier data (known as first party data) must be owned by the content publisher. Additionally, publishers must also manage the targeting of their audiences in-house utilizing these identifier and targeting data. We recently launched our SaaS publisher platform in response to these needs.
 
All Publisher data is siloed and secured, using the highest industry standards, optimizing compliance with privacy and data laws that may be applicable. Our platform helps publishers worry less about the integrity of their first party data and allows them to focus on effectively monetizing their inventory.
 
Users of the publisher platform get access to benefits of our publisher platform, including among other things:
 

· | A Consent Manager for publishers to meet all privacy requirements in connection with their collection of an audience’s data.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | An Audience Builder to build detailed databases of targeted audiences from the user identifier data. 
· | A Direct Purchase Interface to increase revenue from direct advertising sales to target audiences; and 
· | An Inventory Enhancer to enhance the publisher’s supply of audience data with compliant meta-tags.

We believe that irrespective of whether a publisher chooses to engage with us to use our publisher platform or not, they will need to find a solution that allows advertisers to advertise to the publisher’s audience directly through the publisher.

Our Strategy
 
Our strategy in the advertising technology space is to provide enterprises with three proprietary solutions that are highly efficient and effective for monetization of data and advertising with privacy and data regulatory compliance. We believe that our platforms give users in these markets the capability of running programmatic campaigns without the need for an extensive marketing team, which enables them to better compete with their larger competitors who have greater marketing financial and human capital resources. Our sales and marketing approach is focused on providing a de-fragmented operating system that facilitates a considerably more efficient and effective way for advertisers and publishers to transact with each other. Mobiquity plans to hire several new sales and sales support individuals to help generate additional revenue through the use of our three platforms.
 
Our strategy is based on problems we perceived in the advertising technology industry as it has rapidly grown over the last few years and the evolving privacy and data laws and regulations that make it more difficult to achieve desired results. Our goal is to help our clients increase revenue, decrease cost and add transparency while complying with privacy and data laws.
 
Our Revenue Sources
 
We target publishers, brands, advertising agencies and other advertising technology companies as our audience for our three platform products. We generate revenue from our platforms through two verticals:

· | The first is licensing one or more of our platforms as a white-label product for use by advertising agencies, demand-side platforms (or DSP’s), brands and publishers. Under the white-label scenario, the user licenses a platform from us and is responsible for running its own business operations and is billed a percentage of amounts spent on advertising run through the platform.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The second revenue stream is a managed services model, in which, the user is billed a higher percentage of revenue run through a platform, but all services are managed by us. 

Our Intellectual Property
 
Our portfolio of technology consists of various intellectual property including proprietary source code, trade secrets and know-how that we have developed internally. We own our technology, although we use open-source software for certain aspects, and we protect it though trade secrets and confidentiality requirements set out in our employee handbook which each employee acknowledges, and assigning any technology creations and improvements to us. We also have two patents that relate to our location-based mobile advertising technology business which we are not operating. These patents and patents pending are not material to, or used in, our platform related technology that we use in our current operations.
Governmental Regulations
 
Federal, state, and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we collect. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, self-regulatory requirements, and legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, including those relating to the use of data for marketing purposes. As we develop and provide solutions that address new market segments, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs or restrict our operations. From time to time, we may be notified of or otherwise become aware of additional laws and regulations that governmental organizations or others may claim should be applicable to our business. Our failure to anticipate the application of these laws and regulations accurately, or other failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity or cause us to alter our business practices, which could cause our net revenues to decrease, our costs to increase or our business otherwise to be harmed. See “Item 1A.”

We are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet, e-commerce, and m-commerce in a number of jurisdictions around the world. Existing and future regulations and laws could impede the growth of the Internet, e-commerce, m-commerce, or other online services. These regulations and laws may involve taxation, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, data protection, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts, electronic communications, and consumer protection. It is not clear how existing laws and regulations governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet as the vast majority of these laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet, e-commerce or m-commerce. It is possible that general business regulations and laws, or those specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce or m-commerce may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. See “Risk Factors—Our business practices with respect to data and consumer protection could give rise to liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy, data protection and consumer protection”; and “Risk Factors-- Changes in consumer sentiment or laws, rules or regulations regarding tracking technologies and other privacy matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate net revenues and could adversely affect our ability to collect data on consumer shopping behavior.”
 
Competition
 
We compete in the programmatic advertising, data management, and user compliance management industries and in all other facets of our business against small, medium and large companies throughout the United States. Some examples include companies such as Liveramp, The TradeDesk and OneTrust. Although we can give no assurance that our business will be able to compete against other companies with greater experience and resources, we believe we have a competitive advantage with our proprietary software and technology platform based on our view that our competitor’s products do not provide the end-to-end solutions that our product solutions do, and their minimum fees are substantially higher than ours for a comparative suite of solutions. See “Risk Factors — We face intense and growing competition, which could result in reduced sales and reduced operating margins and limit our market share.”
Employees and Contractors
 
As of December 31, 2022, we have 14 employees, including executive management, technical personnel, salespeople, and support staff employees. We also utilize several additional firms/persons who provide services to us on a non-exclusive basis as independent consultants.
Customers
 
For fiscal 2022 and 2021, sales of our products to two customers generated approximately 48% and 31% of our revenues, respectively. Our contracts with our customers generally do not obligate them to a specified term and they can generally terminate their relationship with us at any time with a minimal amount of notice.
