Overview of Our Business
 
Our mission is to become a nationwide leader in providing out-of-home advertising in China, primarily serving the needs of branded corporate customers. Our business direction to not just selling air-time for its media panels but also started working closely with property developers in media planning for the property at the very early stage. As a media planner we share the advertising profits with the property developers without paying significant rights fees, so we expect to achieve a positive return from these projects.
History
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 10, 1993, under the name EC Capital Limited. Our predecessor companies were involved in a variety of businesses and were operated by various management teams under different operating names. Between 2004 and 2006 we operated under the name Teda Travel Group Inc., which was primarily engaged in the provision of management services to hotels and resorts in China. On August 1, 2006, we changed our name to “Network CN Inc.” in order to better reflect our new vision to build a nationwide information and entertainment network in China.

Industry Overview
 
The world economy continued to struggle through uncertainty about the European sovereign debt crisis and the strength of the economic recovery in the United States which, in turn, hampered global economic revival since 2013. The unfavorable global and domestic climate created a number of challenges to China’s advertising industry as budget conservatism prevailed among advertisers throughout the period. Most advertisers are cost-conscious and prefer to commit to short-term rather than long-term contracts. Current or potential advertisers may be unable to fund advertising purchases or determine to reduce purchases, all of which would lead to reduced demand for our advertising services, reduced gross margins, and increased delays of payments of accounts receivable or defaults of payments. We are also limited in our ability to reduce costs to offset the results of a prolonged or severe economic downturn given our fixed media costs associated with our operations. Competition in the domestic out-of-home advertising sector is very intense and many local operators offer significant sales discounts to compete for market share.
 
With the economic slowdown, as expected, China’s advertising market also followed in step and realized slow but smooth growth.
 
In the past, we expended our resources to build an out-of-home media throughout different PRC cities. We believe that in order to increase our market share in out-of-home advertising in China we will have to increase our advertising locations, obtain more exclusive arrangements in desirable and prominent locations and to provide a wider range of media and advertising services through entering business agreements or business combination exercises with third parties.
 
Our Services
 
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not provide any services.
 
Our Suppliers
 
In some of our current and past media projects, we are responsible for installing advertising panels and billboards. We design the shape of our advertising panels and billboards according to the terms approved in the relevant PRC governmental documents. We identify suppliers of component parts used in our advertising panels and contract assembly of our advertising panels to third-party contract assemblers who assemble our advertising panels according to our specification. We select component suppliers based on price and quality. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not install any advertising panels and billboards and no rights contracts were signed in 2018 and 2017.
Our Customers
 
Our customers include large international and domestic brand name customers. Our operations were negatively affected by a variety of factors including slower economic growth in PRC, slower than expected consumer acceptance of the digital form of advertising media and customers continued to be cost-conscious in their advertising budget. To address these unfavorable market conditions, we implement cost-cutting measures with reductions in our workforce in particular the direct sales force. The reduced selling power and strong competition from other media companies resulted in the Company having no customer for 2018 and 2017.
Sales and Marketing
 
We sell our services through our direct sales force as well as through domestic advertising agencies. We employ sales professionals in the PRC and provide them in-house training to ensure we operate closely with and provide a high level of support to our customers. Selling through domestic advertising agencies enables us to leverage our direct sales resources and reach additional customers.

Competition
 
We compete with other advertising companies in China, including companies that operate out-of-home advertising media networks, such as Vision China Media, Focus Media, Air Media and Clear Media. The Company competes with these companies for advertising clients on the basis of the size of our advertising network, advertising coverage, panel locations, pricing, and range of advertising services that we offer. The Company also competes with these companies for rights to locate advertising panels and/or billboards in desirable locations in Chinese cities. In addition, commercial buildings, hotels, restaurants and other commercial locations may decide to install and operate their own billboards or LED panels. The Company also competes for overall advertising spending with other more traditional media such as newspapers, TV, magazines and radio, and more advanced media like internet advertising, frame and public transport.
 
The Company may also face competition from new entrants into the out-of-home advertising sector. Our sector is characterized by low initial fixed costs for entrance in term of advertising panel requirements and it is uncommon for advertising clients to enter into exclusive arrangements. Additionally, wholly foreign-owned advertising companies are allowed to operate in China, which may expose us to increasing competition from international advertising media companies attracted by the opportunities in China.
 
Increased competition could reduce our operating margins, profitability and result in a loss of market share. Some of our existing and potential competitors may have competitive advantages, such as more advertising locations and broader coverage and exclusive arrangements in desirable locations. These competitors could provide advertising clients with a wider range of media and advertising services, which could cause us to lose advertising clients or to reduce prices in order to compete, which could decrease our revenues, gross margins and profits. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete against these existing and new competitors.
 
In addition, our business has been adversely affected by the global financial turmoil which began in late 2008. In order to enhance our competitive power, we will strictly control our operating costs and actively search for other prominent advertising projects in order to expand our advertising network. We believe that expanding our advertising network will enable us to offer more competitive pricing to our advertising clients, thereby increasing our profitability.
 
Our Intellectual Property
 
As of March 29, 2019, we do not have any registered trademarks, copyrights, licenses or patent rights. 
 
Our Research and Development
 
No material costs have been incurred on research and development activities for the fiscal years 2018 and 2017. We do not expect to incur significant research and development costs in the coming future.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries and variable interest entities had approximately 3 employees at our office located at Hong Kong, all of which are full-time employees.
 
Our employees are not represented by a labor organization or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees and we have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppage or any difficulty in recruiting staff for our operations.
 
We are required under PRC law to make contributions to employee benefit plans at specified percentages of the after-tax profit. In addition, we are required by the PRC law to cover our employees in China with various type of social insurance. We believe that we are in material compliance with the relevant PRC laws.

Business Licenses for Advertising Companies
 
The principal regulations governing the advertising businesses in China include:
 

l | The Advertising Law (1994);
--+----------------------------


l | Regulations on Control of Advertisement (1987); and
--+----------------------------------------------------


l | The Implementing Rules for the Advertising Administrative Regulations (2004).

These regulations stipulate that companies that engage in advertising activities must obtain from the SAIC or its local branches a business license which specifically includes operating an advertising business within its business scope. Companies conducting advertising activities without such a license may be subject to penalties, including fines, confiscation of advertising income and orders to cease advertising operations. The business license of an advertising company is valid for the duration of its existence, unless the license is suspended or revoked due to a violation of any relevant law or regulation.
 
We do not expect to encounter any difficulties in maintaining our business licenses. Our PRC advertising operating companies hold business license from the local branches of the SAIC as required by the existing PRC regulations.
 
Advertising Content
 
PRC advertising laws and regulations set forth certain content requirements for advertisements in China, which include prohibitions on, among other things, misleading content, superlative wording, socially destabilizing content or content involving obscenities, superstition, violence, discrimination or infringement of the public interest. Advertisements for anesthetic, psychotropic, toxic or radioactive drugs are prohibited. It is prohibited to disseminate tobacco advertisements via broadcast or print media. It is also prohibited to display tobacco advertisements in any waiting lounge, theater, cinema, conference hall, stadium or other public area. There are also specific restrictions and requirements regarding advertisements that relate to matters such as patented products or processes, pharmaceuticals, medical instruments, veterinary pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, foodstuffs, alcohol and cosmetics. In addition, all advertisements relating to pharmaceuticals, medical instruments, agrochemicals and veterinary pharmaceuticals advertised through radio, film, television, newspaper, magazine and other forms of media, together with any other advertisements which are subject to censorship by administrative authorities according to relevant laws and administrative regulations, must be submitted to the relevant administrative authorities for content approval prior to dissemination.
 
Advertisers, advertising operators and advertising distributors are required by PRC advertising laws and regulations to ensure that the content of the advertisements they prepare or distribute are true and in full compliance with applicable laws. In providing advertising services, advertising operators and advertising distributors must review the prescribed supporting documents provided by advertisers for advertisements and verify that the content of the advertisements comply with applicable PRC laws and regulations. In addition, prior to distributing advertisements for certain commodities, which are subject to government censorship and approval, advertising distributors and advertisers are obligated to ensure that such censorship has been performed and approval has been obtained. Violation of these regulations may result in penalties, including fines, confiscation of advertising income, orders to cease dissemination of the advertisements and orders to publish an advertisement correcting the misleading information. In circumstances involving serious violations, the SAIC or its local branches may revoke violators’ licenses or permits for advertising business operations. Furthermore, advertisers, advertising operators or advertising distributors may be subject to civil liability if they infringe on the legal rights and interests of third parties in the course of their advertising business. We have implemented procedures to ensure the content of our advertisement are properly reviewed and the advertisement would only be published upon the receipt of content approval from the relevant administrative authorities. However, we provide no assurance that all the content of the advertisement are true and in full compliance with applicable laws.
 
Out-of-home Advertising
 
The Advertising Law stipulates that the exhibition and display of out-of-home advertisements must not:
 

l | utilize traffic safety facilities and traffic signs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


l | impede the use of public facilities, traffic safety facilities and traffic signs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


l | obstruct commercial and public activities or create an eyesore in urban areas;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


l | be placed in restrictive areas near government offices, cultural landmarks or historical or scenic sites; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


l | be placed in areas prohibited by the local governments from having out-of-home advertisements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In additional to the Advertising Law, the SAIC promulgated the Out-of-home Advertising Registration Administrative Regulations on December 8, 1995, as amended on December 3, 1998, and May 22, 2006, which governs the out-of-home advertising industry in China.
 
Out-of-home advertisements in China must be registered with the local SAIC before dissemination. The advertising distributors are required to submit a registration application form and other supporting documents for registration. After review and examination, if an application complies with the requirements, the local SAIC will issue an Out-of-home Advertising Registration Certificate for such advertisement. Many municipal cities of China have respectively promulgated their own local regulations on the administration of out-of-home advertisements. Those municipal regulations set forth specific requirements on the out-of-home advertisements, such as the allowed places of dissemination and size requirements of the out-of-home advertisement facilities.
 
In addition to the regulations on out-of-home advertisements, the placement and installation of LED billboards are also subject to municipal local zoning requirements and relevant governmental approvals of the city where the LED billboards located. In Shanghai, prior to the placement and installation of LED billboards, installers are required to apply for an out-of-home advertising registration certificate for each LED billboard subject to a term of use approved by local government agency for each LED billboard. If the existing LED billboards placed by our LED location provider or us are required to be removed, the attractiveness of this portion of our advertising network will be diminished.

Foreign Currency Exchange
 
The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in China is the Rules on Foreign Exchange Control (1996), as amended. Under these rules, Renminbi is freely convertible for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for direct investment, loan or investment outside China without the prior approval of the State Administration for Foreign Exchange of the PRC or other relevant authorities is obtained.
 
Pursuant to the Rules on Foreign Exchange Control, foreign investment enterprises in China may purchase foreign currency without the approval of the State Administration for Foreign Exchange of the PRC for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions by providing commercial documents evidencing these transactions. They may also exchange Renminbi into foreign currencies (subject to a cap approved by the State Administration for Foreign Exchange of the PRC) to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate the ability of foreign investment enterprises to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future. In addition, foreign exchange transactions for direct investment, loan and investment outside China are still subject to limitations and require approvals from the State Administration for Foreign Exchange of the PRC.
 
Dividend Distributions
 
The principal regulations governing distribution of dividends of wholly foreign-owned companies include:
 

l | the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (1986), as amended; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


l | Administrative Rules under the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (2001).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Under these regulations, foreign investment enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, wholly foreign-owned enterprises in China are required to set aside at least 10% of their after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds, until such reserve funds have reached 50% of the enterprise’s registered capital. These reserves are restricted and not distributable as cash dividends.
 
We have not received any dividends or fees from our PRC subsidiaries or affiliated Chinese entities in the past three years. As all our PRC subsidiaries are currently still operating at a net loss, we are unable to estimate the time to receive dividends or other fees.
 
Enterprise Income Tax Law
 
The Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law, was promulgated by the PRC’s National People’s Congress on March 16, 2007 to introduce a new uniform taxation regime in the PRC. Both resident and non-resident enterprises deriving income from the PRC were subject to the EIT Law from January 1, 2008. It applies a single income tax rate to all enterprises in the PRC. Under this EIT Law, enterprises that qualify as “new and high technology enterprises” (“high-tech companies”) are entitled to a preferential tax rate of 15% and in other very limited situation entities may be subject to a EIT rate of 20%, but the general EIT rate is 25%.
 
We believe that each of our PRC operating entities were resident enterprises and subject to the enterprise income tax rate of 25% for their global income. We do not believe that any of our off-shore entities are resident enterprises as our off-shore entities didn’t provide any services in the PRC and their management and controls are all located outside China; permanent establishment does not exist and hence they would not fall into the resident enterprise category. However, we cannot provide assurance that all our offshore operating entities are not “resident enterprises” as there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and implementation of current PRC tax rule and regulation.
 
Environmental Matters
 
The Company's operations are subject to various environmental regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and that our compliance will have no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
