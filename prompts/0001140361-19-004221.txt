ITEM 1.  Business


NBT Bancorp Inc. (the “Registrant” or the “Company”) is a registered financial holding company incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1986, with its principal headquarters located in Norwich, New York. The Company, on a consolidated basis, at December 31, 2018 had assets of $9.6 billion and stockholders’ equity of $1.0 billion.
 
The principal assets of the Registrant consist of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of its subsidiaries, including NBT Bank, National Association (the “Bank”), NBT Financial Services, Inc. (“NBT Financial”), NBT Holdings, Inc. (“NBT Holdings”), CNBF Capital Trust I, NBT Statutory Trust I, NBT Statutory Trust II, Alliance Financial Capital Trust I and Alliance Financial Capital Trust II (collectively, the “Trusts”). The Company’s principal sources of revenue are the management fees and dividends it receives from the Bank, NBT Financial and NBT Holdings.
 
The Company’s business, primarily conducted through the Bank, consists of providing commercial banking, retail banking and wealth management services primarily to customers in its market area, which includes central and upstate New York, northeastern Pennsylvania, southern New Hampshire, western Massachusetts, Vermont and the southern coastal Maine area. The Company has been, and intends to continue to be, a community-oriented financial institution offering a variety of financial services. The Company’s business philosophy is to operate as a community bank with local decision-making, providing a broad array of banking and financial services to retail, commercial and municipal customers. The financial condition and operating results of the Company are dependent on its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest and dividend income earned on its earning assets, primarily loans and investments and the interest expense paid on its interest bearing liabilities, primarily consisting of deposits and borrowings. Among other factors, net income is also affected by provisions for loan losses and noninterest income, such as service charges on deposit accounts, insurance and other financial services revenue, trust revenue and gains/losses on securities sales, bank owned life insurance income, ATM and debit card fees and retirement plan administration fees, as well as noninterest expense, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment, data processing and communications, professional fees and outside services, office supplies and postage, amortization of intangible assets, loan collection and other real estate owned ("OREO") expenses, advertising, FDIC expenses and other expenses.
 
Some of the market areas that the Company serves are experiencing economic challenges and volatility. A variety of factors (e.g., any substantial rise in inflation or rise in unemployment rates, decrease in consumer confidence, adverse international economic conditions, natural disasters, war or political instability) may adversely affect both the Company’s markets and the national market. The Company will continue to emphasize effectively managing its funding costs and lending and investment rates to maintain profitability. In addition, the Company will continue to seek and maintain relationships that can generate noninterest income. We anticipate that this approach should help mitigate profit fluctuations that are caused by movements in interest rates, business and consumer loan cycles and local economic factors.

In connection with the acquisition of Alliance Financial Corporation (“Alliance”), the Company acquired two statutory trusts, Alliance Financial Capital Trust I and Alliance Financial Capital Trust II, which were formed in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

Competition
 
The financial services industry, including commercial banking, is highly competitive and we encounter strong competition for deposits, loans and other financial products and services in our market area. The increasingly competitive environment is the result of the continued low rate environment, changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, additional financial service providers and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers. The Company competes for loans, deposits and customers with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, money market funds, credit unions and other nonbank financial service providers.
 
The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems.
 
Some of the Company’s nonbanking competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have assets, capital and lending limits greater than that of the Company, have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader range of products and services than the Company. These institutions may have the ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns and may be able to offer lower rates on loans and higher rates on deposits than the Company can offer. Some of these institutions offer services, such as credit cards and international banking, which the Company does not directly offer.
 
Various in-state market competitors and out-of-state banks continue to enter or have announced plans to enter or expand their presence in the market areas in which the Company currently operates. With the addition of new banking presences within our market, the Company expects increased competition for loans, deposits and other financial products and services.
 
In order to compete with other financial services providers, the Company stresses the community nature of its banking operations and principally relies upon local promotional activities, personal relationships established by officers, directors and employees with the Company's customers and specialized services tailored to meet the needs of the communities served. We also offer certain customer services, such as agricultural lending, that many of our larger competitors do not offer. While the Company’s position varies by market, the Company’s management believes that it can compete effectively as a result of local market knowledge, local decision making and awareness of customer needs.

Data Privacy and Security Practices
 
The Company’s enterprise security strategy revolves around people, processes and technology. The Company employs a defense in depth strategy, which combines physical control measures with logical control measures and uses a layered security model to provide end-to-end security of Company and client information. The high-level objective of the information security program is to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all information assets in our environment. We accomplish this by building our program around six foundational control areas: program oversight and governance, safeguards and controls, security awareness training, service provider oversight, incident response and business continuity. The Company’s data security and privacy practices are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 2001 and applicable privacy laws described under the heading Supervision and Regulation in this Item 1. Business section.

 The controls identified in our enterprise security program are managed by various stakeholders throughout the Company and monitored by the information security team. All employees are required to complete information security and privacy training when they join the Company and then complete annual online training certification and ad hoc face to face trainings. The Company engages outside consultants to perform periodic audits of our information and data security controls and processes including penetration testing of the Company’s public facing websites and corporate networks. The Board of Directors requires the Company's Information Security Officer to report to them the status of the overall information security and data privacy program on a recurring basis.More information can be located on the Company’s website https://www.nbtbank.com/Personal/Customer-Support/Fraud-Information-Center.
 
Investment in Human Capital
 
The Company’s strategic initiative regarding investing in human capital includes key initiatives to attract, develop and retain our valued employees. Talent management continues to be a top priority as specific competencies are predicted to be in short-supply with the transition of retirement age skill sets.
 
To aid in retention and attract talent, the Company took advantage of the additional funds resulting from the lower corporate tax rate provided by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to increase the Company's minimum hiring pay rate to $15 per hour and provided a 5% pay increase to the remaining employees earning $50,000 and under annually. As a result, we have experienced even higher levels of employee retention rates, which results in greater customer satisfaction and continuity. The Company’s incentive programs recognize all full-time employees at all levels and are designed to motivate employees to support achievement of company success, with appropriate risk assessment and prevention measures designed to prevent fraud.
 
Learning and Development
 
The Company focuses on the future by encouraging and promoting internal development. We have four distinct training and development programs that address and encourage development and foster retention. Our high-potential program is in its sixth cycle of leader development. Our emerging leaders program develops our up-and-coming next generation of leaders. Our management development program aims at attracting key external talent, particularly through benefit programs such as financial education, tuition repayment, graduate school tuition assistance and flexible work arrangements. The management development program has placed many graduates in key positions where they have made significant contributions. Our professional development program provides an entry point for early career professionals. This program provides an overview of banking functions over a 12-18 month period, ultimately placing employees with working knowledge in positions of responsibility around the Company. In addition, employees have access to career paths throughout the Company’s business areas, supported by individual development plans and internal learning management system resources. To support this process, we named an internal career counselor to work as a liaison with employees and managers to direct their personal career aspirations.
Diversity and Inclusion
 
We have enhanced the visibility and structure of our long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion ("D&I"). Our Chief Diversity Officer has placed a high level of focus on relevant and impactful D&I initiatives by building upon our strong cultural foundation. In its second year of a three-year strategic roadmap, the Company has implemented a variety of initiatives from being transparent by posting our diversity values on our website to providing forums to listen more closely to what our employees want to say. The Company has a D&I steering committee comprised of members of the executive team, including the Chief Executive Officer. The plan is shared with our board of directors, management and employees, who are often included in implementing specific action items.
 
The Company developed a purpose statement to support the D&I initiative, which states that the Company strives to create an environment that is open and welcoming to all, leading to high employee engagement and job performance. We believe this will enable the Company to outperform its peers, ensure high levels of shareholder return and provide for financial independence. We strive to ensure our executives are demonstrating the highest ethical leadership, are approachable and inspire trust. More information can be located on the Company’s website at https://www.nbtbank.com/Personal/About-Us/Our-Bank/Diversity-and-Inclusion.
 
Conduct and Ethics
 
It is critical that the board of directors and senior management vigorously endorse a no-tolerance stance for workplace harassment, biases and unethical behavior. The Company’s values-based Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is extensively communicated on our website, intranet, company newsletter and internally socialized through a blog entitled “Respectfully Yours.” Frequent training specific to managers and employees, regular publication of our whistleblower policy and reporting mechanisms provide framework to the Company’s motto of: “The right people. Doing the right things. In the right way.”

 Engaging Employees
 
The Company seeks to further refine its workforce programs through its employee engagement survey, which had a 90% participation rate in 2018. Based on the most recent survey, high impact strengths included leadership, alignment to company goals and individual work, sense of team and identity, autonomy to get things done, access to learning and development and social responsibility. The executive team owns several initiatives directly tied to the survey feedback, including the employee forums mentioned above. With technology and the implementation of Office 365, we have increased interactions among team members across our geography. The Company believes that engaged employees will drive retention and effort, ultimately correlating to a better experience for our customers.
Supervision and Regulation
 
The Company, the Bank and certain of its non-banking subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws. The regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks is intended to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the stability of the U.S. banking system. This system is not designed to protect equity investors in bank holding companies, such as the Company.
 
Set forth below is a summary of the significant laws and regulations applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. The description that follows is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described. Such statutes, regulations and policies are subject to ongoing review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in any of the statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the results of the Company.
 
Environmental
 
The Company is focused on the environment and committed to business practices and activities that encourage sustainability and minimize our environmental impact. In larger facilities, the Company conserves energy through the use of building energy management systems and motion sensor lighting controls. In new construction and renovations, the Company incorporates high-efficiency mechanical equipment, LED lighting, and modern building techniques to reduce our carbon footprint wherever possible.  The Company has an ongoing initiative to replace existing lighting with LED lighting to reduce energy consumption.
 
Through our solar financing partnership, the Company offers homeowners across the country the opportunity to power their homes with a sustainable energy source. Services like mobile and online banking, remote deposit capture, eStatements and combined statements enable us to support all customers in their efforts to consume less fuel and paper. We continue to digitize loan origination processes, reducing trips to the bank and paper documents for our customers. Across our footprint, we host community shred days with multiple confidential document destruction companies to promote safe document disposal and recycling.
 
Overview
 
The Company is a registered bank holding company and financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”) and is subject to the supervision of and regular examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board” or “FRB”) as its primary federal regulator. The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and is subject to the disclosure and other regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as administered by the SEC. The Company's common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select market under the ticker symbol, “NBTB,” and the Company is subject to the NASDAQ stock market rules.
 
The Bank is chartered as a national banking association under the National Bank Act. The Bank is subject to the supervision of, and to regular examination by, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) as its chartering authority and primary federal regulator. The Bank is also subject to the supervision and regulation, to a limited extent, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as its deposit insurer. Financial products and services offered by the Company and the Bank are subject to federal consumer protection laws and implementing regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The Company and the Bank are also subject to oversight by state attorneys general for compliance with state consumer protection laws. The Bank's deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable deposit insurance limits in accordance with FDIC laws and regulations. The non-bank subsidiaries of the Company and the Bank are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, including regulations of the FRB and the OCC, respectively.
     Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), U.S. banks and financial services firms have been subject to enhanced regulation and oversight. Over the past year, the current administration and its appointees to the federal banking agencies have enacted legislation and taken other steps to modify and scale back portions of the Dodd-Frank Act and certain of its implementing regulations. It is not clear whether any additional such legislation or regulatory changes will be enacted or implemented or, if enacted or implemented, what the effect on the Company would be, though major changes are not expected in the near term.

 Federal Bank Holding Company Regulation
 
The Company is a bank holding company as defined by the BHC Act. The BHC Act generally limits the business of the Company to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking “as to be a proper incident thereto.” The Company has also qualified for and elected to be a financial holding company. Financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the FRB in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury), or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system (as solely determined by the FRB). If a bank holding company seeks to engage in the broader range of activities permitted under the BHC Act for financial holding companies, (i) the bank holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be “well-capitalized” and “well-managed,” as defined in the FRB's Regulation Y and (ii) it must file a declaration with the FRB that it elects to be a “financial holding company.” In order for a financial holding company to commence any activity that is financial in nature, incidental thereto, or complementary to a financial activity, or to acquire a company engaged in any such activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”). See the section titled “Community Reinvestment Act of 1977” for further information relating to the CRA.
 
Regulation of Mergers and Acquisitions
 
The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of depository institutions and their holding companies. The BHC Act requires prior FRB approval for a bank holding company to acquire, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a commercial bank or its parent holding company and for a company, other than a bank holding company, to acquire 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company (and sometimes a lower percentage if there are other indications of control). Under the Change in Bank Control Act, any person, including a company, may not acquire, directly or indirectly, control of a bank without providing 60 days’ prior notice and receiving a non-objection from the appropriate federal banking agency.
 
Under the Bank Merger Act, prior approval of the OCC is required for a national bank to merge with another bank where the national bank is the surviving bank or to purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the federal banking agencies will consider, among other criteria, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined banking organization, the applicant's performance record under the CRA and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities.
 
As a financial holding company, the Company is permitted to acquire control of non-depository institutions engaged in activities that are financial in nature and in activities that are incidental to financial activities without prior FRB approval. However, the BHC Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, requires prior written approval from the FRB or prior written notice to the FRB before a financial holding company may acquire control of a company with consolidated assets of $10 billion or more.
 
Capital Distributions
 
The principal source of the Company's liquidity is dividends from the Bank. The OCC oversees the ability of the Bank to make capital distributions, including dividends. The OCC generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the bank would thereafter be undercapitalized. The OCC’s prior approval is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the bank's net income for that year and its undistributed net income for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. The National Bank Act also prohibits national banks from paying dividends that would be greater than the bank's undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the bank's allowance for loan losses.
 
The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank's capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. The appropriate federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine, based on the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit such payment.
 
Affiliate and Insider Transactions
 
Transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, including the Company, are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (the “FRA”) and the FRB’s implementing Regulation W. An “affiliate” of a bank includes any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such bank. In a bank holding company context, at a minimum, the parent holding company of a bank and companies that are controlled by such parent holding company, are affiliates of the bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA are intended to protect insured depository institutions from losses in transactions with affiliates. These sections place quantitative and qualitative limitations on covered transactions between the Bank and its affiliates and require that all transactions between a bank and its affiliates occur on market terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
 
 9
 
 Section 22(h) of the FRA and its implementing Regulation O restricts loans to the Bank's and its affiliates' directors, executive officers and principal stockholders (“Insiders”). Under Section 22(h), loans to Insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the Bank's total capital and surplus. Loans to Insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the Bank’s board of directors. Further, under Section 22(h) of the FRA, loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, except that such Insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the Bank’s employees and does not give preference to the Insider over the employees. Section 22(g) of the FRA places additional limitations on loans to the Bank's and its affiliates' executive officers.
 
Federal Deposit Insurance and Brokered Deposits
 
The FDIC’s deposit insurance limit is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category, in accordance with applicable FDIC regulations. The Bank’s deposit accounts are fully insured by the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) up to the deposit insurance limits in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
 
The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank's capital level and supervisory rating (“CAMELS rating”). The risk matrix uses different risk categories distinguished by capital levels and supervisory ratings. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the base for deposit insurance assessments is the consolidated average assets less average tangible equity. Assessment rates are calculated using formulas that take into account the risk of the institution being assessed. In addition to deposit insurance assessments, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) provides for additional assessments related to outstanding bonds issued by The Financing Corporation ("FICO"). The FICO is a mixed-ownership government corporation established by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 whose sole purpose was to function as a financing vehicle for the now defunct Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Company. The FICO assessments are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment base of the DIF and do not vary depending upon a depository institution’s capitalization or supervisory evaluation. Outstanding FICO bonds mature through 2019.
 
Under FDIC laws and regulations, no FDIC-insured depository institution can accept brokered deposits unless it is well-capitalized or unless it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. Applicable laws and regulations also prohibit any depository institution that is not well-capitalized from paying an interest rate on brokered deposits in excess of three-quarters of one percentage point over certain prevailing market rates.
 
Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Bank's management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to the termination of its deposit insurance.
 
Federal Home Loan Bank System
 
The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of New York, which provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions for home mortgage and neighborhood lending. The Bank is subject to the rules and requirements of the FHLB, including the requirement to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in an amount at least equal to the sum of 0.125% of mortgage related assets loans at the beginning of each year. The Bank was in compliance with FHLB rules and requirements as of December 31, 2018.
Debit Card Interchange Fees
 
The Dodd-Frank Act requires that any interchange transaction fee charged for a debit transaction be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction. FRB regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act limit interchange fees on debit cards to a maximum of 21 cents per transaction plus 5 basis points of the transaction amount. The rule also permits a fraud-prevention adjustment of 1 cent per transaction conditioned upon an issuer developing, implementing and updating reasonably designed fraud-prevention policies and procedures. Issuers that, together with their affiliates, have less than $10 billion of assets, such as the Company, are exempt from the debit card interchange fee standards. However, FRB regulations prohibit all issuers, including the Company and the Bank, from restricting the number of networks over which electronic debit transactions may be processed to less than two unaffiliated networks.
Source of Strength Doctrine
 
FRB policy requires bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Act codifies the requirement that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions. A bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the FRB to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of FRB regulations or both. As a result, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loan by the Company to the Bank is subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides that, in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.

 In addition, under the National Bank Act, if the Bank’s capital stock is impaired by losses or otherwise, the OCC is authorized to require payment of the deficiency by assessment upon the Company. If the assessment is not paid within three months, the OCC could order a sale of Bank stock held by the Company to cover any deficiency.
 
Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action
 
In July 2013, the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC approved final rules (the “Capital Rules”) that established a new capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (the “Basel Committee”) December 2010 final capital framework referred to as “Basel III” for strengthening international capital standards. The Capital Rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios. The Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing general risk-weighting approach with a more risk-sensitive approach.
 
The Capital Rules: (i) require a capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”) and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. Under the Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, including the Company, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common forms of Tier 2 capital are subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan losses, in each case, subject to the Capital Rules’ specific requirements.
 
Pursuant to the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015 are:
 
  
● | 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;
--+-----------------------------------


● | 6.0% Tier 1 capital (CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 8.0% Total capital (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the “leverage ratio”).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The Capital Rules also require a “capital conservation buffer,” composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity and other capital instrument repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The capital conservation buffer was phased in incrementally until when, on January 1, 2019, the capital conservation buffer was fully phased in, resulting in the capital standards applicable to the Company and the Bank including an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, and effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5% and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. The risk-weighting categories in the Capital Rules are standardized and include a risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes.
 
The Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. The deductions and adjustments will be incrementally phased in between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2019.
 
In addition, under the prior general risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (“AOCI”) items included in stockholders’ equity (for example, marks-to-market of securities held in the available for sale ("AFS") portfolio) under GAAP were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded; however, banking organizations not using the advanced approaches, including the Company and the Bank, were permitted to make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items in January 2015. The Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010, from inclusion in bank holding companies’ Tier 1 capital.
 
 11
 
 Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and were phased in over a 4-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and increased by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reached 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
 
In September 2017, the federal banking agencies proposed simplifying the Capital Rules. The proposal would apply primarily to non-advanced approaches institutions, such as the Company. The proposal would simplify and clarify a number of the more complex aspects of the Capital Rules, including the treatment for certain acquisition, development and construction loans, mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interest. In November 2017, the FRB finalized a rule extending the currently applicable capital rules for mortgage servicing assets and certain other items for non-advanced approaches institutions. That rule is in effect pending the comment period and review of the general proposal to simplify the Capital Rules for non-advanced approaches institutions.
 
 In addition, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”), which was enacted in May 2018, required the federal banking agencies to promulgate rules establishing a new “community bank leverage ratio” for depository institutions and their holding companies with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as us. This change is intended to simplify regulatory capital requirements for institutions like us with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, which will have an option to calculate this leverage ratio, rather than multiple existing measures of capital adequacy. Such an institution would be considered to have met the capital ratio requirements to be well-capitalized if it has a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9%. The federal banking agencies issues proposed rules to implement this section of the EGRRCPA in November 2018. If we remain under the $10 billion threshold when these rules are finalized, we will evaluate whether to elect the option to calculate the community bank leverage ratio instead of multiple existing measures of capital adequacy.


Management believes that the Company is in compliance, with the targeted capital ratios.
 
Prompt Corrective Action and Safety and Soundness
 
Pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA, federal banking agencies are required to take “prompt corrective action” (“PCA”) should an insured depository institution fail to meet certain capital adequacy standards. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized, may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment.
 
For purposes of PCA, to be: (i) well-capitalized, an insured depository institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 8%, a CET1 risk based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%; (ii) adequately capitalized, an insured depository institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 6%, a CET1 risk based capital ratio of at least 4.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4%; (iii) undercapitalized, an insured depository institution would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of less than 6%, a CET1 risk based capital ratio of less than 4.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4%; (iv) significantly undercapitalized, an insured depository institution would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of less than 4%, a CET1 risk based capital ratio of less than 3%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3%.; (v) critically undercapitalized, an insured depository institution would have a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is less than or equal to 2%. At December 31, 2018, the Bank qualified as “well capitalized” under applicable regulatory capital standards.
 
Bank holding companies and insured depository institutions may also be subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business or for violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by the agency or term of a written agreement with the agency. In more serious cases, enforcement actions may include the issuance of directives to increase capital; the issuance of formal and informal agreements; the imposition of civil monetary penalties; the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers, directors and other institution−affiliated parties; the termination of the insured depository institution’s deposit insurance; the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the insured depository institution; and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the FDIC, as receiver, would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted.
 
Volcker Rule
 
 Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, restricts the ability of banking entities from: (i) engaging in “proprietary trading” and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain covered funds, subject to certain limited exceptions. Under the EGRRCPA, depository institutions and their holding companies with less than $10 billion in assets, like us, are excluded from the prohibitions of the Volcker Rule. Accordingly, we are no longer subject to the Volcker Rule, although if we grow to have more than $10 billion in assets, we will become subject to the Volcker Rule again. Given the Company's size and the scope of its activities, the implementation of the Volcker Rule did not have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements, and we expect this will remain true if the Company becomes subject to the Volcker Rule again in the future.

 12
 
 Depositor Preference
 
The FDIA provides that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
 
Consumer Protection and CFPB Supervision
 
The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the CFPB, an independent agency charged with responsibility for implementing, enforcing and examining compliance with federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB has examination authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. As the Company is below this threshold, the OCC continues to exercise primary examination authority over the Bank with regard to compliance with federal consumer financial laws and regulations. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, state attorneys general are empowered to enforce rules issued by the CFPB.
 
The Company is subject to federal consumer financial statutes and the regulations promulgated thereunder including, but not limited to:
 
  
● | the Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”), prohibiting discrimination in connection with the extension of credit;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (“HMDA”), requiring home mortgage lenders, including the Bank, to make available to the public expanded information regarding the pricing of home mortgage loans, including the “rate spread” between the annual percentage rate and the average prime offer rate for mortgage loans of a comparable type; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), governing the provision of consumer information to credit reporting agencies and the use of consumer information; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The Bank’s failure to comply with any of the consumer financial laws can result in civil actions, regulatory enforcement action by the federal banking agencies and the U.S. Department of Justice.
 
USA PATRIOT Act
 
The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), as amended by the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA PATRIOT Act”), imposes obligations on U.S. financial institutions, including banks and broker-dealer subsidiaries, to implement policies, procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Financial institutions also are required to respond to requests for information from federal banking agencies and law enforcement agencies. Information sharing among financial institutions for the above purposes is encouraged by an exemption granted to complying financial institutions from the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and other privacy laws. Financial institutions that hold correspondent accounts for foreign banks or provide private banking services to foreign individuals are required to take measures to avoid dealing with certain foreign individuals or entities, including foreign banks with profiles that raise money laundering concerns and are prohibited from dealing with foreign "shell banks" and persons from jurisdictions of particular concern. The primary federal banking agencies and the Secretary of the Treasury have adopted regulations to implement several of these provisions. Beginning on May 11, 2018, the Bank is required to comply with the Customer Due Diligence Rule, which clarified and strengthened the existing obligations for identifying new and existing customers and explicitly included risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence. All financial institutions also are required to establish internal anti-money laundering programs. The effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by the financial institution under the Bank Merger Act. The Company has a Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act board-approved compliance program commensurate with its risk profile.
Identity Theft Prevention
 
The Fair Credit Reporting Act’s (“FCRA”) Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions with covered accounts (e.g., consumer bank accounts and loans) to develop, implement and administer an identity theft prevention program. This program must include reasonable policies and procedures to detect suspicious patterns or practices that indicate the possibility of identity theft, such as inconsistencies in personal information or changes in account activity.

 Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
 
The United States government has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the “OFAC” rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in or providing investment-related advice or assistance to a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.
Financial Privacy and Data Security
 
The Company and the Bank are subject to federal laws, including the GLBA and certain state laws containing consumer privacy protection provisions. These provisions limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to affiliated and non-affiliated third parties and limit the reuse of certain consumer information received from nonaffiliated financial institutions. These provisions require notice of privacy policies to clients and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain nonpublic personal information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties by means of “opt out” or “opt in” authorizations.
 
The GLBA requires that financial institutions implement comprehensive written information security programs that include administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect consumer information. Further, pursuant to interpretive guidance issued under the GLBA and certain state laws, financial institutions are required to notify clients of security breaches resulting in unauthorized access to their personal information. The Bank believes it is in compliance with all GLBA obligations.
 
The Bank is also subject to data security standards, privacy and data breach notice requirements, primarily those issued by the OCC. The federal banking agencies, through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, have adopted guidelines to encourage financial institutions to address cyber security risks and identify, assess and mitigate these risks, both internally and at critical third party services providers.
 
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977
 
The Bank has a responsibility under the CRA, as implemented by OCC regulations, to help meet the credit needs of the communities it serves, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. Regulators periodically assess the Bank’s record of compliance with the CRA. The Bank’s failure to comply with the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of the Company. The Bank’s latest CRA rating was “Satisfactory.”
Future Legislative Initiatives
 
Congress, state legislatures and financial regulatory agencies may introduce various legislative and regulatory initiatives that could affect the financial services industry, generally. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and/or depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business of the Company.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, the Company had 1,791 full-time equivalent employees. The Company’s employees are not presently represented by any collective bargaining group.
