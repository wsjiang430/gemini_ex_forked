ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
The Buckle, Inc. (the "Company") is a retailer of medium to better-priced casual apparel, footwear, and accessories for fashion-conscious young men and women. As of January 28, 2023, the Company operated 441 retail stores in 42 states throughout the United States under the names "Buckle" and "Buckle Youth." The Company markets a wide selection of mostly brand name casual apparel including denims, other casual bottoms, tops, sportswear, outerwear, accessories, and footwear. The Company emphasizes personalized attention to its customers and provides customer services such as free hemming, free gift-packaging, easy layaways, the Buckle private label credit card, and a guest loyalty program. Most stores are located in regional shopping malls and lifestyle centers. In recent years, however, the Company has successfully relocated several of its stores in smaller and middle markets from enclosed malls into power center locations, with continued plans for pursuing more such relocation opportunities in the future. The majority of the Company's central office functions, including purchasing, pricing, accounting, advertising, and distribution, are controlled from its corporate offices and distribution center in Kearney, Nebraska. The Company’s men’s buying team is located in Overland Park, Kansas.
Incorporated in Nebraska in 1948, the Company commenced business under the name Mills Clothing, Inc., a conventional men's clothing store with only one location. In 1967, a second store, under the trade name Brass Buckle, was purchased. In the early 1970s, the store image changed to that of a jeans store with a wide selection of denims and shirts. The first branch store was opened in Columbus, Nebraska, in 1976. In 1977, the Company began selling young women's apparel and opened its first mall store. The Company changed its corporate name to The Buckle, Inc. on April 23, 1991 and has experienced significant growth since that time, operating 441 stores in 42 states at the end of fiscal 2022. All references herein to fiscal 2022 refer to the 52-week period ended January 28, 2023. Fiscal 2021 refers to the 52-week period ended January 29, 2022 and fiscal 2020 refers to the 52-week period ended January 30, 2021. All references herein to the “Company”, “Buckle”, “we”, “us”, or similar terms refer to The Buckle, Inc. and its subsidiary.
The Company's principal executive offices are located at 2407 West 24th Street, Kearney, Nebraska 68845. The Company's telephone number is (308) 236-8491. The Company publishes its corporate web site at www.buckle.com.

Merchandising
The Company's merchandising strategy is designed to create loyalty by offering a wide selection of key brand name and private label merchandise and providing a broad range of value-added services. The Company believes it provides a unique specialty apparel store experience with merchandise designed to appeal to the fashion-conscious 15 to 30-year old. The merchandise mix includes denims, casual bottoms, tops, sportswear, outerwear, accessories, and footwear. Denim is a significant contributor to total sales (39.3% of fiscal 2022 net sales) and is a key to the Company's merchandising strategy. The Company believes it attracts guests with its wide selection of branded and private label denim and a wide variety of fits, finishes, and styles. Tops are also significant contributors to total sales (29.7% of fiscal 2022 net sales). The Company strives to provide a continually changing selection of the latest casual fashions. 
The percentage of net sales over the past three fiscal years of the Company's major product lines are set forth in the following table:

 | Fiscal Years Ended
Merchandise Group | January 28,2023 | | January 29,2022 | | January 30,2021
Denims | 39.3 | % | | 39.6 | % | 40.1 | %
Tops (including sweaters) | 29.7 | | | 30.2 | | 30.1 | 
Accessories | 10.0 | | | 9.3 | | 9.0 | 
Footwear | 9.2 | | | 9.7 | | 10.2 | 
Sportswear/fashions | 5.5 | | | 5.9 | | 5.8 | 
Outerwear | 2.1 | | | 1.9 | | 1.9 | 
Casual bottoms | 1.1 | | | 0.9 | | 0.9 | 
Youth | 3.1 | | | 2.5 | | 2.0 | 
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

Brand name merchandise accounted for approximately 56% of the Company's net sales during fiscal 2022. The remaining balance is comprised of private label merchandise from exclusive brands including BKE, Buckle Black, Salvage, Red by BKE, Daytrip, Gimmicks, Gilded Intent, FITZ + EDDI, Willow & Root, Outpost Makers, Departwest, Sterling & Stitch, Reclaim, BKE Vintage, Nova Industries, J.B. Holt, Modish Rebel, and Veece. The Company's merchandisers continually work with manufacturers and vendors to produce brand name merchandise, the majority of which they believe is exclusive in terms of color, style, and fit. While the brands offered by the Company change to meet current customer preferences, the Company currently offers denims from brands such as Miss Me, Rock Revival, KanCan, Hidden, Flying Monkey, Levi's, Preme, Smoke Rise, Ariat, Good American, and Wrangler. Other key brands include Hurley, Billabong, Affliction, American Fighter, Sullen, Howitzer, Oakley, Fox, RVCA, 7 Diamonds, Nixon, Free People, Z Supply, Salt Life, White Crow, Brew City, Reef, Stance, Versace Cologne, American Highway, Eight X, Pendelton, Hooey, Goorin Bros., Old Row, Timberland, Teva, Kimes Ranch, SOREL, Hey Dude, Steve Madden, Dolce Vita, SAXX, Ray-Ban, Wanakome, Guess, Fossil, Brixton, Dr. Martens, Very G, Birkenstock, Bed Stu, Palladium, Mia, K-Swiss, Myra, STS, and G-Shock. The Company expects that brand name merchandise will continue to constitute the majority of sales.
Management believes the Company provides a unique store environment by maintaining a high level of personalized service and by offering a wide selection of fashionable, quality merchandise. The Company believes it is essential to create an enjoyable shopping environment and, in order to fulfill this mission, it employs highly motivated employees who provide personal attention to customers. Each salesperson is educated to help create a complete look for the customer by helping them find the best fits and showing merchandise as coordinating outfits. The Company also incorporates specialized services such as free hemming, free gift-packaging, layaways, a guest loyalty program, the Buckle private label credit card, personalized stylist services, and a special order system that allows stores to obtain specifically requested merchandise from other Company stores or from the Company's online order fulfillment center. 
Merchandising and pricing decisions are made centrally; however, the Company's distribution system allows for variation in the mix of merchandise distributed to each store. This allows individual store inventories to be tailored to reflect differences in customer buying patterns at various locations. In addition, to ensure a continually fresh look in its stores, the Company ships new merchandise daily to most stores. The Company also has a transfer program that shifts certain merchandise to locations where it is selling best. This distribution and transfer system helps to maintain customer satisfaction by providing in-stock popular items and reducing the need to markdown slow-moving merchandise at a particular location. The Company believes the reduced markdowns justify the incremental distribution costs associated with the transfer system. The Company does not hold store-wide off-price sales at any time.
The Company continually evaluates its store design as part of the overall shopping experience and feels its current design continues to be well received by both guests and developers. This store design contains warm wood fixtures and floors, real brick finishes, and an appealing ceiling and lighting layout that creates a comfortable environment for the guest to shop. The signature Buckle-B icon is used throughout the store on fixtures, graphic images, and print materials to reinforce the brand identity. To enhance selling and product presentation, the Company continually updates the fixtures in its stores. The Company has been able to modify the store design for specialized venues including lifestyle centers and larger mall fronts. Over the past several fiscal years, the Company has also developed updated storefront designs that enhance the exterior visibility for stores relocating from enclosed mall locations to outdoor power centers and lifestyle centers. 
Marketing and Advertising
In fiscal 2022, the Company spent $19.2 million, or 1.4% of net sales, on targeted seasonal marketing campaigns, digital marketing efforts, and in-store point-of-sale materials. A coordinated effort to amplify value and relevance through brand image, voice, and experience is presented through store window displays, seasonal and product-level signage throughout the store, and on digital commerce and experience platforms. Promotions such as special, seasonal events combined with gift-with-purchase offers are offered to enhance the guest’s shopping experience. Seasonal guides, featuring current fashion trends and product selection, are distributed in the stores, at special events, and in new markets. Additionally, Buckle partners with key merchandise vendors on joint advertising and promotional opportunities that expand the marketing reach and position Buckle as the first-choice for these specialty branded fashions.
The Company also offers programs to build and strengthen its relationship with loyal guests. In October 2020, the Company combined its multi-tender loyalty program (Buckle Guest Loyalty) and private label credit card rewards program (B-Rewards) into one, all-inclusive program (Buckle Rewards). The Buckle Rewards incentive program rewards loyal guests and cardholders with real-time rewards after 300 points have been earned. There are three tiers in the program, providing guests with opportunities to earn additional points and exclusive benefits. The base tier is available for all guests who enroll, while the top two tiers are exclusive to holders of a Buckle private label credit card. In addition to the stated benefits, the Company also extends other exclusive offers to Buckle Rewards members such as special bonus points opportunities, targeted mailings, and other exclusive offers. The Company provides a special Buckle Premier+ tier for its most loyal cardholders. Buckle Premier+ cardholders must purchase at least $1,000 annually using their Buckle credit card to qualify, and these guests enjoy additional benefits including free ground shipping on online purchases and special orders. The Buckle credit card marketing program is partially funded by Comenity Bank, a third-party bank that owns the credit card accounts. 
The Company supports a corporate web site at www.buckle.com. The Company’s web site serves as a portal to enhance, influence, and help its valued guests through their decision journey, reaching a growing online audience. Buckle.com provides an interactive, informative, and brand building environment where guests can shop, discover, learn, engage, and seek information, as well as search for career opportunities and read the Company’s latest financial news. The Company also maintains an opt-in email database. Targeted email campaigns are deployed informing guests of the latest styles and promotions. Paid-search, organic-search, and affiliate marketing programs are individually managed to increase online and in-store traffic. The Company continually invests in enhancements to the site's features and functionality, helping improve the overall digital guest experience and facilitate the growth in online traffic. 
Store Operations
The Company has an Executive Vice President of Stores, a Senior Vice President of Sales, 3 Vice Presidents of Sales, 4 Regional Managers, 32 District Managers, and 68 Area Managers. Certain district managers and all area managers also serve as manager of their home base store. In general, each store has 1 manager, 1 or 2 assistant managers, 1 to 3 additional full-time salespeople, and up to 20 part-time salespeople. Most stores have peak levels of staff during the back-to-school and holiday seasons. Almost every location also employs an alterations person.
The Company has established a comprehensive program stressing the prevention and control of shrinkage losses. Steps taken to reduce shrinkage include monitoring returns, cash refunds, voids, inappropriate discounts, and employee sales. The Company also has electronic article surveillance systems in all of the Company’s stores as well as surveillance camera systems in approximately 99% of the stores. As a result, the Company achieved a merchandise shrinkage rate of 0.4% of net sales in fiscal 2022, 0.3% of net sales in fiscal 2021, and 0.4% of net sales in fiscal 2020.
The average store is approximately 5,300 square feet (of which the Company estimates an average of approximately 80% is selling space), and stores range in size from 1,937 square feet to 9,935 square feet.
Purchasing and Distribution
The Company has an experienced buying team. The experience and leadership within the buying team contributes significantly to the Company’s success by enabling the buying team to react quickly to changes in fashion and by providing extensive knowledge of sources for both branded and private label goods. 
The Company purchases products from manufacturers within the United States as well as from agents who source goods from foreign manufacturers. The Company's merchandising team shops and monitors fashion to stay abreast of the latest trends. The Company continually monitors styles, quality, and delivery schedules. The Company has not experienced any material difficulties with merchandise manufactured in foreign countries. The Company does not have long-term or exclusive contracts with any brand name manufacturer, private label manufacturer, or supplier. The Company plans its private label production with private label vendors three to six months in advance of product delivery. The Company requires its vendors to sign and adhere to its Buckle Responsible Sourcing Standards & Code of Conduct, which addresses adherence to legal requirements regarding employment practices and health, safety, and environmental regulations.
In fiscal 2022, Axis Denim (which produces private label denim for the Company) accounted for 15.2% of net sales and Rock Revival/Miss Me accounted for 10.7% of the Company’s net sales. No other vendor accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales.
Buckle stores generally carry the same merchandise, with quantity and seasonal variations based upon historical sales data, climate, and perceived local customer demand. The Company uses a centralized receiving and distribution center located in Kearney, Nebraska. Merchandise is received daily in Kearney where it is sorted, tagged with bar-coded tickets (unless the vendor UPC code is used or the merchandise is pre-ticketed), and packaged for distribution to individual stores primarily via FedEx. The Company's goal is to ship the majority of its merchandise out to the stores within one to two business days of receipt. This system allows stores to receive new merchandise almost daily, creating excitement within the store and providing customers with a reason to shop often. 
The Company has developed an effective system for tracking merchandise from the time it is checked in at the Company's distribution center until it arrives at the stores and is sold to a customer. The system's function is to ensure that store shipments are delivered accurately and promptly, to account for inventory, and to assist in allocating merchandise among stores. Management can track, on a daily basis, which merchandise is selling at specific locations and direct transfers of merchandise from one store to another as necessary. This allows stores to carry a reduced inventory while at the same time satisfying customer demand. 
To reduce inter-store shipping costs and provide timely restocking of in-season merchandise, the Company warehouses a portion of initial shipments for later distribution. Sales data is then analyzed to replenish, on a basis of one to three times each week, those stores that are experiencing the greatest success selling specific styles, colors, and sizes of merchandise. This system is also designed to prevent an over-crowded look in the stores at the beginning of a season. 
During fiscal 2010, the Company completed construction of a 240,000 square foot distribution center in Kearney, Nebraska, which currently serves as the Company’s only store distribution center. The Company also owns two additional facilities as part of its home office campus in Kearney, Nebraska (one of which was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2015). These facilities serve as the Company's corporate headquarters and house its online fulfillment and customer service center. 
Store Locations and Expansion Strategies
As of January 28, 2023, the Company operated 441 stores in 42 states. The existing stores are in 3 downtown locations, 50 strip centers, 54 lifestyle centers, and 334 shopping malls. The Company anticipates opening 6 new stores in fiscal 2023. The following table lists the location of existing stores as of January 28, 2023:

Location of Stores
State | Number of Stores | State | Number of Stores | State | Number of Stores
Alabama | | Maryland | 1 | Oregon | 6 
Alaska | 1 | Michigan | 17 | Pennsylvania | 9 
Arizona | 12 | Minnesota | 11 | South Carolina | 4 
Arkansas | 7 | Mississippi | 6 | South Dakota | 3 
California | | Missouri | | Tennessee | 11 
Colorado | 15 | Montana | 5 | Texas | 54

Louisiana | 11 | Oklahoma | 11 | | 

Over the past ten years, Buckle has opened a total of 55 new stores and closed 54, with the number of openings and closings in a given year being based on local economic conditions and available opportunities. The Company intends to open new stores only when management believes there is a reasonable expectation of satisfactory results.
The following table sets forth information regarding store openings and closings from the beginning of fiscal 2013 through the end of fiscal 2022:

Total Number of Stores Per Year
Fiscal Year | Open at start of year | Opened in Current Year | Closed in Current Year | Open at end of year
2013 | 440 | 13 | 3 | 450 
2014 | 450 | 16 | 6 | 460 
2015 | 460 | 9 | 1 | 468 
2016 | 468 | | | 467 
2017 | 467 | 2 | 12 | 457 
2018 | 457 | — | 7 | 450 
2019 | 450 | 2 | 4 | 448 
2020 | 448 | 3 | 8 | 443 
2021 | 443 | 1 | 4 | 440 
2022 | 440 | 4 | 3 | 441 

The Company's criteria used when considering a particular location for expansion include: 
•Market area, including proximity to existing markets to capitalize on name recognition;
•Trade area population (number, average age, and college population);
•Economic vitality of market area;
•Location, anchor tenants, tenant mix, and average sales per square foot;
•Available location, square footage, storefront width, and facility of using the current store design;
•Availability of experienced management personnel for the market;
•Cost of rent, including minimum rent, common area, and extra charges; and
•Estimated construction costs, including landlord charge backs and tenant allowances.
The Company generally seeks sites of 4,250 to 5,000 square feet for its stores. The projected cost of opening a store is approximately $1.2 million, including construction costs of approximately $1.0 million (prior to any construction allowance received) and inventory costs of approximately $0.2 million, net of accounts payable.
The Company anticipates opening 6 new stores during fiscal 2023 and expects to complete approximately 12-17 full remodels. Year-to-date through March 28, 2023, the Company has closed 3 stores in fiscal 2023, with no other specific store closings currently planned for the remainder of the year. The construction costs for a full remodel are comparable to those of a new store. The Company also plans to complete several smaller store remodeling projects during fiscal 2023. The Company anticipates capital spending of approximately $24.0 to $30.0 million during fiscal 2023, which includes primarily planned store projects and technology investments.
The Company's ability to expand in the future will depend, in part, on general business conditions, the ability to find suitable locations with acceptable sites on satisfactory terms, and the readiness of trained store managers. There can be no assurance that the Company's future expansion plans will be fulfilled in whole or in part, or that leases for potential new sites will be obtained on terms favorable to the Company. 
Information Technology
The Company's information technology systems consist of a full range of retail, financial, and merchandising platforms, including purchasing, inventory distribution and control, financial reporting, accounts payable, and merchandise management.
The system includes PC based point-of-sale ("POS") registers in each store. The registers trickle transactions to a central server using a virtual private network ("VPN") for collection of comprehensive data, including complete item-level sales information. The transactions are then swept into the central database (IBM iSeries). Price updates are sent daily for the price lookup (“PLU”) file maintained within the POS registers. 
Twice a week, the Company initiates an electronic "sweep" of the individual store bank accounts to the Company's primary concentration account. This allows the Company to meet its obligations and invest cash on a timely basis.
Management monitors the performance of each of its stores on a continual basis. Daily information is used to evaluate inventory, determine markdowns, analyze profitability, and assist management in the scheduling and compensation of employees. 
The PLU system allows management to control merchandise pricing centrally, permitting faster and more accurate processing of sales at the store and the monitoring of specific inventory items to confirm that centralized pricing decisions are carried out in each of the stores. Management is able to direct all price changes, including promotional, clearance, and markdowns on a central basis and estimate the financial impact of such changes.
The VPN for communication with the stores also supports the Company’s intranet site. The intranet allows stores to view various types of information from the corporate office. Stores also have access to a variety of tools such as a product search with pictures, product availability, special order functions, inventory management, scheduling, performance tracking, printable forms, links to transmit various requests and information to the corporate office, training videos, email, and information/guidelines from each of the departments at the corporate office. The Company’s network is also structured so that it can support additional functionality such as digital video monitoring and digital music content programming at each store location.
The Company is committed to the ongoing review of its technology systems to maintain productive, timely information and effective controls. This review includes testing of new products and systems to ensure that the Company is aware of technological developments. Most important, continual feedback is sought from every level of the Company to ensure that information provided is pertinent to all aspects of the Company's operations. 
Employees and Human Capital
The Company’s employees, which we refer to as our “teammates,” are critical to carrying out Buckle’s mission statement, “to create the most enjoyable shopping experience possible for our guests.” The Company’s success is highly dependent on the continued contributions of all teammates, including those in the Company’s stores, distribution center, and corporate offices. As a result, the Company seeks to recruit and retain talented teammates through competitive pay and benefits offerings, along with an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes education, training, and advancement.
Teammate Demographics. As of January 28, 2023, the Company had approximately 9,100 teammates, of which approximately 3,100 were full-time. Of the total number of teammates, approximately 830 were employed at the corporate offices and in the distribution center. The Company has an experienced management team and most of the management team, from store managers through senior management, began work for the Company on the sales floor. The Company experiences high turnover of store and distribution center teammates, primarily due to the number of part-time teammates. However, the Company has not experienced significant difficulty in hiring qualified personnel. 
Teammate Compensation. Buckle's entrepreneurial culture is vital to our continued success. As such, we seek to offer competitive base pay and benefits to our teammates, as well as incentive compensation tied to both individual and overall Company performance. As teammates advance, a larger share of their compensation generally becomes performance-based. For example, the majority of store teammates are compensated with a base plus commission structure. Store managers receive compensation in the form of a base salary and incentive bonuses based on the individual performance of their store. District and area managers receive incentives based upon the performance of the stores in their district/area. We believe our incentive-based compensation structure creates a sense of ownership amongst our teammates. This aligns with our entrepreneurial culture, motivating our teammates to constantly seek improvements in the service we provide to our guests.
Training and Advancement. The Company invests heavily in the education, training, and leadership development of its teammates. Store managers perform sales training for new teammates at the store level, utilizing training videos and educational programs developed by sales leadership. As teammates progress, leadership development opportunities are provided through the Company's Leadership Academy, which is designed to prepare potential future leaders for store management opportunities. Additionally, the Company hosts manager meetings three times per year to provide continuing education and leadership development opportunities for our store managers. At the corporate offices, teammates are afforded professional growth opportunities aligned with their area of responsibility, including internal trainings, industry seminars and conferences, and experiential opportunities. Mentoring is also an important training and development tool utilized at all levels of the Company.
Competition
The men's and women's apparel industries are highly competitive with fashion, selection, quality, price, location, store environment, and service being the principal competitive factors. While the Company believes it is able to compete favorably with other merchandisers, including department stores and specialty retailers, with respect to each of these factors, the Company believes it competes mainly on the basis of customer service and merchandise selection.
In the men's merchandise area, the Company competes primarily with specialty retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters, Boot Barn, Express, Gap, Hollister, PacSun, Scheels, and Tilly’s. The men's market also competes with certain department stores, such as Dillards, Macy’s, Nordstrom, and certain local or regional department stores and small specialty stores, as well as with direct-to-consumer brands and online retailers.
In the women's merchandise area, the Company competes primarily with specialty retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Altar'd State, American Eagle Outfitters, Anthropologie, Boot Barn, Express, Forever 21, Francesca's, Free People, H&M, Hollister, Journey's, Lulus, Madewell, Maurices, PacSun, Revolve, Scheels, Tilly's, Urban Outfitters, Zara, and Zumiez. The women's market also competes with department stores, such as Dillards, Macy’s, Nordstrom, and certain local or regional department stores, and small specialty boutiques, as well as with direct-to-consumer brands and online retailers.
Many of the Company's competitors are considerably larger and have substantially greater financial, marketing, and other resources than the Company, and there is no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully with them in the future. Furthermore, while the Company believes it competes effectively for favorable site locations and lease terms, competition for prime locations is intense.
Seasonality
The Company's business is seasonal, with the holiday season (from approximately November 15 to December 30) and the back-to-school season (from approximately July 15 to September 1) historically contributing the greatest volume of net sales. For fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, the holiday and back-to-school seasons accounted for approximately 35% of the Company's fiscal year net sales.

The Company also owns trademarks for certain product designs. The Company believes the strength of its trademarks is of considerable value to its business, and its trademarks are important to its marketing efforts. The Company intends to protect and promote its trademarks as management deems appropriate.
Regulation
The Company and the merchandise it sells are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, because some of the merchandise the Company sells is manufactured by foreign suppliers and imported by the Company, the Company’s operations are subject to a variety of trade laws, customs regulations, and international trade agreements. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and at the present time is not expected to have, a material effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position. See “ITEM 1A – Risk Factors – Reliance on Foreign Sources of Production” for additional information.
