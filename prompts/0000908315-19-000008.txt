     ITEM 1:     BUSINESS
     Background
     We are a franchisor of five value-oriented retail store concepts that buy, sell and trade gently used merchandise.  Each of our retail store brands emphasizes consumer value by offering high-quality used merchandise at substantial savings from the price of new merchandise and by purchasing customers’ used goods that have been outgrown or are no longer used.  Our concepts also offer a limited amount of new merchandise to customers.  As of December 29, 2018, we had 1,241 franchised stores across the United States and Canada. In addition, we provide franchise consulting and advisory services to new and emerging franchisors through Winmark Franchise Partners, which we launched in 2017.
     We operate a middle-market equipment leasing business through our wholly owned subsidiary, Winmark Capital Corporation.  Our middle-market leasing business serves large and medium-sized organizations and focuses on technology and business-essential equipment.  The businesses we target generally have annual revenue of between $30 million and several billion dollars.  We generate middle-market equipment leases primarily through business alliances, equipment vendors and directly from customers.
     Additionally, we operate a small-ticket financing business through our wholly owned subsidiary, Wirth Business Credit, Inc.  Our small-ticket financing business serves small businesses and focuses on assets which generally have a cost of $5,000 to $100,000.
     Our significant assets are located within the United States, and we generate all revenues from United States operations other than franchising revenues from Canadian operations of approximately $4.4 million, $3.8 million and $3.3 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  For additional financial information, please see Item 6 — Selected Financial Data and Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  We were incorporated in Minnesota in 1988.
     Franchise Operations
     Our retail brands with their fiscal year 2018 system-wide sales, which we define as estimated revenues generated by all franchise locations, are summarized as follows:
     Plato’s Closet® - $489 million.
     We began franchising the Plato’s Closet brand in 1999.  Plato’s Closet stores buy and sell used clothing and accessories geared toward the teenage and young adult market.  Customers have the opportunity to sell their used items to Plato’s Closet stores and to purchase quality used clothing and accessories at prices lower than new merchandise.     Once Upon A Child® - $350 million.
     We began franchising the Once Upon A Child brand in 1993.  Once Upon A Child stores buy and sell used and, to a lesser extent, new children’s clothing, toys, furniture, equipment and accessories.  This brand primarily targets parents of children ages infant to 12 years.  These customers have the opportunity to sell their used children’s items to a Once Upon A Child store when outgrown and to purchase quality used children’s clothing, toys, furniture and equipment at prices lower than new merchandise.     Play It Again Sports® - $223 million.
     We began franchising the Play It Again Sports brand in 1988.  Play It Again Sports stores buy, sell, trade and consign used and new sporting goods, equipment and accessories for a variety of athletic activities including team sports (baseball/softball, hockey, football, lacrosse, soccer), fitness, ski/snowboard and golf among others.  The stores offer a flexible mix of merchandise that is adjusted to adapt to seasonal and regional differences.

 Style Encore® - $44 million.
     We began franchising the Style Encore brand in 2013.  Style Encore stores buy and sell used women’s apparel, shoes and accessories.  Customers have the opportunity to sell their used items to Style Encore stores and to purchase quality used clothing, shoes and accessories at prices lower than new merchandise.     Music Go Round® - $34 million.
     We began franchising the Music Go Round brand in 1994.  Music Go Round stores buy, sell, trade and consign used and, to a lesser extent, new musical instruments, speakers, amplifiers, music-related electronics and related accessories.

      Retail Brands Franchising Overview
     We use franchising as a business method of distributing goods and services through our retail brands to consumers.  We, as franchisor, own a retail business brand, represented by a service mark or similar right, and an operating system for the franchised business.  We then enter into franchise agreements with franchisees and grant the franchisee the right to use our business brand, service marks and operating system to manage a retail business.  Franchisees are required to operate their retail businesses according to the systems, specifications, standards and formats we develop for the business brand.  We train the franchisees how to operate the franchised business.  We also provide continuing support and service to our franchisees.
     We have developed value-oriented retail brands based on a mix of used and, to a lesser extent, new merchandise.  We franchise rights to franchisees who open franchised locations under such brands.  The key elements of our franchise strategy include:

· | franchising the rights to operate retail stores offering value-oriented merchandise;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | attracting new, qualified franchisees; and
--+-------------------------------------------


· | providing initial and continuing support to franchisees.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 Offering Value-Oriented Merchandise
     Our retail brands provide value to consumers by purchasing and reselling used merchandise that consumers have outgrown or no longer use at substantial savings from the price of new merchandise.  By offering a combination of high-quality used and value-priced new merchandise, we benefit from consumer demand for value-oriented retailing.  In addition, we believe that among national retail operations our retail store brands provide a unique source of value to consumers by purchasing used merchandise.  We also believe that the strategy of buying used merchandise increases consumer awareness of our retail brands.     Attracting Franchisees
     Our franchise marketing program for retail brands seeks to attract prospective franchisees with experience in management and operations and an interest in being the owner and operator of their own business.  We seek franchisees who:
· | have a sufficient net worth;
--+-----------------------------


· | have prior business experience; and
--+------------------------------------


· | intend to be integrally involved with the management of the business.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

      At December 29, 2018, we had 47 signed retail franchise agreements, of which the majority are expected to open in 2019.
     We began franchising in Canada in 1991 and, as of December 29, 2018, had 113 franchised retail stores open in Canada.  The Canadian retail stores are operated by franchisees under agreements substantially similar to those used in the United States.
     Retail Brand Franchise Support
     As a franchisor, our success depends upon our ability to develop and support competitive and successful franchise brands.  We emphasize the following areas of franchise support and assistance.     Training
     Each franchisee must attend our training program regardless of prior experience.  Soon after signing a franchise agreement, the franchisee is required to attend new owner orientation training.  This course covers basic management issues, such as preparing a business plan, lease evaluation, evaluating insurance needs and obtaining financing.  Our training staff assists each franchisee in developing a business plan for their retail store with financial and cash flow projections.  The second training session is centered on store operations.  It covers, among other things, point-of-sale computer training, inventory selection and acquisition, sales, marketing and other topics.  We provide the franchisee with operations manuals that we periodically update.     Field Support
     We provide operations personnel to assist the franchisee in the opening of a new business.  We also have an ongoing field support program designed to assist franchisees in operating their retail stores.  Our franchise support personnel visit each retail store periodically and, in most cases, a business assessment is made to determine whether the franchisee is operating in accordance with our standards.  The visit is also designed to assist franchisees with operational issues.     Purchasing
     During training each franchisee is taught how to evaluate, purchase and price used goods directly from customers.  We have developed specialized computer point-of-sale systems for our brands that provide the franchisee with standardized pricing information to assist in the purchasing of used items.
     We provide centralized buying services, which on a limited basis include credit and billing for the Play It Again Sports franchisees.  Our Play It Again Sports franchise system uses several major vendors for new product including Nautilus, Wilson Sporting Goods, Champro Sports, Easton Sports, CCM Hockey and Bauer Hockey.  The loss of any of the above vendors would change the vendor mix, but not significantly change our products offered.
    
 
  3

 

 To provide the franchisees of our Play It Again Sports, Once Upon A Child and Music Go Round systems a source of affordable new product, we have developed relationships with our significant vendors and negotiated prices for our franchisees to take advantage of the buying power a franchise system brings.
     Our typical Once Upon A Child franchised store purchases approximately 30% of its new product from Rachel’s Ribbons, Wild Side Accessories, Melissa & Doug and Nuby.  The loss of any of the above vendors would change the vendor mix, but not significantly change our products offered.
     Our typical Music Go Round franchised store purchases approximately 50% of its new product from KMC/Musicorp, RapcoHorizon Company, D’Addario, GHS Corporation and Ernie Ball.  The loss of any of the above vendors would change the vendor mix, but not significantly change our products offered.
     There are no significant vendors of new products to our typical Plato’s Closet and Style Encore franchised stores as new product is an extremely low percentage of sales for these brands.
     Retail Advertising and Marketing
     We encourage our franchisees to implement a marketing program that includes the following: television, radio, point-of-purchase materials, in store signage and local store marketing programs as well as email marketing promotions, website promotions and participation in social and digital media.  Franchisees of the respective retail brands are required to spend a minimum of 5% of their gross sales on approved advertising and marketing.  Franchisees may be required to participate in regional cooperative advertising groups.     Computerized Point-Of-Sale Systems
     We require our retail brand franchisees to use a retail information management computer system in each store, which has evolved with the development of new technology.  This computerized point-of-sale system is designed specifically for use in our franchise retail stores.  The current system includes our proprietary Data Recycling System software, a dedicated server, two or more work station registers, a receipt printer, a report printer and a bar code scanner, together with software modules for inventory management, cash management and customer information management.  Our franchisees purchase the computer hardware from us.  The Data Recycling System software is designed to accommodate buying of used merchandise.  This system provides franchisees with an important management tool that reduces errors, increases efficiencies and enhances inventory control.  We provide point-of-sale system support through our Computer Support Center located at our Company headquarters.     The Retail Franchise Agreement
     We enter into franchise agreements with our franchisees.  The following is a summary of certain key provisions of our current standard retail brand franchise agreement.  Except as noted, the franchise agreements used for each of our retail brands are generally the same.
     Each franchisee must execute our franchise agreement and pay an initial franchise fee.  At December 29, 2018, the franchise fee for all brands was $25,000 for an initial store in the U.S. and $31,500CAD for an initial store in Canada.  Once a franchisee opens its initial store, it can open additional stores, in any brand, by paying a $15,000 franchise fee for a store in the U.S. and $19,000CAD for a store in Canada, provided an acceptable territory is available and the franchisee meets the brand’s additional store standards.  The franchise fee for our initial retail store and additional retail store in Canada is based upon the exchange rate applied to the United States franchise fee on the last business day of the preceding fiscal year.  The franchise fee in March 2019 for an initial retail store in Canada will be $34,000CAD, and an additional retail store in Canada will be $20,500CAD. Typically, the franchisee’s initial store is open for business approximately 12 months from the date the franchise agreement is signed.  The franchise agreement has an initial term of 10 years, with subsequent 10-year renewal periods, and grants the franchisee an exclusive geographic area, which will vary in size depending upon population, demographics and other factors.  Under current franchise agreements, franchisees of the respective brands are required to pay us weekly continuing fees (royalties) equal to the percentage of gross sales outlined in their Franchise Agreements, generally ranging from 4% to 5% for all of our brands.
     Each Franchisee is required to pay us an annual marketing fee of $1,000.  Each new or renewing franchisee is required to spend 5% of its gross sales for advertising and promoting its franchised store.  Currently, for all of the retail brands except Play It Again Sports, we have the option to increase the minimum advertising expenditure requirement from 5% 

 
  4

 
to 6% of the franchisee’s gross sales, of which up to 2% would be paid to us as an advertising fee for deposit into an advertising fund.  While we currently do not have the option to increase the advertising expenditure requirement for Play It Again Sports franchisees, we may also require those franchisees to pay 2% of their gross sales into an advertising fund.  This fund, if initiated, would be managed by us and would be used for advertising and promotion of the franchise system.
     During the term of a franchise agreement, franchisees agree not to operate directly or indirectly any competitive business.  In addition, franchisees agree that after the end of the term or termination of the franchise agreement, franchisees will not operate any competitive business for a period of two years and within a reasonable geographic area.
     Although our franchise agreements contain provisions designed to assure the quality of a franchisee’s operations, we have less control over a franchisee’s operations than we would if we owned and operated a retail store.  Under the franchise agreement, we have a right of first refusal on the sale of any franchised store, but we are not obligated to repurchase any franchise.
     Renewal of the Franchise Relationship
     At the end of the 10-year term of each franchise agreement, each franchisee has the option to “renew” the franchise relationship by signing a new 10-year franchise agreement.  If a franchisee chooses not to sign a new franchise agreement, a franchisee must comply with all post termination obligations including the franchisee’s noncompetition clause discussed above.  We may choose not to renew the franchise relationship only when permitted by the franchise agreement and applicable state law.
     We believe that renewing a significant number of these franchise relationships is important to the success of the Company.  During the past three years, we renewed 99% of franchise agreements up for renewal.
     Retail Franchising Competition
     Retailing, including the sale of teenage, children’s and women’s apparel, sporting goods and musical instruments, is highly competitive.  Many retailers have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do.  Our franchisees compete with established, locally owned retail stores, discount chains and traditional retail stores for sales of new merchandise.  Full line retailers generally carry little or no used merchandise.  Resale, thrift and consignment shops and garage and rummage sales offer competition to our franchisees for the sale of used merchandise.  Also, our franchisees increasingly compete with online used and new goods marketplaces such as eBay, craigslist and many others.
     Our Plato’s Closet franchise stores primarily compete with specialty apparel stores such as American Eagle, Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, Old Navy, Hollister and Forever 21.  We compete with other franchisors in the teenage resale clothing retail market.
     Our Once Upon A Child franchisees compete primarily with large retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target and various specialty children’s retail stores such as Gap Kids. We compete with other franchisors in the specialty children’s resale retail market.
     Our Play It Again Sports franchisees compete with large retailers such as Dick’s Sporting Goods, Academy Sports & Outdoors as well as regional and local sporting goods stores.  We also compete with Target and Wal-Mart.
     Our Style Encore franchise stores compete with a wide range of women’s apparel stores. We also compete with other franchisors in the women’s resale clothing retail market.
     Our Music Go Round franchise stores compete with large musical instrument retailers such as Guitar Center as well as local independent musical instrument stores.
     Our retail franchises may face additional competition in the future.  This could include additional competitors that may enter the used merchandise market.  We believe that our franchisees will continue to be able to compete with other retailers based on the strength of our value-oriented brands and the name recognition associated with our service marks.
     We also face competition in connection with the sale of franchises.  Our prospective franchisees frequently evaluate other franchise opportunities before purchasing a franchise from us.  We compete with other franchise companies for 

 
  5

 
franchisees based on the following factors, among others: amount of initial investment, franchise fee, royalty rate, profitability, franchisor services and industry.  We believe that our franchise brands are competitive with other franchises based on the fees we charge, our franchise support services and the performance of our existing franchise brands.
     Winmark Franchise Partners®
     During 2017, we announced the launch of an initiative to provide consulting services, support and capital to emerging franchisors. Under the Winmark Franchise Partners mark, we leverage our experience in franchising through strategic partnering with select companies interested in franchising to grow their brands.  We anticipate that this concept will create additional revenue streams while being synergistic with our existing business.     Equipment Leasing Operations
     We operate a middle-market leasing business through Winmark Capital Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary.  We operate a small-ticket financing business through Wirth Business Credit, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary.  We incorporated both of these subsidiaries in April 2004.  To differentiate ourselves from our competitors in the leasing industry, we offer innovative lease and financing products and concentrate on building long-term relationships with our customers and business alliances.     Winmark Capital Corporation
     Winmark Capital Corporation is engaged in the business of providing non-cancelable leases for high-technology and business-essential assets to both larger organizations and smaller, growing companies.  We target businesses with annual revenue between $30 million and several billion dollars.  We focus on transactions that have terms from two to three years.  Such transactions are generally larger than $250,000 and include high-technology equipment and/or business essential equipment, including computers, telecommunications equipment, storage systems, network equipment and other business-essential equipment.  The leases are retained in our portfolio to accommodate equipment additions and upgrades to meet customers’ changing needs.     Industry
     The high-technology equipment industry has been characterized by rapid and continuous advancements permitting broadened user applications and reductions in processing costs.  The introduction of new equipment generally does not cause existing equipment to become obsolete but usually does cause the market value of existing equipment to decrease, reflecting the improved performance per dollar cost of the new equipment.  Users frequently replace equipment as their existing equipment becomes inadequate for their needs or as increased processing capacity is required, creating a secondary market in used equipment.
     Generally, high-technology equipment, such as information technology equipment, does not suffer from material physical deterioration if properly maintained.  As required under our leases, our leased equipment must be kept under continual maintenance, in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications, most often provided by the manufacturer.  The economic life and residual value of information technology equipment is subject to, among other things, the development of technological improvements and changes in sale and maintenance terms initiated by the manufacturer.
     Business Strategy
     Our business strategy allows us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors in the leasing industry.  Key elements of this strategy include:
    
· | Relationship Focus. We maintain a focused, long-term, customer-service approach to our business. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Full Service. We can service the equipment leasing needs of both large organizations as well as smaller, growing companies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Asset Ownership. We differentiate ourselves with our commitment to retain ownership of our leases throughout the lease term. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Leasing and Sales Activities
     Our middle-market lease products are marketed nationally through our offices in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Santa Barbara, California.
     We market our leasing services directly to end-users and indirectly through business alliances, and through vendors of equipment, software, value-added services and consulting services.  We directly market to customers and prospects by telephone canvassing and by establishing relationships with business alliances in the local business community.
     We generally lease high-technology and other business-essential equipment.  Additionally, we may lease operating system and application software to our customers, but typically only with a hardware lease.  Our standard lease agreement, entered into with each customer, is a noncancelable “net” lease which contains “hell-or-high water” provisions under which the customer, upon acceptance of the equipment, must make all lease payments regardless of any defects or performance of the equipment, and which require the customer to maintain and service the equipment, insure the equipment against casualty loss and pay all property, sales and other taxes related to the equipment.  We retain ownership of the equipment we lease and, in the event of default by the customer, we or the financial institution to whom the lease payment has been assigned may declare the customer in default, accelerate all lease payments due under the lease and pursue other available remedies, including repossession of the equipment.  Upon expiration of the initial term or extended lease term, depending on the structure of the lease, the customer may:
    
· | return the equipment to us;
--+----------------------------


· | renew the lease for an additional term; or
--+-------------------------------------------


· | purchase the equipment.
--+------------------------

      If the equipment is returned to us, it will typically be sold into the secondary-user marketplace.
     Wirth Business Credit, Inc.
     Our small-ticket financing operation serves the needs of small businesses.  Small-ticket financing transactions are typically between $5,000 and $100,000, have terms of between two and four years and cover business essential assets, including computers, printing equipment, security systems, telecommunications equipment, production equipment and other assets.  Our financing transactions are generally full pay out transactions, which means, after paying all required payments under the financing agreement, the customer owns the asset.  Key elements of our small-ticket business strategy include a focus on both business owners and equipment vendor relationships as well as providing fast credit decisions, flexible terms and an easy to understand process.
     The small ticket finance industry is highly fragmented and competitive. Small business owners typically finance their businesses through one of many possible sources including banks, vendor captive finance companies, leasing brokers, credit card companies and independent leasing companies.  These sources of funding typically limit their focus to certain types of transactions and may base their decision on credit quality, geography, size of transaction, type of asset or other criteria.
     Financing
     To date, we have funded the vast majority of our leases internally using our available cash or debt.
     Winmark Capital Corporation may from time to time arrange permanent financing of leases through non-recourse discounting of lease rentals with various financial institutions at fixed interest rates.  The proceeds from the assignment of the lease rentals will generally be equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments due under the lease, discounted at the interest rate charged by the financial institution.  Interest rates obtained under this type of financing are negotiated on a transaction-by-transaction basis and reflect the financial strength of the customer, the term of the lease and the prevailing interest rates.  In the event of a default by a customer in non-recourse financing, the financial institution has a first lien on the underlying leased equipment, with no further recourse against us.  The institution may, however, take title to the collateral in the event the customer fails to make lease payments or certain other defaults by the customer occur under the terms of the lease.  Our use of lease discounting is dependent upon having leases that are attractive to financial institutions as well as our available cash balances.

 Equipment Leasing Competition
     We compete with a variety of equipment financing sources that are available to businesses, including:  national, regional and local finance companies that provide lease and loan products; financing through captive finance and leasing companies affiliated with major equipment manufacturers; credit card companies; and commercial banks, savings and loans, and credit unions.  Many of these companies are substantially larger than we are and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
     Some of our competitors have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us.  A lower cost of funds could enable a competitor to offer leases with yields that are much less than the yields that we offer, which might cause us to lose lease origination volume.  In addition, certain of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could enable them to establish more origination sources and end user customer relationships and increase their market share.  We have and will continue to encounter significant competition.
     Government Regulation
     Fourteen states, the Federal Trade Commission and six Canadian Provinces impose pre-sale franchise registration and/or disclosure requirements on franchisors.  In addition, a number of states have statutes which regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship such as termination, nonrenewal, transfer, discrimination among franchisees and competition with franchisees.
     Additional legislation, both at the federal and state levels, could expand pre-sale disclosure requirements, further regulate substantive aspects of the franchise relationship and require us to file our Franchise Disclosure Documents with additional states.  We cannot predict the effect of future franchise legislation, but do not believe there is any imminent legislation currently under consideration which would have a material adverse impact on our operations.
     Although most states do not directly regulate the commercial equipment lease financing business, certain states require licensing of lenders and finance companies, and impose limitations on interest rates and other charges, and a disclosure of certain contract terms and constrain collection practices.  We believe that we are currently in compliance with all material statutes and regulations that are applicable to our business.
     Trademarks and Service Marks
     Plato’s Closet®, Once Upon A Child®, Play It Again Sports®, Style Encore®, Music Go Round®, Winmark®, Wirth Business Credit®, Winmark Capital® and Winmark Franchise Partners®, among others, are our registered service marks.  These marks are of considerable value to our business.  We intend to protect our service marks by appropriate legal action where and when necessary.  Each service mark registration must be renewed every 10 years.  We have taken, and intend to continue to take, all steps necessary to renew the registration of all our material service marks.     Seasonality
     Our Plato’s Closet and Once Upon A Child franchise brands have experienced higher than average sales volumes during the spring months and during the back-to-school season.  Our Play It Again Sports franchise brand has experienced higher than average sales volumes during the winter season.  Overall, the different seasonal trends of our brands partially offset each other and do not result in significant seasonality trends on a Company-wide basis.  Our equipment leasing business is not seasonal; however, quarter to quarter results often vary significantly.     Employees
     As of December 29, 2018, we employed 107 employees.
