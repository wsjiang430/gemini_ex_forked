This annual report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
We provide visa consultancy services to individuals or groups of individuals, and legal entities. We consult our customers on the terms of how to obtain a visa to a particular country, what the requirements are for visa-free countries, for instance a maximum period of stay, or countries issuing visa on arrival. We provide full and up-to-date information regarding documents, difficulties or any limitations in the process of receiving a visa. We assist in gathering documents and filling out the forms either printed or online, as an embassy requires, or providing step-by- step guidelines and instructions to a successful completion of the process. We also provide interpreters for the cases when the applicant must present in person.
