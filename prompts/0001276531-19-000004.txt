Item 1. BUSINESS
Background

Scientific Energy, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Utah on May 30, 2001. Prior to April 2006, the Company had endeavored to develop and manufacture various energy generation devices and energy efficient mechanisms. The current business plan of the Company is to engage in a business of e-commerce platform.

In January 2008, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with China Resources Development Group Ltd., a Hong Kong company.  Under the agreement, a joint venture company, Kabond Investments Ltd (the JVC), was established in Hong Kong, and the Company invested $39.6 million Hong Kong dollars (approximately $5.09 million) into the JVC for 72% of the JVCs capital shares, and China Resources Development Group Ltd., jointly with its partner, invested $15.4 million Hong Kong dollars (approximately $1.98 million) into the JVC to receive 28% of the JVCs capital shares. In December 2008, all equity interest of the JVC owned by the Company was sold to a third party for $39.6 million Hong Kong dollars (approximately $5,109,743).

In January 2009, the Company through its wholly-owned subsidiary, PDI Global Limited (a British Virgin Islands corporation, PDI), entered into a joint venture agreement with China Resources Development Group Ltd. Under the agreement, the Company agreed to invest $43,040,000 Hong Kong dollars (approximately $5.55 million) into a joint venture company Sinoforte Ltd. in Hong Kong (Sinoforte). The Company got 80% of Sinoforte's capital shares, and China Resources invested $10,222,000 Hong Kong dollars, approximately $1,318,967, and another investor invested $538,000 Hong Kong dollars, or approximately $69,419, into Sinoforte for 19% and 1% of Sinoforte's capital shares, respectively. The main business of Sinoforte was trading mineral products such as graphite produced in China. In June 2009 and September 2009, respectively, China Resources and the other minority investor cancelled their investments in Sinoforte, and the full amount of their original investments was returned. As a result, Sinoforte became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PDI. 

The Company has not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.

Business

The Company conducts business primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary Sinoforte Ltd., a Hong Kong corporation.

Prior to August 2011, the Company operated primarily as a merchant, buying and selling various type and grades of graphite, such as medium- and high-carbon graphite, high-purity graphite, micro-powder graphite and expandable graphite. As a merchant, the Company acted as a reseller. It purchased graphite products in bulk, primarily from graphite producers, and resold them, either in bulk or in smaller quantities (in either case, without further processing), to various small and mid-sized customers. 

In August 2011, the Company started to engage in a business of e-commerce platform. Currently the Company is in the process of developing a website, Makeliving.com ("Makeliving"), which provides an e-commerce platform, where registered members can exchange goods and services. 

Makeliving will act both as a platform and as a conduit between those (individuals or companies) who desire to acquire goods and services and those (individuals or companies) who desire to offer goods and services.  Makeliving plans to charge a certain percentage fee for the transactions. However, no revenues have been generated. The website is now temporarily under maintenance. At the same time, the Company is considering new business models.

On January 23, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with Cityhill Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of South Sea Petroleum Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong listed public company, pursuant to which parties agreed to establish a joint venture (the Joint Venture). Each party owns 50% equity interest in the Joint Venture respectively.

The Venture Joint, with the support of blockchain technology, is to provide global trading service of physical gold for global customers. The parties contribute their respective experiences in blockchain technology and marketing. The Company will assist the Joint Venture in exploring the North America and Europe markets, while Cityhill will focus on the Asian markets.
