Item 1. Business 
Overview
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 15, 2009. On July 25, 2014, we acquired 100% of the membership interests of Hydro Innovations, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“Hydro Innovations”), from Stephen and Brandy Keen (the “Keens”). Hydro Innovations was founded by the Keens in Austin, Texas in 2006 to provide agricultural and other growers with the means to maintain a properly controlled indoor cultivation environment with customized, purpose-built cooling equipment, rather than repurposing conventional equipment made for comfort cooling. In 2011, Hydro Innovations delivered its environmental control system to one of the first commercial, state-regulated cannabis cultivation facilities licensed to grow medical cannabis in Arizona.
 
As state laws regarding the use of cannabis have evolved, we have focused on designing, engineering and manufacturing application-specific environmental control and air sanitation systems for commercial, state- and provincial-regulated indoor cannabis cultivation facilities in the U.S. and Canada. Our engineering and technical team provides energy and water efficient solutions that allow growers to meet the unique demands of a cannabis cultivation environment through precise temperature, humidity, light, and process controls and to satisfy the evolving code and regulatory requirements being imposed at the state, provincial and local levels.
 
Our objective is to leverage our experience in this sector of the overall cannabis cultivation industry in order to bring value-added climate control solutions to our customers that help improve their overall crop quality and yield as well as optimize the resource efficiency of their controlled environment (i.e., indoor and sealed greenhouses) cultivation facilities. We have been involved in consulting, equipment sales and/or full-scale design for over 800 grow facilities since 2006, making us a trusted resource for indoor environmental design and control management for the cannabis industry.
 
Our customers include businesses from small cultivation operations to licensed commercial facilities ranging from several thousand to more than 100,000 square feet. We have sold our equipment and systems throughout the U.S. and Canada. Our revenue stream is derived primarily from supplying mechanical engineering services and climate and environmental control equipment to commercial indoor cannabis grow facilities. Although our customers do, we neither produce nor sell cannabis.
 
We are headquartered in Boulder, Colorado.
 
Shares of our common stock are traded on the OTCMarkets under the ticker symbol “SRNA.”
 
Our New Business Model and Strategy
 
Introduction
 
Indoor cannabis cultivators are facing the multiple headwinds of high energy costs, increasingly rigorous quality standards and declining cannabis prices. To be competitive, among other things, our customers must develop innovative ways to meet the demands of their business and reduce energy costs, 90% of which is related to their HVAC and lighting systems. That is our focus. We deliver products and services for our customers’ entire facility lifecycles, not just a “one-and-done” environmental control engineering/design and equipment package as part of a facility’s initial construction. We have the advantage of early engagement with our customers at the pre-build and construction phases and the opportunity for building longer-term relationships with our existing customers and their facilities. Going forward, our plan is to capitalize on our existing customer relationships and attempt to become “stickier” to our customers, seeking to generate incremental and recurring revenue.
 
We have three core assets that we intend to leverage as part of our going forward business strategy. First, we have multi-year relationships with customers and others in the industry. Second, we have specialized engineering know-how and experience gathered from designing environmental control systems for over 200 licensed, commercial cannabis cultivators. Third, we have a line of proprietary environmental control products.
 
We believe we are well positioned in the industry and, to our knowledge, are the only integrated provider of proprietary environmental control equipment and engineering serving the cannabis space. Further, we believe our employees have more experience than any other mechanical engineering firm serving this industry. Our customers engage us for their environmental and climate control systems because they want experts to design their facilities, and they come to us because of our reputation. We leverage our reputation and know-how against the local contractors and mechanical engineers who collectively constitute our largest competitors.

Our new business plan and strategy is to expand our business with our customers in two ways: (i) by offering a broader range of products and services, and (ii) by addressing a wider range of our customer needs. We believe this plan will take over two years to fully implement. The fiscal objectives of this new strategy are three-fold: (i) diversify our sales by adding recurring, and more consistent and predictable, revenue streams, (ii) achieve revenue growth at a faster rate than operating expenses, and (iii) seek to increase our gross margin by shifting our focus to value-added technology services and proprietary, customized equipment.
 
If successful, our new product and service initiatives could be “game-changers” for us by providing a more predictable, steady and recurring revenue stream as compared to our traditional one-time engineering/design/equipment projects that, while large in dollar value, were inconsistent and unpredictable and subject to licensing, permitting, funding uncertainties and other factors outside of our control. We believe our new product, service and technology offerings will be attractive to our customers and potentially represent a more consistent revenue stream to the Company.
 
Our strategy to offer more products and services to address the wider range of our customers’ needs is illustrated by the following matrix of product/service depth and facility lifecycle participation.
 

Cultivation Facility Lifecyle
 
We previously provided a one-time engineering/design and equipment package primarily in only two of the four principal phases: Pre-build and Construction. As a result, we relinquished opportunities for building longer-term relationships with existing customers and their facilities in the latter two phases: Startup and Operation. Going forward, we will attempt to become “stickier” to our customers by providing products and services across the entire 4-phase facility lifecycle. Each phase of the facility lifecycle has many activities that are opportunities for us, some of which we will pursue. We do not intend to offer products and services in all activities in each phase, but rather we will focus on those that provide value-add to our customers.
 
Pre-build. This phase includes budgeting, design options, project timelines, floorplan layout, engineering (mechanical, electrical, plumbing, irrigation), vendor management, permitting, licensing, zoning and fund raising. We intend to focus on budgeting, design, floor planning and engineering services.
 
Construction. This phase includes general contractor services, installation and construction, project management, environmental and climate control products, controls systems, controls integration, contractor management, and inspection. We intend to focus on environmental and climate control products, and control systems.

Startup. This phase includes commissioning, operator training, warranty service, facility management, facility performance monitoring, and maintenance/service contracts. Over time, we expect to be involved to some degree in all of these activities, except maintenance/service contracts.
 
Operation. This phase includes upgrades and replacements, retrofit/design, energy audit, energy efficiency improvements, and performance audits. Again, over time, we expect to be involved to some degree in all of these activities. We are currently evaluating various strategic partnerships with software, consulting and engineering firms that specialize in utility data collection, rate analysis and rebate programs and provide facility energy auditing and modeling.
 
Products and Services
 
We will also offer a deeper range of products and services than the mechanical engineering and modular chilled water systems we historically offered. This includes products and services targeting smaller indoor grow facilities that typically purchase from retailers as well as sealed greenhouse, or hybrid, facilities.
 
Services: Engineering and Design. Previously, we provided basic engineering and design work, which has steadily improved over the years as we transitioned to larger and more sophisticated commercial projects, and our reputation today reflects this reality. Going forward, we will: (i) expand and emphasize a strong internal mechanical engineering team, with our own professional engineers who have PE (licensed professional engineer) and LEED (leadership in energy and environmental design) credentials, (ii) offer energy modeling to help our customers and enhance our sales closing rate, (iii) produce engineering and design work at industry standards that general contractors expect and need, (iv) develop an engineering, design and audit services program for the expanding retrofit market, which remediates existing grow facilities that suffer from sub-optimal performance, and (v) offer a comprehensive facility management program consisting of facility/performance monitoring, upgrades, warranty, retrofits, energy and efficiency audits, data collection and analytics.
 
Our technical experience and know-how in designing indoor cannabis cultivation facilities allow us to deliver to our customers practical solutions to complicated problems in three primary areas: (i) precision climate and environmental controls, (ii) energy and water efficiency, and (iii) building code and permitting. Our engineering design typically includes all mechanical components of a climate control system: cooling and heating, dehumidification, ventilation, air sanitation and odor control. We provide load calculations, equipment specifications, and engineered systems drawings for both the cultivation and comfort cooling portions of our customers’ facilities. We also have experience in, or knowledge of, state and local permitting and code compliance for cannabis facilities in states and provinces where cannabis has been legalized for either recreational or medical use or is expected to be legalized, and we provide stamped, engineered drawings in all states and provinces where we operate.
 
Our competitive advantages are our experience and reputation. Since 2006, we have been continuously improving our facility designs which we believe distinguishes us from our competition, including local heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”) contractors, traditional HVAC design consultants, and others who may lack our cannabis-specific expertise. Indoor sealed grow facilities present a very difficult mechanical engineering challenge, and traditional mechanical engineers, without our cannabis experience, are typically unfamiliar with the precise climate and air control requirements needed for such facilities. As important, they may be unable to effectively navigate the local code and permitting rules which did not contemplate cannabis cultivation facilities when enacted. With our engineering design resources and experience, we are able to provide a code-compliant mechanical plan set in any state or province by collaborating with local regulators and our customers to come up with creative solutions that not only meet the intent of the local codes but also address concerns about the growing energy and resource usage of these facilities.
 
Energy use is, and will continue to be, a primary concern for indoor cultivators and regulators. According to industry sources, legal cannabis cultivation in the U.S. consumed an estimated 1.1 million megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity-based energy in 2017, enough to power 92,500 homes for a year. This consumption is expected to increase 162% from 2017 to 2022. The biggest components are HVAC and lighting which comprise approximately 50% and 40%, respectively, of a facility’s energy use. Unsurprisingly, after labor, energy costs represent the second highest operating cost for indoor cultivators.
 
As a result, licensed producers are adopting practices to maximize energy efficiency and thereby reduce operating costs, which will become even more important as the industry matures and wholesale prices decline. These practices include water efficiency, LED lighting, and renewable energy alternatives. Sealed greenhouses, or hybrid facilities—which are insulated for energy efficiency and combine natural light with the use of artificial lights—also provide a more economical way to grow cannabis compared to indoor production. But regardless of whether indoor or a hybrid facility is the grow medium, precise environmental controls are required to deliver consistent product quality and yield. We are currently evaluating possible strategic partnerships with greenhouse facility providers that are seeking an environmental controls partner for this specific facility application.

We believe the right solution for our cultivation customers must provide tight temperature/humidity control, reduced fungus, pollen, pesticide and insect contamination risk (“bio-security”), minimized regulatory compliance risk, and lower maintenance complexity, costs and downtime. Our bio-security program uses a combination of a sealed facility and our customized approaches to air sterilization to maintain facility standards while destroying harmful airborne microbes without the production of byproducts. Additionally, our ductless modular chilled water systems using fan coil units within each grow room, isolate the air and potential contaminants within each room, while taking advantage of the energy efficiencies and redundancies offered by such systems. Our experience has shown that our precision environmental controls can reduce the reliance on the use of harmful pesticides and fungicides. We also believe our experience in the tightly regulated Canadian market where pharmaceutical-like standards (including Good Manufacturing Practice standards) exist for filtration, air quality and post-harvest plant quality also gives us an advantage over our competitors, especially as product quality testing regulations continue to be enacted by state, provincial and local agencies.
 
These are perspectives that help conceptualize the complexity of the environmental controls systems that need to be deployed by indoor cultivators:
 

● | Lighting. Lighting demand is 70 times more energy intensive than commercial office buildings. This lighting intensity creates heat, which when combined with plant transpiration to create humidity, creates the need for dehumidification and corresponding additional energy demand. Further complicating matters, lighting schedules and density must be adjusted for the clone, vegetative and flowering stages of cannabis cultivation, and associated variances in watering rates and temperature and humidity targets, which are usually adjusted based on photoperiod. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | HVAC. HVAC energy use is driven by the need to remove the heat emitted from lighting and the moisture released during the plant’s evapotranspiration process, coupled with air circulation and odor and contaminant filtration requirements. 
● | Legacy Systems. Mechanical systems are often designed and/or installed poorly, which can increase energy consumption by up to 50%. Reasons include: (i) unlicensed cultivators deploying HVAC systems without an understanding of how HVAC control the growing environment, (ii) cultivators failing to understand the criticality of proper installation, commissioning and servicing of the equipment, even if properly designed, (iii) HVAC systems selected without understanding the interrelationship between sensible (cooling) and latent (moisture) factors, and (iv) most HVAC systems are designed for buildings for humans, not plants. 
● | High Value Crop. For an indoor 10,000-square foot plant canopy facility, and assuming a wholesale price of $1,500 per pound, a single complete cannabis crop loss (out of a typical five harvests annually) could mean lost revenue of between $600,000 to $1,800,000, with the variance depending on the cultivator’s yield efficiency, which we estimate ranges from one to three pounds per 25 square feet of plant canopy. 

 
New technologies and applications, coupled with emerging cultivation techniques, are providing opportunities for increased efficiency, which we are positioned to deliver to our customers. Our engineering and technical sales team, which currently consists of 11 people, is fully qualified and committed to delivering energy and resource efficient solutions to commercial cultivators. Leveraging their technical competence, and our customers’ increasing focus on energy efficiency, quality and yield, we intend to offer retrofit/design, energy audit, energy efficiency improvement, and performance audit services.
 
Products: Environmental Control Systems. Previously, we primarily sold modular chilled water systems. In the future, we will: (i) expand our product offering to include other HVAC solutions, such as custom air handling units, split systems, packaged roof-top units, self-contained and complex water chilled systems, (ii) complete the development of a branded, proprietary controls and monitoring offering (consisting of sensors, controllers, software, monitoring and a user interface) with the goal of eventually generating a recurring revenue stream, (iii) upgrade our proprietary equipment lines of fan coils, dehumidifiers, and chillers, and (iv) source customized, application-specific odor control and air sanitation products.
 
We believe we are a leading company in North America supplying a complete product line for environmental control and air sanitation systems for the indoor cannabis cultivation market. Since 2006, we have made it our mission to continuously expand our product line and improve the functionality of our equipment. Because of our market experience, we have gained valuable feedback and design insights from our customers, and we continue to innovate and respond as cultivation facilities have increased in both size and complexity. This experience positions us well to offer other HVAC solutions, beyond our traditional modular chilled water systems, to meet the diverse needs of our expanding customer base.

Specific Initiatives in Progress
 
Our execution plan consists of a series of inter-related initiatives, including: (i) leveraging our strong brand name, (ii) positioning and messaging “Surna as the expert” in environmental controls management; (iii) evaluating first-generation grow facilities as prospects for broader service and product offerings or retrofit work; and (iv) developing a corresponding marketing/service/product plan to address facility lifecycle revenue opportunities. The following are examples of specific product and service initiatives that we are already pursuing or assessing:
 
New Products and Services. With our engineering know-how, we have the internal resources to develop and offer more environmental control solutions, help more customers and expand our market reach without incurring significant incremental costs. We also completed a full review of our major equipment and hardware lines and have developed a line-up of new, more efficient and proprietary products that we will be rolling out over the next 18 months. We designed these products to meet the increasing demands of our customers.
 
We recently shipped various configurations of our new fan coil units to two projects with three more under contract. These Surna-branded models offer greater efficiency, design flexibility and control for growers using modular chilled water systems. Our proprietary products, such as our new fan coils, cannot be sourced elsewhere and this gives us greater pricing leverage, which we expect will result in increased margins.
 
During the second quarter of 2019, we are also planning to roll-out two standard-sized and custom air handler products, which will allow us to meet our customer needs in situations where a ducted air handler is the preferred solution as opposed to the ductless systems that we sell today.
 
We expect to be able to offer a utility rebate consulting service, beginning the second quarter of 2019, to help our new build customers obtain utility rebates. While this service is not expected to generate significant revenue, it should help us sell our environmental controls systems because our customers will be able to use these rebates to offset some of their capital costs.
 
We are also offering our new proprietary controls systems product to all new prospects.
 
Retrofit Market. While hundreds of new indoor cannabis cultivation facilities continue to be built every year, the installed base of first-generation cultivation facilities in the U.S. and Canada has grown into the thousands. Currently, we estimate there are over 3,000 existing cultivation facilities with approximately 8,000 legal cultivation licenses issued throughout the U.S. alone. As discussed above, many of these facilities have environmental control systems that control temperature, humidity, vapor pressure deficit, and CO2, but were designed by mechanical engineers who lacked cannabis application-specific expertise, which is precisely what we have. Some of these facilities are now facing serious operational challenges maintaining the required indoor growing conditions, which may lead to large dollar crop loss, uneven product consistency and quality, and reduced yields. The industry is beginning to recognize the need for our specialized know-how and experience, and we plan to initiate a targeted outreach strategy to the operators of these first-generation facilities. Our facility retrofit projects present an expanded market opportunity for us beyond our typical new facility projects, which carry uncertainties associated with prospect identification, licensing, permitting and funding.
 
We recently completed a retrofit consulting project—the first of its kind for us—for a large, multi-facility cultivator, and thereafter received a $1,000,000+ order to supply equipment to several of their cultivation facilities that have been operating ineffectively. This order is expected to be fulfilled, and the revenue recognized, in the second or third quarter of 2019.
 
By the third quarter of 2019, we expect to further refine our retrofit offering for first-generation grow facilities. We are internally developing a facility assessment, analysis and consulting service to assist existing facilities in solving their environmental controls challenges.
 
Sensors, Controls and Automation Business. In late 2018, we decided to focus our next major product initiative in the sensors, controls and automation (“SCA”) market. This is an important initiative for us for several reasons, from tactical to strategic. Cultivation facilities must have SCA to operate their HVAC equipment. In simple form, SCA is the thermostat in the room, with the occupant selecting the desired temperature set point, the wall thermostat (Sensor) detecting the actual temperature, and when the space temperature deviates from the desired set point the thermostat (Control) commands the furnace or air-conditioner to supply heated or cooled air to bring the room temperature back to the set point. In the case of the cultivation facilities that we serve, there are more environmental conditions to monitor and control (such as temperature, relative humidity, CO2, lighting, system status, and more) than in a typical residential home.
 
Indoor cannabis growers also need to vary the environmental conditions depending on stage of plant growth (i.e., clone, vegetative and flowering stages of cannabis cultivation), time of day, and plant maturity. In a cultivation facility the desired conditions change many times during the plant’s growth cycle and even within a day, and this is most easily accomplished with a programmable environmental control system (Automation), not unlike a simple programmable thermostat in a home.

We have entered this business to satisfy our customer’s needs that we did not previously address and that historically was provided by third-party controls contractors. Our entry into the SCA market helps both our customer’s and our business. We are also advantageously positioned to offer SCA products because we will be one of the few mechanical systems providers in the market to offer both a branded, proprietary HVAC equipment package as well as a branded SCA product line. Our customers benefit because they are saved the extra work of finding and engaging a controls contractor, allowing them to get their facility up and running more quickly by taking one decision off the table and thereby establishing a single point of responsibility for controls implementation. We are also in a strong position to provide SCA because we know our proprietary equipment better than anyone, thereby ensuring smooth integration with our equipment products with no work scope shortcomings. Longer term, our customers will benefit by having us remotely monitor the status of the HVAC equipment in the facility, thereby avoiding potential catastrophic problems, up to and including total crop loss, as well as using artificial intelligence (AI) to aggregate environment and growing data for our customers to optimize energy use, operating efficiency, and product quality and yield.
 
From a tactical perspective, with limited incremental selling costs, our current sales team is positioned to offer our SCA package to nearly every prospect since every cultivation facility must have SCA technology. We believe this technology value-added solution gives us an opportunity to achieve incremental project revenue at margins above those of our traditional equipment product lines. Strategically, through our SCA package, we are also able to deepen our ongoing relationship with the customer which positions us for a long-term customer relationship by tethering us to the customer through a controls interface (dashboard) to their facility. Additionally, it positions us as a broad range provider of environmental control products and facility management services for the total lifecycle of the cultivation facility. While there are several other total controls systems providers, we believe that our industry know-how, experience and reputation will give us a compelling and competitive SCA offering.
 
We will sell Surna-branded precision sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels, which are more accurate than typical HVAC sensors and are able to report within tighter tolerance levels. Our controllers will be purpose-built computers programmed by us to ensure our industrial environmental control equipment follows the engineered sequences of operation to obtain desired setpoints. Our sensors connect to our branded controllers through wires installed in the facility, and similarly they are wired to our HVAC equipment (e.g., chillers, fan coils and dehumidifiers) to direct these pieces of equipment. The controllers also provide a user interface on a screen so that they can be programmed and controlled to achieve the customer’s environmental objectives, and the cultivator may also assess this data and react to alerts remotely.
 
We will be launching our SCA offering on April 2, 2019 at the Technology Pavilion of the Cannabis Conference in Las Vegas. Similar to the timing of our equipment offering, completion of the SCA portion of our sales contract will be subject to factors beyond our control and may take between six months to two years to be fully deployed following contract execution. While we have no project contracts that include our SCA offerings at this time, we have begun budgeting and quoting SCA systems with existing prospects and have recently presented quotes to about 10 potential customers. We also have a beta-site customer that has agreed to install our SCA products at one of their cultivation facilities.
 
Beginning in the second half of 2019, we believe that we will be able to sell our SCA package in at least 25% of our engineering/design/equipment projects, with that percentage increasing over time. More specifically, we hope to complete the installation of our branded SCA product in at least four projects in 2019. Additionally, our SCA package can be sold to most existing facilities on a retrofit basis.
 
One-off Strategic Alliances. We are also in the process of identifying and assessing one-off strategic alliances (e.g., joint ventures, co-marketing, distribution) that are low cost/low risk, easy to implement and execute, can leverage our brand recognition in the cannabis space, expand the offerings that our sales team can present to our past, present and future commercial cannabis cultivators and, most importantly, generate additional revenues and margins, with little incremental costs. We are currently in preliminary discussion with several potential strategic partners that offer a wide range of complimentary products and services, such as energy-efficient lighting, processing equipment, and cloud-based data aggregation and Artificial Intelligence platforms, which we can refer our customers because we are engaged at the early Pre-build phase.
 
There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute any of these initiatives, or identify, test and develop new and improved products or services, or that such new products or services will generate revenue or profitability at the levels we expect. At this time, our efforts will be primarily focused on working with current and new strategic partners to jointly develop new and improved products and services with cannabis-specific applications, as opposed to seeking acquisitions.

Marketing 
 
New Construction Market Opportunities Follow Legislation
 
The demand for our environmental control systems currently is primarily driven by the construction of new cannabis cultivation facilities in the U.S. and Canada. New construction activity is, in turn, driven by state legislation approving either medical or recreational cannabis use. Recent regulatory changes involving medical and/or recreational cannabis use in various jurisdictions, such as California, Michigan, Oklahoma, Utah, Missouri and Canada, tend to be a leading indicator for the granting of licenses for new facility construction. As more new cultivation facilities become licensed, we in turn have an expanded set of potential customers that might buy our environmental control systems. However, since both medical and recreational cannabis use remains prohibited under U.S. federal law, uncertainty continues and tends to unfavorably impact the development and financing of new cannabis cultivation facilities in the U.S.

● | In the U.S., a total of 33 states (and the District of Columbia) have legalized the medical use of cannabis for over 60 qualifying conditions. Following last year’s mid-term elections, 10 states (and D.C.), with more than 50% of the U.S. population, have legalized access to cannabis for recreational use. With increasing consumer acceptance of cannabis and the growth of the industry as a whole, we believe the number of states that allow cannabis use is set to jump even higher in 2019. Consider the following data gathered from various industry sources and publications: In the U.S., over 24 million persons, or 9.9% of adults age 18 and over consume cannabis regularly, and 115 million persons (or 48%) report having consumed it at some point in their lifetimes. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In states where cannabis is currently legal, sales of medical and recreational cannabis are forecast to grow from $12.9 billion in 2019 to $26.3 billion in 2025. 
● | There were 2.4 million registered U.S. medical cannabis patients in 2018, up 71% since 2014. 

 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we booked sales orders for 32 new build projects, each with a contract value over $100,000, which we refer to as commercial-scale projects. This compares to 20 and 18 commercial-scale projects booked for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The California and Canadian markets continued to be strong in 2018. Despite our increased bookings for new commercial-scale projects in 2018, the timing for completion of these projects is largely dependent on customer-centric factors—outside of our control—such as industry uncertainty, project financing concerns, and the licensing and qualification of our prospective customers. Further, the increased complexity and size of our new projects also impacts the timing of completion, with larger projects typically taking more time to complete.
 
In 2018, the average contract value for our commercial-scale project bookings was $408,000 compared to $332,000 for 2017. During 2018, we also booked sales orders with a large, multi-state customer that has put on hold two projects in states where the current market conditions, including wholesale cannabis prices, are not favorable. We estimate that these two projects will not be completed within the next 24 months, and it is possible that they may be abandoned by our customer.
 
The following table sets forth our commercial-scale project bookings, based on the year the contract was executed and we received an initial deposit, by country/state.

Our marketing efforts during 2019 will be targeted at owner/operators, investors and companies that are actively seeking licenses to produce cannabis in California, Michigan, Missouri, Oklahoma, Utah and Pennsylvania. These represent the largest markets, based on the state and local regulatory framework, for our products and services. In particular, Pennsylvania and Oklahoma require indoor growing, and Missouri is expected to issue cultivation licenses in 2019. However, as and when new states pass legislation, we will shift our priorities and/or add new salespeople to pursue new facility construction at the early stage.

Marketing and Selling Our Expanded Product and Service Offering 
 
Our marketing and sales efforts in 2019 and beyond will be diversified into three vectors: (i) new commercial build projects, (ii) existing commercial retrofit projects, and (iii) retail sales.
 
New commercial build projects are our traditional market, where we provide engineering and/or environmental control products for new cannabis grow facilities. We will continue to pursue such projects with an expanded product and service offering, which we expect will increase our average project size and target margins. While we intend to reduce our trade show presence and expenditures, we are enhancing our outreach with a new marketing methodology which will consist of a new customer-aligned messaging and positioning platform that we believe will increase our lead generation for new projects, and in turn allow our sales force to more effectively convert these leads to new contract bookings.
 
Our direct salespeople are primarily focused on new (and soon, existing) commercial project sales (typically in excess of 4,000 square feet of plant canopy, although some may be smaller) with each covering a specific geographical territory:
 

● | the Northeast region (which includes eastern Canada, and the U.S. East Coast); 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the Pacific Northwest region (which includes Washington, Oregon, Alaska and western Canada); 
● | the West Coast region (which currently includes all of California); and 
● | the Midwest region (which includes Michigan). 

 
We currently do not have a salesperson in our Pacific Northwest sales territory, but we intend to fill this position in the second quarter of 2019. We also intend to expand our sales force as our resources allow.
 
Existing commercial retrofit projects represent a new opportunity that we have just begun to address. The estimated 3,000+ existing commercial grow facilities in North America are easier to identify than new build projects. We believe, based on evidence and our market knowledge, that some of these exiting facilities have environmental control problems that we can help remediate. We also believe that the energy consumption of these facilities can be reduced, and we are developing services and products to help them realize savings. We have a full product and service offering in mind, but we expect that the roll-out will take up to two years. However, to expedite this roll-out, we are evaluating possible strategic partners that could add products and services that are an immediate value-add to our customers.
 
Over the last several years, we deemphasized our wholesale efforts to the hydroponic retail stores network while we focused on building our commercial business. However, over time, as we add new products that can be sold at retail, such as fans, dehumidifiers, and nutrient cooling systems, we intend to make a more focused effort on marketing to the major retail chains that serve the cannabis cultivator market. By the third quarter of 2019, we except to develop a retail store sales and marketing strategy to leverage our growing product line, which we expect to fully implement by 2020.
 
Industry Presence
 
Our marketing outreach is conducted through three primary channels: magazine advertisement, our website, and industry trade shows.
 
Magazine Advertisement. We regularly advertise in major industry trade publications such as Cannabis Business Times, Cannabis Tech, Grow Opportunity (Canada), Grow Magazine (Canada), Marijuana Venture, and MJBiz Daily. Over time, we believe such advertisements have proven to be an effective business development tool.
 
Website. Our website is a consistent source of productive leads. We are currently revamping our website consistent with our new marketing methodology and expect that an update will be deployed in the second quarter of 2019.
 
Trade Shows. We regularly display at industry trade shows and conventions and conduct speaking engagements to achieve industry visibility and presence cost-effectively. In the past, we have attended most major trade and industry conventions including Lift Expo (Vancouver), CannaCon (Seattle), Cannabis Cultivation (Oakland), Lift Expo (Toronto), NCIA Cannabis Business Summit (San Jose), Cannabis World Congress & Business Expo (Los Angeles), CCIA/NCIA California Cannabis Business Conference (Anaheim) and the Marijuana Business Conference & Expo (Las Vegas), plus some smaller regional shows.
 
Several of our senior technical advisors and sales people also speak on climate control and energy efficiency at events sponsored by organizations such as National Cannabis Industry Association, Cannabis World Congress and Business Exposition and CannaCon and LIFT Vancouver and Toronto. These advisors and sales people are also frequently cited in industry-related publications. Our co-founder, Brandy Keen is also a member of Denver’s Department of Public Health and Environment Cannabis Sustainability Work Group, whose mission is to promote sustainability in the cannabis industry through education, the development and dissemination of best practices, and the facilitation of dialogue between the cannabis industry, the community, and technical experts. Ms. Keen was also acknowledged as a contributor to the 2018 Cannabis Energy Report published by New Frontier Data, a leading cannabis industry publisher.

We are a part of the Founder’s Circle of Resource Innovations Institute (“RII”), with Ms. Keen being a member of their technical advisory committee. RII promotes and quantifies energy and water conservation in the cannabis industry. As a result of our Founder’s Circle status, we have access to RII’s data as well as speaking position opportunities at their seminars.
 
These programs give us industry exposure and allow us to showcase our experience in environment management for cannabis cultivation. With many new participants in the cannabis cultivation industry, we will also be able to provide existing and prospective customers with access to a Colorado-licensed indoor cultivation facility managed by Stephen Keen, one of our co-founders, for demonstration tours in a working indoor grow environment, which we believe may assist us in the sale of our products and services in the future. We also have a technical test and demonstration facility in our building where we are developing and refining our controls products.
 
New Facility Sales Cycle and Risks
 
The sales cycles for our new build commercial projects can vary significantly. From pre-sales and technical advisory meetings to sales contract execution, to engineering and design services and equipment delivery, and all the way through installation and commissioning of the installed system, the full cycle can range from six months to two years. Since we do not install the climate control systems, our customers are required to use third-party installation contractors, which adds to the variability of the sales cycle.
 
The length of our sales cycle for new facilities is driven by numerous factors including:
 

● | the large number of first-time participants interested in the indoor cannabis cultivation business; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the complexities and uncertainties involved in obtaining state and local licensure and permitting; 
● | local and state government delays in approving licenses and permits due to lack of staff or the large number of pending applications, especially in states where there is no cap on the number of cultivators; 
● | the customer’s need to obtain cultivation facility financing; 
● | the time needed, and coordination required, for our customers to acquire real estate and properly design and build the facility (to the stage when climate control systems can be installed); 
● | the large price tag and technical complexities of the climate control and air sanitation system; 
● | availability of power; and 
● | delays that are typical in completing any commercial construction project. 

 
Based on the foregoing factors, there are risks that we may not realize the full contract value of our backlog in a timely manner, or at all. The performance of our obligations under a sales contract, and the timing of our revenue recognition, is dependent upon our customers’ ability to secure funding and real estate, obtain a license and then build their cultivation facility so they can take possession of the equipment. Our sales contracts currently are not time specific as to when our customers are required to take delivery of our services and equipment. More recently, we determined that some of our new construction facility projects are becoming larger and more complex and, as a result, delays were more likely due to licensing and permitting, lack of or delay in funding, staged facility construction, and/or the shifting priorities of certain customers with multiple facility projects in progress at one time. In order to address these risks, the obligations under these sales contracts are generally allocated into the following types of deliverables, and we typically require non-refundable payments from our customers in advance of our performance of services or delivery of equipment. However, in certain situations, especially as we expand our products and services offering for a customer’s entire facility lifecycle (i.e., beyond Pre-build and Construction phases), we may extend credit to our customers in which case we are at risk for the collection of account receivables.
 
Engineering Services. First, we provide our customer with engineering and design services and drawings. In many cases, the engineering phase is done as part of the license application or building permit process and takes approximately six to eight weeks to complete. Our strategy is to secure the sales contract and commence the engineering and design portion of the project early in the customer’s planning phase of the project. This is important for a number of reasons: (i) we can assist our customers with their engineering and design plans as part of their licensing application process as well as better assure the customer has the right-sized equipment for their application, leading to a higher probability of a successful grow, (ii) we are better positioned to utilize our proprietary equipment for the project at an earlier stage, and (iii) we are able to help reduce a customer’s time to market. Before we commence the engineering phase of the project, we will generally require an advanced payment intended to cover the engineering value of the contract.
 
Surna Manufactured Equipment. Upon completion of the engineering and design phase, it may take our customer on average six to 12 months to complete the facility build-out, with possible delays due to financing or other aspects which are beyond our control as discussed above. Customer delays in obtaining financing and completing facility build-out make the completion timing of our sales contract unpredictable. For this reason, we require an additional advance payment before we begin manufacturing our proprietary equipment items.

Third-Party Manufactured Equipment. The final phase of our contract typically involves the delivery of third-party manufactured equipment items and other equipment to complete the project. We typically will not deliver until we receive a final advance payment for the remaining contract value. After the project is completed and the environmental control system has been fully installed by third-party installation contractors, we will deploy our technicians to the customer’s cultivation facility to “commission” the system. Commissioning involves testing that the equipment has been properly assembled and installed by the installation contractor and assuring the equipment is operating within the agreed specifications.
 
Given the timing of the deliverables of our sales contracts, we often have experienced large variances in quarterly revenue. Our revenue recognition is dependent upon shipment of the equipment portions of our sales contracts, which, in many cases, may be delayed while our customers complete permitting, prepare their facilities for equipment installation or obtain project financing.
 
Competition
 
Our environmental control systems and our related engineering and design services compete with various national and local HVAC contractors and traditional HVAC equipment suppliers who traditionally resell, design, and implement climate control systems for commercial and industrial facilities, most of whom do not have the specific knowledge that we have about the complexities and challenges of cannabis cultivation. We have positioned ourselves to differ from these competitors by providing engineering and design services and environmental control systems, across all HVAC solutions, including modular chilled water systems, custom air handling units, split systems, packaged roof-top units, and self-contained and complex chilled-water systems, each tailored specifically for managing the distinct challenges involved in indoor cannabis cultivation. We believe our cannabis-specific applications and experience in this market allow us to deliver the right solution to our cultivation customers. Unlike many of our competitors, our solutions are designed specifically for cultivators to provide tight temperature/humidity control, reduce bio-security risk, reduce energy requirements, and minimize maintenance complexity, costs and downtime. However, as the legal cannabis market continues to grow, we expect increased competition in both the climate control systems and engineering services with some of these competitors attempting to emulate our cannabis specific-application model.
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent and trademark rights, trade secrets, laws that protect intellectual property, confidentiality procedures, and contractual restrictions with our employees and others to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We have several pending patent applications, which include a combination of Patent Cooperation Treaty, utility and design patent applications that are directed to certain of our technologies. We have registered trademark registrations around our core Surna brand (“Surna”) in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions, as well as the Surna logo and the combined Surna logo and name in the United States. Our wordmark is also registered in the European Union and Canada. Subject to ongoing use and renewal, trademark protection is potentially perpetual.
Employees
 
We currently have 25 full-time employees. However, we may engage, and have in the past utilized, the services of a number of consultants, independent contractors, and other non-employee professionals. Additional employees may be hired in the future depending on need, available resources, and our achieved growth.
Government Regulation
 
The use, possession, cultivation, and distribution of marijuana is prohibited by U.S. federal law for medical and recreational purposes. Although certain states have legalized medical and recreational cannabis, companies and individuals involved in the sector are still at risk of being prosecuted by federal authorities. Further, the landscape in the cannabis industry changes rapidly. This means that at any time the city, county, or state where cannabis is permitted can change the current laws and/or the federal government can supersede those laws and take prosecutorial action. Given the uncertain legal nature of the cannabis industry, it is imperative that investors understand that investments in the cannabis industry should be considered very high risk. A change in the current laws or enforcement policy can negatively affect the status and operation of our business, require additional fees, stricter operational guidelines and unanticipated shut-downs.
 
See the “Risks Related to the Cannabis Industry” set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report which addresses various risks related to U.S. and foreign regulation and enforcement of cannabis laws and regulations and their potential impact on our business.
