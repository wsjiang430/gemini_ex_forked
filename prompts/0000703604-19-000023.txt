ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Lawson Products, Inc. (“Lawson”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) was incorporated in Illinois in 1952, and reincorporated in Delaware in 1982. Lawson serves the industrial, commercial, institutional and government Maintenance, Repair and Operations ("MRO") market. 
Vision
Our vision is to be our customers' first choice for maintenance, repair and operational solutions that improve their operating performance. We plan to achieve our vision by working closely with our customers to maintain and enhance their operations by providing them with quality products, superior service and innovative solutions. 
Industry and Competition
The MRO industrial distribution industry is comprised of companies that buy and stock products in bulk and supply these products to customers on an as needed basis. The customer benefits from our knowledge and the convenience of ordering smaller quantities maintained by MRO suppliers. We estimate that total annual revenue generated by the North American MRO marketplace exceeds $130 billion. 
There is a significant amount of competitive fragmentation by geography and product within the industry. We encounter competition from several national distributors and manufacturers and a large number of regional and local distributors. Some competitors have greater financial and personnel resources, handle more extensive lines of merchandise, operate larger facilities and price some merchandise more competitively than we do. 
Segments
With the acquisition of The Bolt Supply House Ltd. ("Bolt") in 2017, we now operate in two reportable segments, the Lawson operating segment and the Bolt operating segment.
Lawson Segment
Through the Lawson operating segment, we deliver quality products to our customers and offer them extensive product knowledge, product application expertise and Vendor Managed Inventory ("VMI") services. Our broad geographic sales coverage allows us to serve large multi-location customers. We compete for business primarily by offering a value-added service approach in which our highly trained sales representatives manage the product inventory for our customers. The VMI model makes it less likely that our customers will unintentionally run out of a product while optimizing their inventory levels. 
Sales orders are primarily generated from our sales representatives; however, customers can also order directly from our website or through our customer service team via fax or phone. We ship products to customers in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. We normally ship to our customers within one day of order placement. 
Our MRO distribution process normally entails the purchase of product from suppliers in bulk for delivery to our packaging and distribution facility in McCook, Illinois (“McCook Facility”) for possible repackaging, labeling or cross-docking. Product is then either stocked at the McCook Facility or delivered to one of our strategically located distribution centers. As orders are received, product is picked, packed and shipped to our customers. Many factors affect the efficiency of this process including the physical design of the distribution centers, routing logistics, the number of times the product needs to be handled, transportation costs and the flexibility to meet the specific requirements of our customers.
On October 1, 2018 we acquired Screw Products, Inc. ("SPI"), a regional distributor of bulk industrial products to large manufacturers and job shops. SPI, with revenues of less than 1% of the Company's total revenues, will be reported as part of the Lawson MRO reporting segment.

Bolt Segment
The Bolt operating segment primarily delivers products to its customers through 14 branches located in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and British Columbia, Canada. Bolt generates sales from walk up business at its branch locations and through its sales team, phone, fax or the Internet. Bolt inventory is delivered to the packaging and distribution facility in Calgary, Alberta, and then distributed to each branch location. Sales generated via its sales team or through phone, fax or Internet orders are primarily shipped from one of the branch locations to the customer. The majority of Bolt's customers are located in the geographic vicinity of the retail branches. Bolt generally does not offer VMI service to its customers. Bolt generated 10.5% of the Company's annual 2018 sales. Bolt product offerings are listed on the Bolt website and are available in each of the retail branch locations. 
Purchased inventory is delivered to the packaging and distribution center in Calgary, Alberta. Based on forecasted demand, product is picked, packed and shipped to the branch locations where the product is available for sale to customers.
Smaller Company Reporting Status
In 2018 the SEC revised the requirements to be qualified as a smaller reporting company. The Company meets the revised smaller reporting company requirements, and elected to be classified as a smaller reporting company. The Company will report its results in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in accordance with the smaller reporting company requirements and in its reports filed with the SEC going forward. 
Customers
During 2018, the Lawson segment sold products to over 71,000 identified customers and the Bolt segment sold products to over 11,000 identified customers in addition to the walk up customers at its 14 branch locations. Our largest customer accounted for approximately three percent of net sales. In 2018, approximately 80% of our net sales were generated in the United States and approximately 20% in Canada. The percentage of sales in Canada increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the ownership of Bolt for an entire year. Our customers operate in a variety of industries including automotive repair, commercial vehicle maintenance, government, manufacturing, food processing, distribution, construction, oil and gas, mining, wholesale, service and others. Although seasonality is not significant in our business, due to fewer selling days during the holiday season, net sales in the fourth quarter are historically slightly lower than the first three quarters of the year.
Our customers include a wide range of purchasers of industrial supply products from small repair shops to large national and governmental accounts. Historically, we have been very effective selling to and servicing small and medium sized customer locations that value our service approach. 
Products
Our product offerings are listed on our websites and in catalogs distributed to our customers. Sales percentages by broad product categories of our product mix in 2018 were as follows:

Product Category | Percentage
Fastening systems | 24% 
Cutting tools and abrasives | 15% 
Fluid power | 14% 
Specialty chemicals | 12% 
Electrical | 11% 
Aftermarket automotive supplies | 8% 
Safety | 5% 
Welding and metal repair | 2% 
Other | 9% 
 | 100% 

The Lawson segment offers over 160,000 different products for sale of which over 72,000 products are maintained in our distribution centers. We strive to carry sufficient inventory to ensure product availability and rapid processing of customer orders. Accurate forecasting of customer demand is essential to establish the proper level of inventory for each product. Inventory levels need to be sufficient to meet customer demand while avoiding the costs of stocking excess items.

During 2018, our Lawson segment purchased products from approximately 2,500 suppliers and no single supplier accounted for more than six percent of our purchases. The loss of one of our core suppliers could affect our operations by hindering our ability to provide full service to our customers.
Our quality control department tests our product offerings to ensure they meet our customers' specifications. We recommend solutions to help customers maximize product performance and avoid costly product failures. Our engineering department provides technical support for our products and offers on-site problem solutions. It also develops and presents product safety and technical training seminars tailored to meet our customers' needs. Safety Data Sheets are maintained electronically and are available to our customers on our website. 
Bolt offers over 36,000 different core products for sale of which over 19,000 products are maintained in the Calgary distribution center. The majority of inventory is kept in the Calgary distribution center, with each retail branch maintaining appropriate inventory levels for their business needs. 
Employees 
Our organization supports a culture of continuous improvement and emphasizes the importance of addressing the needs of our customers. We require our employees to act with integrity in every aspect of our business while encouraging them to be results driven, team oriented and progressive. 
On December 31, 2018, our combined workforce included approximately 1,740 individuals, comprised of approximately 1,230 in sales and marketing, approximately 400 in operation and distribution and approximately 110 in management and administration. Approximately 1,610 of the 1,740 individuals are within the Lawson segment and the remaining are within Bolt. Approximately 9% of the workforce is covered by three collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees and their collective bargaining organizations are good. 
Sales Team
On December 31, 2018, the Lawson sales and marketing team consisted of approximately 1,230 individuals focused on servicing existing customers, identifying new customers, providing customer service support and providing on-site customer service. Of the total sales team, 994 are sales representatives who are primarily organized into geographical regions. The performance of each region is the responsibility of a Regional Sales Director. Each region is further divided into geographically defined districts. The performance of each district is the responsibility of a District Sales Manager who reports to the Regional Sales Director. Our District Sales Managers work with the sales representatives to generate sales from new and existing customers. Lawson also has a team dedicated to the acquisition of larger national and mid-market accounts and a team dedicated to serving governmental accounts. The national accounts are comprised of multi-location customers with a national scope.
The Lawson sales team receives education in the best uses of products, enabling them to provide customized solutions to address customers' needs including technical expertise and on-site problem resolution. The VMI services Lawson offers consist of managing customers' inventory, ordering the right products in the optimal quantity and stocking the product for customers when the product is delivered. The sales team also periodically provides product presentations to customers that are designed to demonstrate how the products can improve their productivity. Additionally, Lawson sales representatives offer customized storage systems for improved organization and a more efficient work-flow. 
The majority of Bolt sales are made from its 14 branch locations. Bolt has approximately 30 sales territory managers who serve companies and professional tradespeople throughout Western Canada. In 2017, Bolt began requiring members of the sales teams to be certified as Certified Sales Professionals for the Canadian Professional Sales Association. All newly-hired sales team members are required to receive and maintain the same certification. 
Strategic Focus
In 2019, we intend to grow our sales organically and through acquisitions and further improve our operations to make Lawson our customers' first choice for products, services and solutions that improve their operating performance. 
Our sales are impacted by the size of our sales team and its territorial coverage. Our plan to expand the sales force is designed to identify under served territories that offer the greatest potential growth opportunity, locate and recruit talented sales representatives, provide them with the proper training, and successfully integrate them into our organization.

To acquire the best new sales talent and prepare them for success, we have developed an extensive talent acquisition strategy. We use both internal and external resources to identify and recruit the best available sales talent. Our training program is intended to provide new sales representatives with the tools they need to maximize their sales potential. As we increase our sales coverage, we anticipate a short-term decrease in average sales per day per sales representative, as new representatives build up customer relationships in their territories. However, we believe that these short-term investments will result in future opportunities as we leverage the positive impact of top-line growth against our operating costs which are fixed to a significant extent.
We are also focused on increasing the productivity of our sales representatives. We strive to empower our sales representatives with the training, technology and support they need to maximize their sales potential while providing our customers with superior service and making it easy for them to do business with us. 
In addition to organic growth, we plan to continue to actively pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe are financially accretive to our organization. As with Bolt and SPI, Lawson will continue to explore growth opportunities in the MRO space that provide different channels to reach customers, increase sales and generate positive results. 
In order to improve our operations, we utilize a Lean Six Sigma approach, which is a set of tools that allow a project team to analyze and improve selected business processes. The project teams work with the process owners to develop statistical measures to evaluate the effectiveness of the process, document the current components and process flow, examine the root cause of defects 
and effect of current operations, design and implement new ways to improve performance and then measure the results for effectiveness. The Lean Six Sigma process is ingrained in our culture as we have had over 100 employees complete Lean Six Sigma training over the past four years and plan to continue this training program in the years to come. 
 We believe our emphasis on continuous improvement will lead to further reductions in error rates, increased processing speed, reduction in cycle times, standardization of procedures and elimination of waste. This will enable us to become a more efficient and effective organization which provides our customers with the best purchasing experience possible.
