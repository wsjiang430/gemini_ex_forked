Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Our Company
 We are one of the largest integrated equipment services companies in the United States focused on heavy construction and industrial equipment. We rent, sell and provide parts and services support for four core categories of specialized equipment: (1) hi-lift or aerial work platform equipment; (2) cranes; (3) earthmoving equipment; and (4) industrial lift trucks. We engage in five principal business activities in these equipment categories:

• | equipment rentals;
--+-------------------


• | new equipment sales;
--+---------------------


• | used equipment sales;
--+----------------------


• | parts sales; and
--+-----------------


• | repair and maintenance services.
--+---------------------------------

 By providing rental, sales, parts, repair and maintenance functions under one roof, we offer our customers a one-stop solution for their equipment needs. This full-service approach provides us with (1) multiple points of customer contact; (2) cross-selling opportunities among our rental, new and used equipment sales, parts sales and services operations; (3) an effective method to manage our rental fleet through efficient maintenance and profitable distribution of used equipment; and (4) a mix of business activities that enables us to operate effectively throughout economic cycles. We believe that the operating experience and extensive infrastructure we have developed throughout our history as an integrated equipment services company provide us with a competitive advantage over rental-focused companies and equipment distributors. In addition, our focus on four core categories of heavy construction and industrial equipment enables us to offer specialized knowledge and support to our customers.
 We have operated, through our predecessor companies, as an integrated equipment services company for approximately 58 years and have built an extensive infrastructure that as of February 14, 2019 includes 96 full-service facilities located throughout the West Coast, Intermountain, Southwest, Gulf Coast, Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Our management, from the corporate level down to the branch store level, has extensive industry experience. We focus our rental and sales activities on, and organize our personnel principally by, our four core equipment categories. We believe this allows us to provide specialized equipment knowledge, improve the effectiveness of our rental and sales forces and strengthen our customer relationships. In addition, we operate our day-to-day business on a branch basis, which we believe allows us to more closely service our customers, fosters management accountability at local levels and strengthens our local and regional relationships.
 Products and Services
 Equipment Rentals. We rent our heavy construction and industrial equipment to our customers on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. We have a well-maintained rental fleet that, at December 31, 2018, consisted of approximately 40,542 pieces of equipment having an original acquisition cost (which we define as the cost originally paid to manufacturers or the original amount financed under operating leases) of approximately $1.76 billion and an average age of approximately 34.5 months. Our rental business creates cross-selling opportunities for us in sales and service support activities.
 New Equipment Sales. We sell new heavy construction and industrial equipment in all four core equipment categories, and are a leading U.S. distributor for nationally recognized suppliers including JLG Industries, Gehl, Genie Industries (Terex), Komatsu, and Doosan/Bobcat. In addition, we are the world’s largest distributor of Grove and Manitowoc crane equipment. Our new equipment sales operation is a source of new customers for our parts sales and service support activities, as well as for used equipment sales.
 Used Equipment Sales. We sell used equipment primarily from our rental fleet, as well as inventoried equipment that we acquire through trade-ins from our customers and selective purchases of high-quality used equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 89.6% of our used equipment sales revenues were derived from sales of rental fleet equipment. Used equipment sales, like new equipment sales, generate parts and services business for us.
 Parts Sales. We sell new and used parts to customers and also provide parts to our own rental fleet. We maintain an extensive in-house parts inventory in order to provide timely parts and service support to our customers as well as to our own rental fleet. In addition, our parts operations enable us to maintain a high-quality rental fleet and provide additional product support to our end users.
 4


Service Support. We provide maintenance and repair services for our customers’ owned equipment and to our own rental fleet. In addition to repair and maintenance on an as-needed or scheduled basis, we provide ongoing preventative maintenance services and warranty repairs for our customers. We devote significant resources to training our technical service employees and over time, we have built a full-scale services infrastructure that we believe would be difficult for companies without the requisite resources and lead time to effectively replicate.
 In addition to our principal business activities mentioned above, we provide ancillary equipment support activities including transportation, hauling, parts shipping and loss damage waivers.
 Industry Background
 Although there has been some consolidation within the industry in recent years, including the acquisitions of Rental Services Corporation, NES Rentals and Neff Corporation by United Rentals, Inc. (“URI”), the U.S. construction equipment distribution industry remains highly fragmented and consists mainly of a small number of multi-location regional or national operators and a large number of relatively small, independent businesses serving discrete local markets. The industry is driven by a broad range of economic factors including total U.S. non-residential construction trends, construction machinery demand, demand for rental equipment and additional, region-specific factors. Construction equipment is largely distributed to end users through two channels: equipment rental companies and equipment dealers. Examples of equipment rental companies include URI, Sunbelt Rentals, and Hertz Equipment Rental. Examples of equipment dealers include Finning and Toromont. Unlike many of these companies, which principally focus on one channel of distribution, we operate substantially in both channels. As an integrated equipment services company, we rent, sell and provide parts and services support. Although many of the historically pure equipment rental companies also provide parts and service support to customers, their service offerings are typically limited and may prove difficult to expand due to the infrastructure, training and resources necessary to develop the breadth of offerings and depth of specialized equipment knowledge that our services and sales staff provides.
Our Competitive Strengths
 Integrated Platform of Products and Services. We believe that our operating experience and the extensive infrastructure we have developed through years of operating as an integrated equipment services company provides us with a competitive advantage over rental-focused companies and equipment distributors. Key strengths of our integrated equipment services platform include:

• | ability to strengthen customer relationships by providing a full-range of products and services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | purchasing power gained through purchases for our new equipment sales and rental operations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | high quality rental fleet supported by our strong product support capabilities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established retail sales network resulting in profitable disposal of our used equipment; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mix of business activities that enables us to effectively operate through economic cycles.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Complementary, High Margin Parts and Services Operations. Our parts and services businesses allow us to maintain our rental fleet in excellent condition and to offer our customers high-quality rental equipment. Our after-market parts and services businesses together provide us with a high-margin revenue source that has proven to be relatively stable throughout a range of economic cycles.
 High-Quality, Multipurpose Fleet. Our focus on four core types of heavy construction and industrial equipment allows us to better provide the specialized knowledge and support that our customers demand when renting and purchasing equipment. These four types of equipment are attractive because they have a long useful life, high residual value and generally strong industry demand.
 Well-Developed Infrastructure. We have built an infrastructure that as of February 14, 2019 included a network of 96 full-service facilities in 22 states. Our workforce included, as of December 31, 2018, a highly-skilled group of approximately 511 service technicians and an aggregate of 284 sales people in our specialized rental and equipment sales forces. We believe that our well-developed infrastructure helps us to better serve large multi-regional customers than our historically rental-focused competitors and provides an advantage when competing for lucrative fleet and project management business as well as the ability to quickly capitalize on new opportunities.
 Leading Distributor for Suppliers. We are a leading U.S. distributor for nationally-recognized equipment suppliers, including JLG Industries, Gehl, Genie Industries (Terex), Komatsu and Doosan/Bobcat. In addition, we are the world’s largest distributor of Grove and Manitowoc crane equipment. These relationships improve our ability to negotiate equipment acquisition pricing and allow us to purchase parts at wholesale costs.

Customized Information Technology Systems. Our information systems allow us to actively manage our business and our rental fleet. We have a customer relationship management system that provides our sales force with real-time access to customer and sales information. In addition, our enterprise resource planning system enhances our ability to provide more timely and meaningful information to manage our business.
 Strong Customer Relationships. We have a diverse base of approximately 41,600 customers as of December 31, 2018 who we believe value our high level of service, knowledge and expertise. Our customer base includes a wide range of industrial and commercial companies, construction contractors, manufacturers, public utilities, municipalities, maintenance contractors and numerous and diverse other large industrial accounts. Our branches enable us to closely service local and regional customers, while our well-developed full-service infrastructure enables us to effectively service multi-regional and national accounts. We believe that our expansive presence and commitment to superior service at all levels of the organization is a key differentiator to many of our competitors. As a result, we spend a significant amount of time and resources to train all key personnel to be responsive and deliver high quality customer service and well-maintained equipment so that we can maintain and grow our customer relationships.
 Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team is led by Bradley M. Barber, our Chief Executive Officer, who has over 23 years of industry experience. Our senior and regional managers have approximately 24 years on average of industry experience. Our branch managers have extensive knowledge and industry experience as well.
Our Business Strategy
 Our business strategy includes, among other things, leveraging our integrated business model, managing the life cycle of our rental equipment, further developing our parts and services operations and selectively entering new markets and pursuing acquisitions. However, the timing and extent to which we implement these various aspects of our strategy depend on a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control, such as general economic conditions and construction activity in the U.S.
 Leverage Our Integrated Business Model. We intend to continue to actively leverage our integrated business model to offer a one-stop solution to our customers’ varied needs with respect to the four categories of heavy construction and industrial equipment on which we focus. We will continue to cross-sell our services to expand and deepen our customer relationships. We believe that our integrated equipment services model provides us with a strong platform for growth and enables us to effectively operate through economic cycles.
 Managing the Life Cycle of Our Rental Equipment. We actively manage the size, quality, age and composition of our rental fleet, employing a “cradle through grave” approach. During the life of our rental equipment, we (1) aggressively negotiate on purchase price; (2) use our customized information technology systems to closely monitor and analyze, among other things, time utilization (equipment usage based on customer demand), rental rate trends and pricing optimization and equipment demand; (3) continuously adjust our fleet mix and pricing; (4) maintain fleet quality through regional quality control managers and our on-site parts and services support; and (5) dispose of rental equipment through our retail sales force. This allows us to purchase our rental equipment at competitive prices, optimally utilize our fleet, cost-effectively maintain our equipment quality and maximize the value of our equipment at the end of its useful life.
 Make Selective Acquisitions. We intend to continue to evaluate and pursue, on an opportunistic basis, acquisitions which meet our selection criteria, including favorable financing terms, with the objective of increasing our revenues, improving our profitability, entering additional attractive markets and strengthening our competitive position. We are focused on identifying and acquiring rental companies to complement our existing business, broaden our geographic footprint, and increase our density in existing markets. Effective January 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Contractors Equipment Center (“CEC”), an equipment rental company serving the greater Denver, Colorado area with three branch locations, for approximately $132.4 million in cash. Effective April 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Rental, Inc., an equipment rental company with five branch locations in Alabama and Florida, for approximately $68.6 million in cash. Effective February 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of We-Rent-Inc., a central Texas based non-residential construction-focused equipment rental company with six branch locations for approximately $100.0 million in cash. 
 Grow Our Parts and Services Operations. Our strong parts and services operations are keystones of our integrated equipment services platform and together provide us with a relatively stable high-margin revenue source. Our parts and services operations help us develop strong, ongoing customer relationships, attract new customers and maintain a high quality rental fleet. We intend to further grow this product support side of our business and further penetrate our customer base.

Enter Carefully Selected New Markets. We intend to continue our strategy of selectively expanding our network to solidify our presence in attractive and contiguous regions where we operate. We look to add new locations in those markets that offer attractive growth opportunities, high or increasing levels of demand for construction and heavy equipment, and contiguity to our existing markets.  
 History
 Through our predecessor companies, we have been in the equipment services business for approximately 58 years. H&E Equipment Services L.L.C. was formed in June 2002 through the combination of Head & Engquist Equipment, LLC (“Head & Engquist”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gulf Wide Industries, L.L.C. (“Gulf Wide”), and ICM Equipment Company L.L.C. (“ICM”). Head & Engquist, founded in 1961, and ICM, founded in 1971, were two leading regional, integrated equipment service companies operating in contiguous geographic markets. In the June 2002 transaction, Head & Engquist and ICM were merged with and into Gulf Wide, which was renamed H&E Equipment Services L.L.C. (“H&E LLC”). Prior to the combination, Head & Engquist operated 25 facilities in the Gulf Coast region, and ICM operated 16 facilities in the Intermountain region of the United States.
 Prior to our initial public offering in February 2006, our business was conducted through H&E LLC. In connection with our initial public offering, we converted H&E LLC into H&E Equipment Services, Inc. In order to have an operating Delaware corporation as the issuer for our initial public offering, H&E Equipment Services, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of H&E Holdings, and immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering, on February 3, 2006, H&E LLC and H&E Holdings merged with and into us (H&E Equipment Services, Inc.), with us surviving the reincorporation merger as the operating company. Effective February 3, 2006, H&E LLC and H&E Holdings no longer existed under operation of law pursuant to the reincorporation merger.
 We completed, effective as of February 28, 2006, the acquisition of all the outstanding capital stock of Eagle High Reach Equipment, Inc. (now known as H&E California Holding, Inc.) and all of the outstanding equity interests of its subsidiary, Eagle High Reach Equipment, LLC (now known as H&E Equipment Services (California), LLC) (collectively, “Eagle” or the “Eagle Acquisition”). Prior to the acquisition, Eagle was a privately-held construction and industrial equipment rental company serving the southern California construction and industrial markets out of four branch locations.
 We completed, effective as of September 1, 2007, the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of J.W. Burress, Incorporated (now known as H&E Equipment Services (Mid-Atlantic), Inc.) (“Burress” or the “Burress Acquisition”). Prior to the acquisition, Burress was a privately-held company operating primarily as a distributor in the construction and industrial equipment markets out of 12 locations in four states in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.
 We completed, effective January 1, 2018, the acquisition of Contractors Equipment Center (“CEC”). Prior to the acquisition, CEC was a privately-held company focused on non-residential construction equipment rentals serving the greater Denver, Colorado area out of three branch locations.
 We completed, effective April 1, 2018, the acquisition of Rental, Inc., an equipment rental company with five branch locations in Alabama and Florida.
 We completed, effective February 1, 2019, the acquisition of We-Rent-Inc., a central Texas based non-residential construction-focused equipment rental company with six branch locations.  
 Customers
 We serve approximately 41,600 customers in the United States, primarily in the West Coast, Intermountain, Southwest, Gulf Coast, Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Our customers include a wide range of industrial and commercial companies, construction contractors, manufacturers, public utilities, municipalities, maintenance contractors and numerous and diverse other large industrial accounts. They vary from small, single machine owners to large contractors and industrial and commercial companies who typically operate under equipment and maintenance budgets. Our branches enable us to closely service local and regional customers, while our well-developed full-service infrastructure enables us to effectively service multi-regional and national accounts. Our integrated strategy enables us to satisfy customer requirements and increase revenues from customers through cross-selling opportunities presented by the various products and services that we offer. As a result, our five reporting segments generally derive their revenue from the same customer base. In 2018, no single customer accounted for more than 1.2% of our total revenues, and no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue on a segmented basis. Our top ten customers combined accounted for approximately 6.5% of our total revenues in 2018.

Sales and Marketing
 We have two distinct, focused sales forces; one specializing in equipment rentals and one focused specifically on new and used equipment sales. We believe maintaining separate sales forces for equipment rental and equipment sales is important to our customer service, allowing us to effectively meet the demands of different types of customers.
 Both our rental sales force and equipment sales force are divided into smaller, product focused teams which enhances the development of in-depth product application and technical expertise. To further develop knowledge and experience, we provide our sales forces with extensive training, including frequent factory and in-house training by manufacturer representatives regarding the operational features, operator safety training and maintenance of new equipment. This training is essential, as our sales personnel regularly call on customers’ job sites, often assisting customers in assessing their immediate and ongoing equipment needs. In addition, we have a commission-based compensation program for our sales forces.
 We maintain a company-wide customer relationship management system. We believe that this comprehensive customer and sales management tool enhances our territory management program by increasing the productivity and efficiency of our sales representatives and branch managers as they are provided real-time access to sales and customer information.
 We have developed strategies to identify target customers for our equipment services in all markets. These strategies allow our sales force to identify frequent rental users, function as advisors and problem solvers for our customers and accelerate the sales process in new operations.
 While our specialized, well-trained sales force strengthens our customer relationships and fosters customer loyalty, we also promote our business through marketing and advertising, including industry publications, direct mail campaigns, television, the Yellow Pages and our Company website at www.he-equipment.com.
 Suppliers
 We purchase a significant amount of equipment from the same manufacturers with whom we have distribution agreements. We purchased approximately 54% of our new equipment and rental fleet from five manufacturers (Grove/Manitowoc, Genie Industries (Terex), JCB, Komatsu, and Skyjack) during the year ended December 31, 2018. These relationships improve our ability to negotiate equipment acquisition pricing. We are also a leading U.S. distributor for nationally-recognized equipment suppliers including JLG Industries, Gehl, Genie Industries (Terex), Komatsu, Doosan/Bobcat and Grove/Manitowoc. As an authorized distributor for a wide range of suppliers, we are also able to provide our customers parts and services that in many cases are covered under the manufacturer’s warranty. While we believe that we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment we purchase in each of our principal product categories, termination of one or more of our relationships with any of our major suppliers of equipment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations if we were unable to obtain adequate or timely rental and sales equipment.
Information Technology Systems
 We have specialized information systems that track (1) rental inventory utilization statistics; (2) maintenance and repair costs; (3) returns on investment for specific equipment types; and (4) detailed operational and financial information for each piece of equipment. These systems enable us to closely monitor our performance and actively manage our business, and include features that were custom designed to support our integrated services platform. The point-of-sale aspect of our systems enables us to link all of our facilities, permitting universal access to real-time data concerning equipment located at the individual facility locations and the rental status and maintenance history for each piece of equipment. In addition, our systems include, among other features, on-line contract generation, automated billing, applicable sales tax computation and automated rental purchase option calculation. We customized our customer relationship management system to enable us to more effectively manage our sales territories and sales representatives’ activity. This customer relationship management system provides sales and customer information, available rental fleet and inventory information, a quote system and other organizational tools to assist our sales forces. We maintain an extensive customer database which allows us to monitor the status and maintenance history of our customers’ owned-equipment and enables us to more effectively provide parts and services to meet their needs. All of our critical systems run on servers and other equipment that is current technology and available from major suppliers and serviceable through existing maintenance agreements.

Seasonality
 Although our business is not significantly impacted by seasonality, the demand for our rental equipment tends to be lower in the winter months. The level of equipment rental activities is directly related to commercial and industrial construction and maintenance activities. Therefore, equipment rental performance will be correlated to the levels of current construction activities. The severity of weather conditions can have a temporary impact on the level of construction activities.
 Equipment sales cycles are also subject to some seasonality with the peak selling period occurring during the spring season and extending through the summer. Parts and services activities are less affected by changes in demand caused by seasonality.
 Competition
 The equipment industry is generally comprised of either pure rental equipment companies or manufacturer dealer/distributorship companies. We are an integrated equipment services company and rent, sell and provide parts and services support. Although there has been some consolidation within the equipment industry in recent years, including the recent acquisitions of Rental Services Corporation, NES Rentals and Neff Corporation by United Rentals, Inc., the equipment industry remains highly fragmented and consists mainly of a small number of multi-location regional or national operators and a large number of relatively small, independent businesses serving discrete local markets. Many of the markets in which we operate are served by numerous competitors, ranging from national and multi-regional equipment rental companies (for example, United Rentals, Sunbelt Rentals and Hertz Equipment Rental) or equipment dealers (for example, Finning and Toromont) to small, independent businesses with a limited number of locations.
 We believe that participants in the equipment rental industry generally compete on the basis of availability, quality, reliability, delivery and price. In general, large operators enjoy substantial competitive advantages over small, independent rental businesses due to a distinct price advantage. Many rental equipment companies’ parts and services offerings are limited and may prove difficult to expand due to the training, infrastructure and management resources necessary to develop the breadth of service offerings and depth of knowledge our service technicians are able to provide. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do.
 Traditionally, equipment manufacturers distributed their equipment and parts through a network of independent dealers with distribution agreements. As a result of consolidation and competition, both manufacturers and distributors sought to streamline their operations, improve their costs and gain market share. Our established, integrated infrastructure enables us to compete directly with our competitors on either a local, regional or national basis. We believe customers place greater emphasis on value-added services, teaming with equipment rental and sales companies who can meet all of their equipment, parts and services needs.
 Environmental and Safety Regulations
 Our facilities and operations are subject to comprehensive and frequently changing federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws. These laws regulate (1) the handling, storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and, if any, the associated cleanup of properties affected by pollutants; (2) air quality (emissions); and (3) wastewater. We do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or competitive position as a result of our efforts to comply with such requirements. Although we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental requirements, we do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls or compliance.
 In the future, federal, state or local governments could enact new or more stringent laws or issue new or more stringent regulations concerning environmental and worker health and safety matters, or effect a change in their enforcement of existing laws or regulations, that could affect our operations. Also, in the future, contamination may be found to exist at our facilities or off-site locations where we have sent wastes. There can be no assurance that we, or various environmental regulatory agencies, will not discover previously unknown environmental non-compliance or contamination. We could be held liable for such newly-discovered non-compliance or contamination. It is possible that changes in environmental and worker health and safety laws or liabilities from newly-discovered non-compliance or contamination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,369 employees. Of these employees, 936 are salaried personnel and 1,433 are hourly personnel. Our employees perform the following functions: sales operations, parts operations, rental operations, technical services and office and administrative support. A collective bargaining agreement relating to two branch locations covers approximately 69 of our employees. We believe our relations with our employees are good, and we have never experienced a work stoppage.

Generally, the total number of employees does not significantly fluctuate throughout the year. However, acquisition activity or the opening of new branches may increase the number of our employees or fluctuations in the level of our business activity could require some staffing level adjustments in response to actual or anticipated customer demand.
