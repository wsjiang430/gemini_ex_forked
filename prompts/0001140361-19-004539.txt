Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies to improve patient outcomes in cancers that are difficult to treat.  Our mission is to improve the lives of cancer patients by developing next-generation cancer therapies that are designed to maximize efficacy while minimizing the toxicity and side effects traditionally associated with cancer treatment.  Our pipeline features two oncology product candidates in Phase 2 clinical development and additional compounds in preclinical development. Our strategy is to advance our existing product candidates and to continue building a pipeline of innovative oncology product candidates.  Our clinical-stage product candidates in development are RX-3117 and RX-5902.

· | RX-3117 is a novel, investigational oral small molecule nucleoside compound. Once intracellularly activated (phosphorylated) by the enzyme UCK2, it is incorporated into the DNA or RNA of cells and inhibits both DNA and RNA synthesis, which induces apoptotic cell death of tumor cells. Because UCK2 is overexpressed in multiple human tumors, but has a very limited presence in normal tissues, RX-3117 offers the potential for a targeted anti-cancer therapy with an improved efficacy and safety profile, and we believe it has therapeutic potential in a broad range of cancers, including pancreatic, bladder, colon, lung and cervical cancer. In January 2018, we reported final data from a Phase 2a clinical trial of RX-3117 in patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer. In this trial evidence of tumor shrinkage was observed in some patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer that was resistant to gemcitabine and who had failed on multiple prior treatments. In this study, 31% of patients experienced progression free survival for two months or more and five patients, or 12%, had disease stabilization for greater than four months. RX-3117 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2a clinical trial in combination with Celgene’s ABRAXANE® (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) as a first-line treatment in patients newly diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Preliminary safety and efficacy data from this trial reported in January 2019 showed a 38% overall response rate in the 24 patients who had at least one scan on treatment and were included in the preliminary evaluation of overall response. The trial began dosing patients in this study in November 2017 and reached the target enrollment of 40 patients in February 2019. RX-3117 has received “orphan drug designation” from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and from the European Commission (“EC”) for pancreatic cancer. RX-3117 is also being evaluated in a Phase 2a clinical trial in advanced bladder cancer. We presented updated preliminary safety and efficacy data from this trial in February 2019.

· | RX-5902 is a potential first-in-class small molecule modulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway which plays a key role in cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. RX-5902 modulates the pathway through inhibition of phosphorylated p68, a protein that helps to transport beta-catenin from the cytoplasm into the cell nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, beta-catenin turns on various oncogenes, thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. We believe that by inhibiting phosphorylated p68, RX-5902 hinders the transport of beta-catenin into the nucleus and reduces the activation of cancer genes. In addition, multiple preclinical models have shown that RX-5902 activates the immune system against cancer and enhances the ability of immune cells to infiltrate the tumor and kill tumor cells. In preclinical models of colorectal and triple negative breast cancer (“TNBC”), the effects of RX-5902 were observed to be synergistic with other immunotherapy agents such as checkpoint inhibitors. We have evaluated RX-5902 in a Phase 1 dose escalation study in patients with a diverse range of metastatic, treatment-refractory tumors, including breast, ovarian, colorectal, and neuro-endocrine tumors. In February 2017, we initiated a Phase 2a clinical trial of RX-5902 in patients with metastatic TNBC. In August 2018, we entered into a collaboration with Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V. (“Merck”) to evaluate the combination of RX-5902 and Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in a Phase 2 trial in patients with metastatic TNBC. In December 2018, we ceased enrollment in the ongoing Phase 2a monotherapy trial of RX-5902 in TNBC to focus RX-5902 development activities on planning the proposed combination trial with KEYTRUDA. We are currently evaluating the development strategy for RX-5902 and may or may not proceed with this trial.

· | RX-0301 is a potential best-in-class, potent inhibitor of the protein kinase Akt-1, which we believe plays a critical role in cancer cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, metastasis and drug resistance. RX-0301 is the subject of a research and development collaboration with Zhejiang Haichang Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (“Haichang”) for the development of RX-0301 to conduct certain preclinical and clinical activities through completion of a Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial in hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”). RX-0301 is being developed as a nano-liposomal formulation of RX-0201 (Archexin®) using Haichang’s proprietary QTsome™ technology. Rexahn was previously developing RX-0201 for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). In February 2018, in response to the changing treatment landscape for metastatic RCC over the prior two years with the approval of new therapies by the FDA, we announced plans to discontinue the internally funded programs of RX-0201 and ceased enrolling patients in a Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial of RX-0201 in patients with metastatic RCC. RX-0301 is currently in preclinical development.

Industry and Disease Markets
 
Market Overview
 
Our primary research and development focus is oncology therapeutics.  A key component of our strategy is to develop innovative drugs that are potential first-in-class or market-leading compounds for the treatment of cancer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cancer claimed the lives of 600,000 Americans in 2015, the latest year for which incidence data is available, and is the second leading cause of death among Americans.  The World Health Organization estimated that there were 18 million new cases of cancer diagnosed worldwide in 2018 and that cancer was responsible for 9.6 million deaths worldwide in 2018.  A 2018 American Cancer Society report projected that an estimated 1.7 million new cancer cases would be diagnosed in the United States in 2018.  The IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science reported in 2018 that total global spending on oncology medicines, including therapeutic treatments and supportive care, reached $133 billion in 2017.

Current Cancer Treatments
 
Traditional cancer treatments involve surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, either alone or in a combined approach.  Surgery is widely used to treat cancer and may be curative for early disease but not if metastasis has occurred.  Radiation therapy, or radiotherapy, can be highly effective in treating certain types of cancer.  In radiation therapy, ionizing radiation deposits energy that injures or destroys cells in the area being treated by damaging their genetic material, making it impossible for these cells to continue to grow.  Although radiation damages both cancer cells and normal cells, the normal cells are generally able to repair themselves and function properly.  Chemotherapy involves the use of cytotoxic cancer drugs to destroy cancer cells by interfering with various stages of the cell division process.  While for certain cancers and in certain patients, these drugs have limited efficacy, they also have debilitating and sometimes life-threatening side effects.  Administration of cytotoxic cancer drugs may also result in the development of multi-drug resistance, a condition that results when certain tumor cells that have survived treatment with cytotoxic drugs are no longer susceptible to treatment by those and other drugs.  Recent advances in cancer treatment include the use of targeted therapies and immunotherapies to stimulate the body’s own immune system to kill cancer cells.  Targeted therapies are directed against specific proteins (targets) that promote the growth of tumor cells and are overexpressed in cancer cells relative to normal tissue.  Targeted therapies may be effective in killing tumors that overexpress the target protein, which are usually found in a subset of patients with any particular tumor type.  Immunotherapy can significantly improve survival in certain cancers.  However, for many common cancers, including pancreatic, breast cancer and colorectal cancer, immunotherapy has shown limited efficacy and there is a risk of over-stimulation of the immune system that can lead to life-threatening autoimmune side-effects, such as colitis, pneumonia, and hepatitis.
Unmet Needs in Cancer
 
Despite significant advances in cancer research and treatments, many unmet needs still remain including:
 
  
· | Effective treatments for metastatic cancer: There is a need for better treatments to prolong life and improve survival in patients diagnosed with late-stage cancers. In many cases, early stage cancer can be effectively treated with surgery and/or radiation and adjuvant drug treatment. However, once the tumor has metastasized, current treatments are usually not curative. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Long-term management of cancers: Surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy may not result in long-term remission, although surgery and radiation therapies are considered effective methods for some cancers. There is a need for more effective drugs and adjuvant therapies to treat relapsed and refractory cancers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Multi-drug resistance: Multi-drug resistance is a major obstacle to effectively treating various cancers with chemotherapy. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Debilitating toxicity by chemotherapy: Chemotherapy as a mainstay of cancer treatment can induce severe adverse reactions and toxicities, adversely affecting quality of life or life itself. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Opportunity
 
There are several factors that we believe are favorable for commercializing new cancer drugs that may have the potential to be first-in-class or market leaders, including:

· | Expedited Regulatory or Commercialization Pathways. Drugs for life-threatening diseases such as cancer are often candidates for fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval, each of which may lead to approval sooner than would otherwise be the case. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Favorable Environment for Formulary Access and Reimbursement. We believe cancer drugs with proven efficacy would gain rapid market uptake, formulary listing and third-party payor reimbursement. Drugs with orphan designations are generally reimbursed by third-party payors because there are few, if any, alternatives. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 3
 
  
· | Low Marketing Costs. We believe the marketing of new drugs to oncologists can be accomplished with a smaller sales force and lower related costs than a sales force that markets widely to primary care physicians and general practitioners. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
 
Our mission is to identify, develop and, directly or through collaborations, bring to market novel products to improve patient outcomes in cancers that are difficult to treat.  We currently have a portfolio of product candidates with the potential to address diseases for which the unmet medical need is high.  Our goal is to be a leader in the development of novel therapeutics for cancer.  Our strategy to achieve this goal is to utilize our experience and capabilities to:

· | Advance our existing product candidates through late-stage clinical trials, generating meaningful clinical results;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Work with U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities for expeditious, efficient development pathways toward registration;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Use our industry relationships and experience to source, evaluate and in-license well-characterized product candidates to continue pipeline development; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Identify potential commercial or distribution partners for our products in relevant territories.

Our Pipeline Product Candidates
 
RX-3117: Oral Small Molecule Nucleoside Analogue
 
RX-3117 is a novel, investigational, oral small molecule nucleoside analogue.  In preclinical models when activated (phosphorylated) by uridine-cytidine kinase 2, a protein that is overexpressed in various human cancer cells, RX-3117 was incorporated into DNA or RNA of cells and inhibited both DNA and RNA synthesis, which induced apoptotic cell death of tumor cells.  We believe RX-3117 has therapeutic potential in a broad range of cancers including pancreatic, bladder, colon, lung and cervical cancer.  RX-3117 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the EC for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.
 
RX-3117 has shown broad spectrum anti-tumor activity against over 100 different human cancer cell lines and efficacy in 17 different mouse xenograft models.  Notably, the efficacy of RX-3117 in the mouse xenograft models was usually superior to that of gemcitabine.  Further, in preclinical trials, RX-3117 retained its anti-tumor activity in human cancer cell lines made resistant to the anti-tumor effects of gemcitabine.  In August 2012, we reported the completion of an exploratory Phase 1 clinical trial of RX-3117 in cancer patients to investigate the oral bioavailability, safety and tolerability of the compound.  In this study, oral administration of a 50 mg dose of RX-3117 indicated an oral bioavailability of 56% and a plasma half-life (T1/2) of 14 hours.  In addition, RX-3117 appeared to be safe and well-tolerated in all subjects throughout the dose range tested.
 
Final results from the Phase 1b clinical trial of RX-3117 presented in June 2016 showed evidence of single agent activity.  Patients in the study had generally received four or more cancer therapies prior to enrollment.  In this study, 12 patients experienced stable disease persisting for up to 276 days and three patients showed evidence of tumor burden reduction.  A maximum tolerated dose of 700 mg was identified in the study.  At the doses tested, RX-3117, administered orally, appeared to be safe and well-tolerated with a predictable pharmacokinetic profile following oral administration.

In March 2016, we initiated a multi-center Phase 2a clinical trial of RX-3117 in patients with relapsed or refractory pancreatic cancer to further evaluate safety and efficacy. Patients in the trial received a 700 mg daily oral dose of RX-3117, for five consecutive days, followed by two days off, for three weeks, followed by a week of rest, in a 28-day cycle for up to eight treatment cycles, or until their disease progressed.  The study was designed as a two-stage study with 10 patients in stage 1 and an additional 40 patients in stage 2.  According to pre-set criteria, if greater than 20% of the patients had an increase in progression free survival of more than four months, or an objective clinical response rate and reduction in tumor size, additional pancreatic cancer patients would be enrolled into stage 2. Secondary endpoints included time to disease progression, overall response rate and duration of response, as well as pharmacokinetic assessments and safety parameters.
 
In September 2016, we initiated stage 2 of this Phase 2a clinical trial based on the satisfaction of the predefined criteria for preliminary signs of efficacy for stage 1 of the trial that showed RX-3117 appeared to be safe and well-tolerated with preliminary signs of efficacy in pancreatic cancer patients for whom three or more prior therapies had been ineffective.  In January 2018, we presented the final data from this trial at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers (“ASCO GI”) Symposium.  In this trial, evidence of tumor shrinkage was observed in some patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer that was resistant to gemcitabine and who had failed on multiple prior treatments.  In this study, 31% of patients experienced progression free survival for two months or more and five patients, or 12%, had disease stabilization for greater than four months.
 
In November 2017, we initiated a Phase 2a trial of RX-3117 in combination with ABRAXANE in patients newly diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic cancer.  The multicenter, single-arm, open-label study is designed to evaluate RX-3117 in combination with ABRAXANE in first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.  In February 2019, we reached the target enrollment of 40 evaluable patients in this trial.   In January 2019, we presented preliminary safety and efficacy data at the 2019 ASCO GI Symposium.  As of January 9, 2019, 36 patients were enrolled into the study, and 24 patients had at least one scan on treatment and were included in the evaluation of overall response.  One patient (1/24, 4.2%) had a complete response after six cycles of treatment and eight patients (8/24, 33.3%) had a partial response.  A further 13 patients had stable disease (13/24, 54.2%).  The overall response rate was 38%, and the disease stabilization rate at eight weeks was 92%.  The combination of RX-3117 and ABRAXANE appears to be safe and well-tolerated.  The most commonly reported related adverse events were nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, alopecia, decreased appetite, rash, vomiting and anemia.
 
In September 2016, we commenced enrollment in a Phase 2a trial of RX-3117 in patients with advanced bladder cancer who had progressed on multiple prior treatments.  This Phase 2a clinical trial is a multicenter, open-label, single-agent study of RX-3117 being conducted at 10 clinical centers in the United States.  RX-3117 is being administered orally five times weekly on a three weeks on, one week off dosing schedule for up to eight weeks, or until patients’ disease progresses.  The primary endpoint for the trial is an assessment of the progression free survival rate or an objective clinical response rate and reduction in tumor size.  Secondary endpoints include time to disease progression, overall response rate and duration of response, as well as pharmacokinetic assessments and safety.  In February 2019, we presented data from this trial at the ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium.  Preliminary signs of efficacy, including a complete response, were observed.  Of the 31 patients who had at least one scan on treatment and were therefore included in the preliminary efficacy analysis, five patients had stable disease for at least four months, two of whom stayed in the trial for six months or longer.  Mild to moderate fatigue, nausea and diarrhea are the most common side effects observed in the trial to date.  We are evaluating potential development paths for RX-3117 in advanced bladder cancer, however, no additional trials are currently planned for this indication.

RX-5902: Potential First-in-Class Inhibitor of Phosphorylated p68
 
RX-5902 is a potential first-in-class small molecule modulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.  Activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is recognized to a key driver of cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth.  Activation of the pathway leads to accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus of cancer cells that turns on cancer-related genes.  RX-5902 inhibits a protein, phosphorylated p68, that helps to transport beta-catenin from the cytoplasm into the cell nucleus.  Once inside the nucleus, beta-catenin turns on various oncogenes, thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth.  By inhibiting phosphorylated p68, RX-5902 hinders the transport of beta-catenin into the nucleus, which results in decreased levels of beta catenin in the nucleus and in turn decreases the expression of cancer-related genes.  In preclinical tissue culture models and in-vivo xenograft models, RX-5902 has exhibited single-agent tumor growth inhibition, potential synergy with cytotoxic agents and activity against drug resistant cancer cells.  In particular, in in-vivo xenograft mouse models of human TNBC and pancreatic cancer, treatment with RX-5902 produced a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth and a survival benefit.  In addition, multiple preclinical models have shown that RX-5902 activates the immune system against cancer and enhances the ability of immune cells to infiltrate the tumor and kill tumor cells In preclinical models of colorectal and TNBC, the effects of RX-5902 were observed to be synergistic with other immunotherapy agents such as checkpoint inhibitors.
  
 RX-5902 was evaluated in a Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial in cancer patients with solid tumors designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities and the recommended Phase 2 dose.  Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetic analyses and an evaluation of the preliminary anti-tumor effects of RX-5902.  We completed enrollment in this study in 2016.  Final results from the Phase 1 clinical trial of RX-5902 presented in September 2017 showed evidence of single-agent, clinical activity of RX-5902.  In this study, RX-5902 preliminarily appeared to be safe and well-tolerated at the doses and dosing schedules tested with no dose limiting toxicities or treatment-related serious adverse events.  The most frequently reported drug related adverse events were mild to moderate fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.  Thirty-nine subjects were enrolled (24 female, 15 male), of which 26 were evaluable.  Fourteen subjects experienced stable disease in breast, neuroendocrine, paraganglioma, head/neck, ovarian or colorectal cancer.  Three subjects received treatment for more than one year.  Approximately 64% of the subjects, or 25 of 39, had received four or more therapies prior to their enrollment in the Phase 1 clinical trial.


We initiated a Phase 2a clinical trial of RX-5902 in patients with metastatic TNBC in February 2017.  This trial was intended to evaluate preliminary signs of safety and efficacy of RX-5902 in patients who have failed prior treatments.  As of October 12, 2018, 17 patients had been enrolled in the trial, with 13 of these patients evaluable and six showing a clinical response.  In August 2018, we entered into a collaboration with Merck to evaluate the combination of RX-5902 and Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA, in a Phase 2 trial in patients with metastatic TNBC.  Data generated to date do not support further development of RX-5902 as a monotherapy for TNBC and in December 2018, we ceased enrollment in the ongoing Phase 2a trial to focus RX-5902 development activities on planning the proposed combination trial with KEYTRUDA. We are currently evaluating the development strategy for RX-5902 and may or may not proceed with this trial.
 
RX-0301:  Potential Best-in-Class Anti-Cancer Akt-1 Inhibitor
 
RX-0301 is a potential best-in-class, potent anti-sense inhibitor of protein kinase Akt-1 synthesis and activity, which we believe plays a critical role in cancer cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, metastasis and drug resistance.
 
 6
 
RX-0301 is being developed as a nano-liposomal formulation of RX-0201, an antisense oligonucleotide compound that is complementary to mRNA coding for Akt-1.  RX-0201 binds to the mRNA, inhibiting transcription and production of the Akt-1 protein.  RX-0201 preliminarily appeared to be safe and well-tolerated with minimal side effects in a Phase 1 trial in patients with advanced cancers, where Grade 3 fatigue was the only dose-limiting toxicity and no significant hematological abnormalities were observed. RX-0301 is being developed under a collaboration with Haichang using Haichang’s proprietary QTsome™ technology.  Under the agreement, Haichang intends to conduct a Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial in HCC in China.
 
We completed a Phase 2a clinical trial for RX-0201 that was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of RX-0201 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.  RX-0201 appeared to be safe and well-tolerated with a preliminary indication of activity.
 
In January 2014, we initiated a Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial of RX-0201 to study its safety and efficacy in combination with Novartis’ Afinitor® (everolimus) in patients with RCC.  In February 2018, following a portfolio review of assets and in response to the changing treatment landscape for RCC patients over the prior two years with the approval of new therapies by the FDA, we announced plans to discontinue the internally funded programs of RX-0201 and ceased enrolling patients in this trial.
 
Research and Development Process
 
We have engaged third-party contract research organizations and other investigators and collaborators, such as universities and medical institutions, to conduct our preclinical studies, toxicology studies and clinical trials. Engaging third-party contract research organizations is typical practice in our industry. However, relying on such organizations means that the clinical trials and other studies described above are being conducted at external locations and that the completion of these trials and studies is not within our direct control. Trials and studies may be delayed due to circumstances outside our control, and such delays may result in additional expenses for us.
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.  We compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies, including smaller companies that are or may be collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations.  Many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as more experience in:

· | developing drugs;
--+------------------


· | undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | formulating and manufacturing drugs; and
--+-----------------------------------------


· | launching, marketing and selling drugs.
--+----------------------------------------



 7
 
Large pharmaceutical companies currently sell both generic and proprietary compounds for the treatment of cancer.  In addition, companies developing oncology therapies represent substantial competition.  Many of these organizations have substantially greater capital resources, larger research and development staff and facilities, history in obtaining regulatory approvals and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do.  These organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel, parties for acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations.
 
There are currently marketed products and product candidates under development by our competitors that have similar mechanisms or action or target some of the same indications as our clinical stage product candidates.  If approved, RX-3117 could compete with other compounds with an anti-metabolite mechanism of action in cancers, such as NUC-1031 (Acelarin®), which is under development by NuCana, and other approved nucleoside analogues such as capecitabine and gemcitabine.  We are not currently aware of known inhibitors of phosphorylated p68 that would compete with RX-5902 if RX-5902 were approved, but other drugs with a different mechanism of action are approved or in development for the same indications, including AstraZeneca’s LYNPARZA® (olaparib), Immunomedics’ sacituzumab govitecan and various PD-1 inhibitors, including Genentech’s TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab), that are in development for TNBC.  If approved, RX-0301 could compete with other Akt-1 inhibitors under development by other companies including Merck & Company, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Gilead Sciences, MEI Pharma, PIQUR Therapeutics and others.
 
Government Regulation
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and in other countries is a significant consideration in our product development, manufacturing and, upon approval of our product candidates, marketing strategies.  We expect that all our product candidates will require regulatory approval by the FDA and by similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to commercialization and will be subjected to rigorous preclinical, clinical, and post-approval testing to demonstrate safety and effectiveness, as well as other significant regulatory requirements and restrictions in each jurisdiction in which we would seek to market our products.  U.S. federal laws and regulations govern the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, storage, labeling, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export and marketing of all biopharmaceutical products intended for therapeutic purposes.  We believe that we and the third parties that work with us are in compliance in all material respects with currently applicable rules and regulations, however, any failure to comply could have a material negative impact on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our products, and therefore on our financial performance.  In addition, the rules and regulations that apply to our business are subject to change.  For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”) was signed into law.  The Cures Act included numerous provisions that may be relevant to our product candidates, including provisions designed to speed development of innovative therapies and provide funding for certain cancer-related research and technology development.  Further legislative and regulatory changes appear possible in the 116th United States Congress and under the Trump Administration, and it is difficult to foresee whether, how, or when such changes may affect our business.
 
Obtaining governmental approvals and maintaining ongoing compliance with applicable regulations are expected to require the expenditure of significant financial and human resources not currently at our disposal.  We plan to fulfill our short-term needs through consulting agreements and joint ventures with academic or corporate partners while developing our own internal infrastructure for long-term corporate growth.

Development and Approval
 
The process to obtain approval for biopharmaceutical compounds for commercialization in the United States and many other countries is lengthy, complex and expensive, and the outcome is far from certain.  Although foreign requirements for conducting clinical trials and obtaining approval may be different than in the United States, they often are equally rigorous and the outcome cannot be predicted with confidence.  A key component of any submission for approval in any jurisdiction is preclinical and clinical data demonstrating the product’s safety and effectiveness.
 
Preclinical Testing.  Before testing any compound in humans in the United States, a company must develop preclinical data, generally including laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in animal species to assess safety and quality.  Certain types of animal studies must be conducted in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations and the Animal Welfare Act, which is enforced by the Department of Agriculture.
 
IND Application.  A person or entity sponsoring clinical trials in the United States to evaluate a candidate’s safety and effectiveness must submit to the FDA, prior to commencing such studies, an investigational new drug (“IND”) application, which contains preclinical testing results and provides a basis for the FDA to conclude that there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in humans.  If the FDA does not object to the IND application within 30 days of submission, the clinical testing proposed in the IND may begin.  Even after the IND has gone into effect and clinical testing has begun, the FDA may put the clinical trials on “clinical hold,” suspending (or in some cases, ending) them because of safety concerns or for other reasons.
 
Clinical Trials.  Clinical trials involve administering a drug to human volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified clinical investigator.  Clinical trials are subject to extensive regulation.  In the United States, this includes compliance with the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and current good clinical practices (“cGCP”) requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of, clinical trials, with the goal of assuring that the data and results are credible and accurate and that study participants’ rights, safety and well-being are protected.  Each clinical trial must be conducted under a protocol that details the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated.  The protocol is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and reviewed by the agency before the study begins.  Additionally, each clinical trial must be reviewed, approved and conducted under the auspices of an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”).  The sponsor of a clinical trial, the investigators and IRBs each must comply with requirements and restrictions that govern, among other things, obtaining informed consent from each study subject, complying with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting adverse events.  Foreign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements applicable to studies conducted in the United States.  However, if a foreign study is not conducted under an IND, the data may still be submitted to the FDA in support of a product application, if the study was conducted in accordance with cGCP and the FDA is able to validate the data.
 
The sponsors of a clinical trial or the sponsor’s designated responsible party may be required to register certain information about the trial and disclose certain results on government or independent registry websites, such as http://clinicaltrials.gov.
 
Clinical testing is typically performed in three phases, which may overlap or be subdivided in some cases.
 
 9
 
In Phase 1, the drug is administered to a small number of human subjects to assess its safety and to develop detailed profiles of its pharmacological and pharmacokinetic actions (i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion).  Although Phase 1 trials typically are conducted in healthy human subjects, in some instances (including, for example, with some cancer therapies) the study subjects are patients with the targeted disease or condition.
 
In Phase 2, the drug is administered to a relatively small sample of the intended patient population to develop initial data regarding efficacy in the targeted disease, determine the optimal dose range, and generate additional information regarding the drug’s safety.  Additional animal toxicology studies may precede this phase.  In some cases, Phase 2 testing can be split into Phase 2a and 2b studies in order to test smaller subject pools and to evaluate particular aspects of the drug product.
 
In Phase 3, the drug is administered to a larger group of patients, which may include patients with concomitant diseases and medications.  Typically, Phase 3 trials are conducted at multiple study sites and may be conducted concurrently for the sake of time and efficiency.  The purpose of Phase 3 clinical trials is to obtain additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the drug’s overall risk-benefit profile and to provide a basis for product labeling.  Phase 3 data often form the core basis on which the FDA evaluates a product candidate’s safety and effectiveness when considering the product application.
 
The study sponsor, the FDA or an IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  Additionally, success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials, and data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent approval.
 
NDA Submission and Review.  After completing the clinical studies, a sponsor seeking approval to market a drug in the United States submits to the FDA a New Drug Application (“NDA”).  The NDA is a comprehensive, multi-volume application intended to demonstrate the product’s safety and effectiveness and includes, among other things, preclinical and clinical data, information about the drug’s composition, the sponsor’s plans for manufacturing and packaging and proposed labeling.  When an NDA is submitted, the FDA makes an initial determination as to whether the application is sufficiently complete to be accepted for review.  If the application is not, the FDA may refuse to accept the NDA for filing and request additional information.  A refusal to file, which requires resubmission of the NDA with the requested additional information, delays review of the application.
 
FDA performance goals generally provide for action on an NDA within 12 months of its submission.  That deadline can be extended under certain circumstances, including by the FDA’s requests for additional information.  The targeted action date can also be shortened to eight months after submission for products that are granted priority review designation because they are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs.  The FDA has other programs to expedite development and review of product candidates that address serious or life-threatening conditions.  For example, the Fast Track program is intended to facilitate the development and review of new drugs that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs involving serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.  If a drug receives Fast Track designation, the FDA may review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis, rather than requiring the entire application to be submitted to begin the review.  Products with Fast Track designation also may be eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondence with the FDA about the product’s development.  Another FDA program intended to expedite development is Accelerated Approval, which allows approval on the basis of a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Breakthrough Therapy designation, which is available for drugs under development for serious or life-threatening conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence shows that the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy, means that a drug will be eligible for all of the benefits of Fast Track designation, as well as more intensive guidance from the FDA on an efficient drug development program and a commitment from the agency to involve senior FDA managers in such guidance.  Even if a product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation or Breakthrough Therapy designation, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for designation, and/or may determine that the product does not meet the standards for approval.  As applicable, we anticipate seeking to utilize these programs to expedite the development and review of our product candidates, but we cannot ensure, that our product candidates will qualify for such programs.
 
 10
 
If the FDA concludes that an NDA does not meet the regulatory standards for approval, it typically issues a Complete Response letter, which communicates the reasons for the agency’s decision not to approve the application and may request additional information, including additional clinical data.  An NDA may be resubmitted with the deficiencies addressed, but resubmission does not guarantee approval.  Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA’s interpretation of data may differ from the sponsor’s.  Obtaining approval can take years, requires substantial resources and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the targeted disease or condition, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials.  Additionally, as a condition of approval, the FDA may impose restrictions that could affect the commercial prospects of a product and increase our costs, such as a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), and/or post-approval commitments to conduct additional clinical or non-clinical studies or to conduct surveillance programs to monitor the drug’s effects.
 
Moreover, once a product is approved, information about its safety or effectiveness from broader clinical use may limit or prevent successful commercialization because of regulatory action or market forces or for other reasons.  Post-approval modifications to a drug product, such as changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require development and submission of additional information or data in a new or supplemental NDA, which would also require FDA approval.
 
One of our product candidates, RX-0301 is an antisense oligonucleotide (“ASO”) compound.  To date, the FDA has not approved any NDAs for any ASO compounds for cancer treatment; however, the FDA has approved several ASO compounds in other therapeutic areas, such as fomivirsen (marketed as Vitravene®) as a treatment for cytomegalovirus retinitis, and mipomersen sodium (marketed as Kynamro®), as a treatment for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.  In addition, RX-0301 is in a drug class known as Akt-1 inhibitors, and drugs from this class have not been approved by the FDA to date.
 
We have not submitted an NDA for any of our product candidates.
 
Exclusivity and Patent Protection.  In the United States and elsewhere, certain regulatory exclusivities and patent rights can provide an approved drug product with protection from certain competitors’ products for a period of time and within a certain scope.  In the United States, those protections include regulatory exclusivity under the under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”).  The Hatch-Waxman Act provides periods of exclusivity for a branded drug product that would serve as a reference listed drug (“RLD”) for a generic drug applicant filing an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or for an applicant filing a 505(b)(2) NDA application.  If such a product is a “new chemical entity” (“NCE”) generally meaning that the active moiety has never before been approved in any drug—there is a period of five years from the product’s approval during which the FDA may not accept for filing any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a drug with the same active moiety.  An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted after four years, however, if the sponsor of the application makes a Paragraph IV certification (as described below).  Such a product that is not an NCE may qualify for a three-year period of exclusivity if its NDA contains new clinical data, derived from studies conducted by or for the sponsor, that were necessary for approval.  In this instance, the three-year exclusivity period does not preclude filing or review of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application; rather, the FDA is precluded from granting final approval to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until three years after approval of the RLD.  This 3-year exclusivity applies only to the conditions of approval that required submission of the clinical data.
 
 11
 
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for the restoration of a portion of the patent term lost during product development and FDA review of an NDA if approval of the application is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug containing the active ingredient.  The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of the IND or the date of patent grant (whichever is later) and the date of submission of the NDA, plus the time between the date of submission of the NDA and the date of FDA approval of the product.  The maximum period of restoration is five years, and the patent cannot be extended to more than 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product.  Only one patent claiming each approved product is eligible for restoration and the patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval.
 
Another form of regulatory exclusivity in the United States available is the Orphan Drug Act, which is available for drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States.  If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition and meets other qualifying criteria, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to the product for that use.  A product that has received orphan drug designation is eligible for research and development tax credits and is exempt from user fees under certain circumstances.  Additionally, a drug that is the first to be approved for its orphan-designated indication generally receives seven years of orphan drug exclusivity.  During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for a product containing the same active moiety and proposed for the same indication.  There are exceptions, however, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity.  An approved orphan drug also may qualify for an exemption from the branded prescription drug fee.  Products that qualify for orphan designation may also qualify for other FDA programs that are intended to expedite the development and approval process and, as a practical matter, clinical trials for orphan products may be smaller, simply because of the smaller patient population.  Nonetheless, the same approval standards apply to orphan-designated products as for other drugs.
 
RX-3117 received orphan drug designation for pancreatic cancer from the FDA in September 2014.
 
A medicinal product may be granted an orphan designation in the EU if: (i) it would be used to treat or prevent a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition and either affects no more than five in 10,000 people in the EU or for economic reasons would be unlikely to be developed without incentives; and (ii) no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned exists, or, if such a method exists, the medicinal product would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.  The application for orphan designation must be submitted to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and approved prior to market authorization.  Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity.  During this ten-year period, with limited exceptions, neither the competent authorities of the EU Member States, the EMA, nor the EC are permitted to accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products with the same therapeutic indication.  However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during that period with the consent of the holder of the marketing authorization or if the manufacturer of the product is unable to supply sufficient quantities.  Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the latter product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original product.  The period of market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 
RX-3117 received orphan designation from the EC in January 2018.
 
 12
 
Competition.  The Hatch-Waxman Act establishes two abbreviated approval pathways for drug products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved branded NDA products: (i) generic versions of the approved RLD, which may be approved under an ANDA by showing that the generic product is the “same as” the approved product in key respects; and (ii) a product that is similar but not identical to the RLD, which may be approved under a 505(b)(2) NDA, in which the sponsor relies to some degree on the FDA’s finding that the RLD is safe and effective, but submits its own product-specific data to support the differences between the product and the RLD.
 
The sponsor of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking to rely on an approved product as the RLD must make one of several certifications regarding each patent for the RLD that is listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, which is referred to as the Orange Book.  A “Paragraph III” certification is the sponsor’s statement that it will wait for the patent to expire before obtaining approval for its product.  A “Paragraph IV” certification is an assertion that the patent does not block approval of the later product, either because the patent is invalid or unenforceable or because the patent, even if valid, is not infringed by the new product.  Once the FDA accepts for filing an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must within 20 days provide notice to the RLD NDA holder and patent owner that the application has been submitted, and provide the factual and legal basis for the applicant’s assertion that the patent is invalid or not infringed.  If the NDA holder or patent owner files suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a period of 30 months or the resolution of the underlying suit, whichever is earlier.
 
Post-Approval Regulation
 
Once approved, drug products are subject to continuing extensive regulation by the FDA.  If ongoing regulatory requirements are not met, or if safety problems occur after a product reaches market, the FDA may take actions to change the conditions under which the product is marketed, including limiting, suspending or even withdrawing approval.  In addition to FDA regulation, our business is also subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulation.
    Good Manufacturing Practices.  Companies engaged in manufacturing drug products or their components must comply with applicable current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements, which include requirements regarding organization and training of personnel, building and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers, closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls and records and reports.  The FDA inspects equipment, facilities and manufacturing processes before approval and conducts periodic re-inspections after approval.  Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements or the conditions of the product’s approval may lead the FDA to seek sanctions, including fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, imposition of operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution.  Although we periodically monitor FDA compliance of the third parties on which we rely for manufacturing our drug products, we cannot be certain that our present or future third-party manufacturers will consistently comply with cGMP or other applicable FDA regulatory requirements.
 
Sales and Marketing.  Once a product is approved, its advertising, promotion and marketing will be subject to close regulation, including with regard to promotion to healthcare practitioners, direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet.  In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, state and federal fraud and abuse laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry.  Failure to comply with applicable requirements in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity, investigations and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and/or state authorities.  This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug or biological products.
 
 13
 
Other Requirements.  Companies that manufacture or distribute drug products pursuant to approved NDAs must meet numerous other regulatory requirements, including adverse event reporting, submission of periodic reports, and record-keeping obligations.
 
Fraud and Abuse Laws.  At such time as we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval, it is possible that our business activities could be subject to scrutiny and enforcement under one or more federal or state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, which could affect our ability to operate our business.  These restrictions under applicable federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:
 
  
· | The federal Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly or willingly offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any health care items or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Liability may be established under the federal Anti-Kickback Law without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Law protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exemption or safe harbor, or for which no exception or safe harbor is available, may be subject to scrutiny.

· | The federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper marketing activities, including: providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing sham consulting fees, grants, free travel and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe the company’s products; and inflating prices reported to private price publication services, which are used to set drug payment rates under government healthcare programs. In addition, in recent years the government has pursued civil False Claims Act cases against a number of pharmaceutical companies for causing false claims to be submitted as a result of the marketing of their products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claim laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs.

· | Analogous state and local laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; and state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to clinical trials, or information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures;

· | The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held in the company by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997 and other similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Violations of United States or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits and other legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Violations of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations are punishable by significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines and exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid.  Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated.  Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly.
 
Privacy Laws.  We are also subject to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information.  The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues that may affect our business, including recently enacted laws in all jurisdictions where we operate.  Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information.  Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (including the imposition of significant penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our business.  In addition, if we successfully commercialize our product candidates, we may obtain patient health information from healthcare providers who prescribe our products and research institutions we collaborate with, and they are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (collectively, “HIPAA”).  Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.
 
 15
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval.  The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country.  Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals.  Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed.  In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted.  In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted.  As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which could negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that particular country.  Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.
 
Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available in a timely manner from government third-party payors, including government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations.  Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels.  Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which may not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication.  The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved.
 
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment.  Government healthcare programs and other third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications.  Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products.  We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available promptly or at all for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be.  Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases.  Limited coverage may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.  If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.
 
 16
 
Obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process.  There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities.  Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution.  Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary.  Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services.  Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States.  Limited coverage may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.  Third-party payors also may seek additional clinical evidence, including expensive pharmacoeconomic studies, beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, demonstrating clinical benefits and value in specific patient populations, before covering our products for those patients.  If reimbursement is available only for limited indications, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.  Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.
 
United States Healthcare Reform
 
The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.
 
In recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs administered by physicians.  CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs.  Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products, which in turn would affect the price we can receive for those products.  While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates.  Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
 
 17
 
The Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry.  The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms.  Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be fully implemented, and certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges.  In addition, there have been efforts by the Trump Administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act and to alter the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and related laws.  For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly referred to as the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019.  Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes and judicial challenges related to the Affordable Care Act remain possible.  Any such changes could decrease the number of individuals with health coverage.  It is possible that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved.  In December 2018, a United States District Court Judge for the Northern District of Texas ruled that the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional because the tax penalty associated with the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  This ruling is under appeal and stayed pending appeal.  While the court, the Trump Administration and CMS have stated that the ruling will have no effect while this appeal is pending, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals and other efforts to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, regulations promulgated under the Affordable Care Act or portions thereof will impact the Affordable Care Act and its implementation.
 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted.  For example, recent legislative enactments have resulted in Medicare payments being subject to a two percent reduction, referred to as sequestration, until 2027.  Continuation of sequestration or enactment of other reductions in Medicare reimbursement for drugs could affect our ability to achieve a profit on any candidate products that are approved for marketing.
 
We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been adopted and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and new payment methodologies, and in additional downward pressure on coverage and payment and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our future revenues.  Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.  The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a number of significant regulations in other jurisdictions regarding clinical trials, approval, manufacturing, marketing and promotion and safety reporting.  These requirements and restrictions vary from country to country, but in many instances are similar to the United States requirements, and failure to comply with them could have the same negative effects as noncompliance in the United States.
Sales and Marketing
 
We do not currently have the sales and marketing infrastructure in place that would be necessary to sell and market products. As our product candidates progress, while we may build the infrastructure that would be needed to successfully market and sell any successful drug candidate on our own, we currently anticipate seeking strategic alliances and partnerships with third parties.  The establishment of a sales and marketing operation can be expensive, complicated and time consuming and could delay any product candidate launch.

Manufacturing and Distribution
 
We have no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing, and we lack the resources and expertise to formulate or manufacture our own product candidates internally.  Therefore, we rely on third-party expertise to support us in this area.  We have entered into contracts with third-party manufacturers to manufacture, supply, and store and distribute supplies of our product candidates for our clinical trials.  If any of our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to rely on third-party contractors to manufacture our drugs.  We have no current plans to build internal manufacturing capacity for any product, and we have no long-term supply arrangements.
Intellectual Property
 
We generally seek proprietary patent and intellectual property (“IP”) protection for our product candidates, processes, and other know-how.  In addition to patent protection, we rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and safeguard and maintain our IP.
 
We hold U.S. and foreign patents for our product candidates that expire from 2023 to 2036.  We hold U.S., European and Japanese patents for RX-3117, RX-5902 and RX-0301.  In addition to these patents, we have issued or pending patents in other jurisdictions.
 
The patent portfolios for our most advanced programs are summarized below:
 
RX-3117:
 
The RX-3117 patent portfolio consists of three patent families.  The first family consists of patents that have been issued in the United States, Europe, Japan and other jurisdictions. The patents in this family include composition of matter, use and process claims of varying scope, including picture claims to RX-3117 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.  The patents in this first family expire in 2025 but may be extended by patent term extension and orphan and market exclusivity.  The second family consists of patents that have been issued in the United States, Europe and Japan and are pending in other jurisdictions.  The patents in the second family include process claims that cover RX-3117.  The patents in this second family expire in 2034.  The third family consists of a patent that is issued in the United States and pending in other jurisdictions.  This patent includes use claims that cover the administration of RX-3117.  This patent expires in 2036.
 
RX-5902:
 
The RX-5902 patent portfolio consists of three patent families.  The first family consists of patents that have been issued in the United States and Europe and are pending other jurisdictions.  The patents in the first family include composition of matter, use and process claims of varying scope, including picture claims to RX-5902 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.  The patents in this first family expire in 2025 and may be extended up to five years in the United States.  We also expect RX-5902 will be protected with market exclusivity in Europe for a minimum of ten years post-approval and in Japan for eight years.  The second family consists of patents that are issued in the United States and Japan and pending in Europe and other jurisdictions.  The patents in the second family include formulation and process claims that cover RX-5902.  The patents in this second family would expire in 2034.  The third family consists of a patent that is issued in the United States and pending elsewhere.  The patent in the third family includes use claims that cover RX-5902.  This patent will expire in 2036.
 
 19
 
RX-0301:
 
The RX-0301 patent portfolio consists of a patent family that includes patents that have been issued in the United States, Europe, Japan and other jurisdictions.  The patents in this family include composition of matter and use claims of varying scope, including picture claims to RX-0301 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.  The expiration date of these patents ranges from 2023 to 2025 and may be extended by up to five years in certain countries including the United States.  In addition, it is expected that RX-0301 will be protected from generic launches by market and orphan designations for up to seven years in the United States, and ten years in Europe and Japan.
 
Collaboration and License Arrangements
 
We have numerous collaborative research and development relationships with universities, research institutions pharmaceutical companies and other organizations.
 
Zhejiang Haichang Biotechnology Co., Ltd.
 
In February 2018, we entered into a research and development collaboration agreement with Haichang, a privately owned specialized biotechnology company incorporated in Hangzhou, China and focused on the development and manufacture of complex intravenous pharmaceutical products primarily for cancer treatment.  Under the agreement, Haichang will develop RX-0301 using its proprietary QTsome™ technology and will conduct certain preclinical and clinical activities through completion of a Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial in HCC in China.  Haichang will fund all development activities through completion of the Phase 2a clinical trial up to an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 and the parties will share downstream licensing fees and royalties paid by third parties in an agreed ratio in connection with the further development and commercialization of RX-0301 for the treatment of HCC.  If Haichang exercises its right of first negotiation after completion of the Phase 2a clinical trial to obtain an exclusive license to further develop and commercialize RX-0301 in China, Haichang will pay customary license fees, milestone payments and royalties to us.  Any clinical trials conducted by Haichang will be designed to meet both FDA and China Food and Drug Administration requirements.
Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V.
 
In August 2018, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of RX-5902 with Merck’s anti-PD‑1 therapy, KEYTRUDA, in patients with metastatic TNBC.  Under the terms of the agreement, we will sponsor the clinical trial and Merck will supply us with KEYTRUDA for use in the trial.  The agreement provides that the parties will jointly own clinical data generated from this trial.  We are currently evaluating the development strategy for RX-5902 and may or may not proceed with this trial.
Rexgene Biotech Co., Ltd. (“Rexgene”) and NEXT BT Co. Ltd (“Next BT”)
 
In February 2003, we entered into a research collaboration agreement with Rexgene, which agreed to assist us with the research, development and clinical trials necessary for registration of RX-0201 in Asia.  Under the agreement, we granted Rexgene an exclusive license, with right to sublicense, to make, have made, use, sell and import RX-0201 in Asia.  In accordance with the agreement, Rexgene paid us a one-time fee of $1,500,000 in 2003.
 
On February 5, 2018, we entered into a royalty and release agreement with Next-BT, the successor in interest to Rexgene.  In exchange for Next BT terminating its rights to RX-0201 in Asia, we agreed to pay Next BT a royalty in the low single digits of any net sales of RX-0201 we make in Asia and 50% of our licensing revenue related to licensing of RX-0201 in Asia, up to an aggregate of $5,000,000.  The agreement will terminate upon the earlier of Next BT’s receipt of $5,000,000 under the agreement, February 5, 2025 if Next BT has received at least $3,000,000 under the agreement by that date, and the date after February 5, 2025 that Next BT has received cumulative payments of $3,000,000 under the agreement.  On June 18, 2018, we amended the royalty and release agreement with Next BT, to reinstate the exclusive license to RX-0201 in Asia.  We retained the rights to RX-0301 in Asia and elsewhere.

Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (“KRICT”)
 
In June 2009, we entered into a license agreement with KRICT to acquire rights to all of KRICT’s intellectual property related to quinoxaline-piperazine derivatives, which includes RX-5902.  We paid an initial license fee of $100,000 in July 2009, and will pay a one-time milestone payment of $1,000,000 to KRICT upon marketing approval from FDA for the first commercial product stemming from licensed intellectual property (the “Milestone Payment”).  Upon payment of the Milestone Payment all of the rights previously licensed to us will be transferred to us and the agreement will terminate.  The agreement is terminable by either party for the other party’s material breach, subject to a 60-day cure period.  To date, we have paid only the $100,000 initial license fee pursuant to this agreement.
The University of Maryland Baltimore (“UMB”)
 
In July 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with UMB for a novel drug delivery platform, Nano-Polymer-Drug Conjugate Systems.  In December 2018, we terminated this agreement to focus resources on the development of RX-3117 and RX-5902.
The Ohio State University
 
In October 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the Ohio State Innovation Foundation, an affiliate of The Ohio State University, for a novel oligonucleotide drug delivery platform, Lipid-Coated Albumin Nanoparticle.  In December 2018, we terminated this agreement to focus resources on the development of RX-3117 and RX-5902.
