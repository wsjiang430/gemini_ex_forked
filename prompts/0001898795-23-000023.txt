Item 1. Business
General
LiveWire Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to in this Form 10-K as “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company,” or “LiveWire.” LiveWire is an industry-leading all-electric motorcycle brand with a focus on pioneering the rapidly growing two-wheel electric motorcycle space.
LiveWire was a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of AEA-Bridges Impact Corp (“ABIC”), which was originally incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on July 29, 2020, as a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) with the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. 
The Company assessed that it has two reportable segments based upon how management reviews the operations of the business: Electric Motorcycles (“Electric Motorcycles”) and STACYC (“STACYC”). The Company's reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services and are managed separately based on the fundamental differences in their operations. The Electric Motorcycles segment primarily focuses on the designing and selling of electric motorcycles and also sells electric motorcycle parts, accessories, and apparel. Electric motorcycles are sold at wholesale to a network of independent dealers and retailers, at retail through a Company-owned dealer, and through online sales. The STACYC segment primarily focuses on the designing and selling of electric balance bikes for kids. The STACYC segment products are sold at wholesale to independent dealers and independent distributors, as well as direct to consumers online.
Business Combination
On September 26, 2022, the Company consummated a business combination pursuant to a business combination agreement, dated as of December 12, 2021 (the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among ABIC, LiveWire EV Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (now known as “LiveWire Group, Inc.”), LW EV Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”), Harley-Davidson, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (“H-D”), and LiveWire EV, LLC (“Legacy LiveWire”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of H-D.
Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement: (a) on September 23, 2022, ABIC migrated to and domesticated as a Delaware corporation (“Domesticated ABIC”) (the “Domestication”), in connection with which all of ABIC’s (i) outstanding ordinary shares were converted, on a one-for-one basis, into common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Domesticated ABIC, (ii) outstanding warrants were converted, on a one-for-one basis, into warrants to acquire one share each of common stock of Domesticated ABIC and (iii) outstanding units were canceled and instead entitle the holder thereof to, per unit, one share of common stock of Domesticated ABIC and one-half of one warrant of Domesticated ABIC; (b) on September 26, 2022, H-D and Legacy LiveWire consummated the separation of the Legacy LiveWire business and the other transactions contemplated by the Separation Agreement (the “Separation Agreement”), by and between H-D and Legacy LiveWire, dated as of September 26, 2022 (the “Separation”); (c) following the Domestication and immediately following the Separation, Merger Sub merged with and into Domesticated ABIC, with Domesticated ABIC surviving as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of LiveWire (the “Merger”), and LiveWire continuing as the public company in the Merger, with each share of common stock of Domesticated ABIC being converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive one share of LiveWire common stock, par value $0.0001 (“Common Stock”); (d) immediately following the Merger, H-D caused all of the membership interests of Legacy LiveWire (“Legacy LiveWire Equity”) held by ElectricSoul, LLC (the “Legacy LiveWire Equityholder”), a Delaware limited liability company and a subsidiary of H-D, to be contributed to LiveWire in exchange for 161,000,000 shares of Common Stock and the right to receive up to an additional 12,500,000 shares of Common Stock in the future (the “Earn-Out Shares”, and the transactions contemplated by this clause (d), collectively, the “Exchange”), and as a result of the Exchange, Legacy LiveWire became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of LiveWire; (e) immediately following the consummation of the Exchange, LiveWire contributed 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Legacy LiveWire to Domesticated ABIC (clauses (a) through (e) collectively, the “Business Combination”).
Holders of 36,597,112 of ABIC’s Class A Ordinary Shares sold in its initial public offering (the “Initial Shares”) exercised their right to have such shares redeemed for a full pro rata portion of the trust account holding the proceeds from ABIC’s initial public offering, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, which was approximately $10.06 per share, or $368.1 million in the aggregate.
An aggregate of $368.1 million was paid from the ABIC’s trust account to holders who exercised their right to have their Initial Shares redeemed, and the remaining balance immediately prior to the Closing of approximately $34 million remained in the trust account and was used to fund the Business Combination.
In connection with the Business Combination, the AEA-Bridges Impact Sponsor, LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company (the “Sponsor”), forfeited an aggregate of 2,000,000 Class B Ordinary Shares of ABIC in accordance with the Investor Support Agreement, dated as of December 12, 2021 (the “Investor Support Agreement”), by and among the Sponsor, LiveWire, ABIC, John Garcia, John Replogle and George Serafeim. The remaining Class B Ordinary Shares of ABIC held by the Sponsor automatically converted to 7,950,000 shares of Common Stock.
Pursuant to investment agreements entered into in connection with the Business Combination Agreement, Kwang Yang Motor Co., Ltd., KYMCO Capital Fund I Co., Ltd., SunBright Investment Co., Ltd., CycleLoop Co., Ltd. and Kwang Yang Holdings Limited (collectively, the “KYMCO Group”) agreed to subscribe for an aggregate of 10,000,000 newly-issued shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $100 million (the “KYMCO PIPE Investment”). 
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, and an investment agreement entered into prior to the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), the Legacy LiveWire Equityholder agreed to subscribe for an aggregate of 10,000,000 newly-issued shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $100 million (the “Legacy LiveWire Equityholder PIPE Investment” and, together with the KYMCO PIPE Investment, the “PIPE Investments”). At the closing of the Business Combination, LiveWire consummated the PIPE Investments. 
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, H-D caused the Legacy LiveWire Equityholder to pay and deliver to LiveWire an amount in cash equal to $100 million, which is the H-D Backstop Amount (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) in exchange for 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “H-D Backstop Shares”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per H-D Backstop Share. Additionally, H-D was reimbursed for $20.1 million of transaction costs and advisory fees incurred. 
After giving effect to the Business Combination, the redemption of Initial Shares as described above, the issuance of the H-D Backstop Shares and the consummation of the PIPE Investments, there were 202,402,888 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding.
The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Throughout this section, unless otherwise noted, the “Company”, “we,” “us” or “our” and similar terms refer to Legacy LiveWire and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, and LiveWire and its subsidiaries after the consummation of the Business Combination. References to ABIC refer to the SPAC entity prior to consummation of the Business Combination. Operating results for the periods presented prior to the consummation of the Business Combination represent those of Legacy LiveWire.
Vision and Growth Strategy
LiveWire’s vision is to lead the next generation of motorcycling with products that combine the experience of electric powertrains with the soulful connection that comes from riding a motorcycle. The underpinning strategy is to accelerate the electric vehicle transformation of the two-wheel industry while building a leadership position in the market. Directing the shift to electric vehicles is a mission-driven leadership team with the competitive advantages of being in the market ahead of other motorcycle companies and having a pipeline of future products. 
LiveWire’s Strategic Priorities
Lead in Electric and the Transformation of Motorcycling - The electric vehicle market will include both established manufacturers and new entrants. To establish market share and scale our business, LiveWire plans to continue building global distribution capabilities and make substantial investments in research and development for the commercialization of future generations of LiveWire electric motorcycles, related technologies and other products.
Capture Global Share of the Electric Motorcycle Market - LiveWire strategically selects our retail partners based upon their commitment to electric, location and capabilities to support the electric vehicle capture. Our 2023 priority markets include the United States and leading countries in Europe such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.
Lead in Brand Desirability - LiveWire’s ambition is to create the most desirable electric motorcycle brand in the world. As a brand, LiveWire leverages Soulful by Design as its consumer-facing position. This differentiates LiveWire from others in the 
category, showcasing a rider’s connection to the world through the LiveWire riding experience. LiveWire’s go-to-market model allows for a consumer-defined journey across digital and physical platforms for an omni-channel experience. 
In addition to the network of retail partners, LiveWire is currently making investments to provide potential customers with other opportunities to engage with the LiveWire brand and try LiveWire products. Our location in Malibu, California opened in February 2022, giving riders an additional venue to experience the LiveWire brand.
Share the Love of Riding - Since 2012, STACYC’s mission has been to Share the Love of Riding, designing and selling electric stability bikes for children, enabling the development of their skillset and powering their journey to independence on two wheels. STACYC’s portfolio includes four sizes of product for children ages 3 to 12. The company sells through powersports dealers, in addition to digital channels, while leveraging licensing deals with traditional powersport OEMs to increase reach and scale.
Strategic Partnerships
LiveWire benefits from two important strategic partners: H-D and the KYMCO Group. These partners have been selected based on their track record in their respective segments, the strength of their global capabilities, and the complementary fit with the LiveWire business. These partnerships give LiveWire a unique ability to deliver high-quality products to the global market in a capital-efficient approach.
H-D is one of the most recognized motorcycle brands in the world, with capabilities to design, develop, manufacture, market and distribute vehicles to major markets around the globe. Beyond the transitional service agreements tied to the Separation, LiveWire intends to leverage H-D’s capabilities in two key areas: technical and other services and contract manufacturing. 
The KYMCO Group sells a globally recognized brand of scooters, motorcycles and side-by-side ATVs. The KYMCO Group goes to market with a sales footprint covering over 100 countries, including a growing subset of electric vehicle-specific distribution points. In addition to core sales activities of the KYMCO Group brand, it is a trusted design and manufacturing partner to other premium two-wheel original equipment manufacturers.
LiveWire will draw on H-D’s and the KYMCO Group’s best-in-class operations, benefiting from knowledge, scale and infrastructure across material sourcing, electric vehicle building and global distribution.
Strategic Agreements with H-D
In connection with the Business Combination, we entered into a number of agreements with H-D to govern the Separation and provide a framework for the relationship between the parties going forward pursuant to which we and/or H-D have continuing obligations to each other. All transactions with H-D subsequent to the Business Combination are considered related party transactions. Agreements that the Company entered into in connection with the Separation include:
Transition Services Agreement
On September 26, 2022, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement with H-D (the “Transition Services Agreement”) pursuant to which H-D provides to us various services and support on a transitional basis to allow LiveWire to develop the capability to support ourselves or to engage a third-party provider to provide those services and support. 
The charges for the services are on a cost-plus basis (with a mark-up to reflect the management and administrative cost of providing the services). The services generally commenced on the date of the Separation and are intended to terminate between six and twelve months of the date of the Separation. We generally have the ability to (i) extend the term that a service is provided for by up to six months, subject to a maximum aggregate service term of 18 months; and (ii) terminate any or all services early subject to a 45-day notice period. H-D has the right to terminate the Transition Services Agreement for our non-payment of charges.
Master Services Agreement
On September 26, 2022, we entered into a Master Services Agreement with H-D (the “Master Services Agreement”) pursuant to which H-D provides us with certain services that we do not yet have the capability to perform for ourselves, including services related to testing and development, product regulatory support, color materials, finishes, paint and graphics, technical publication, application support and maintenance, service desk support, warehousing support, safety investigation, and marketing vehicle and fleet center, as we may request from time to time. The Master Services Agreement which contemplates that each of the services is set forth in a separate, mutually agreed upon statement of work. The Master Services Agreement has 
an initial term of seven years and will be renewable upon mutual agreement. The Master Services Agreement or any statement of work may be terminated by either party upon the other party’s material, uncured breach. H-D may also terminate the agreement upon LiveWire’s change of control or, at the end of a calendar year, in the event that LiveWire failed to engage H-D to manufacture at least forty percent of LiveWire’s production during that calendar year. The charges for the services are on a cost-plus basis (with a mark-up of eight percent to reflect the management and administrative cost of providing the services). 
Contract Manufacturing Agreement
On September 26, 2022, we entered into a Contract Manufacturing Agreement with H-D (the “Contract Manufacturing Agreement”) pursuant to which H-D provides contract manufacturing and procurement services to us for the products in our LiveWire platform, as well as future anticipated platforms. H-D is our exclusive manufacturer for these platforms for five years from the date that H-D begins manufacturing the relevant platform (and five years from the Separation for the LiveWire platform). Following this exclusivity period, we may terminate the agreement for one or more products within the relevant platform upon two years’ notice, subject to payment of certain termination charges (which are intended to compensate H-D for its capital investment and other sunken costs). The Contract Manufacturing Agreement may also be terminated, in whole or part, by either party upon the other party’s material, uncured breach, inability to perform its obligations for more than six months due to a force majeure event, bankruptcy or insolvency, or change of control.
Beginning for calendar year 2024, LiveWire will be subject to a minimum annual volume commitment for each product and pay a deficit fee for failure to meet the minimum under the Contract Manufacturing Agreement. The products that H-D manufactures for us are priced on a cost-plus basis, with a mark-up of six percent of H-D’s cost for manufacturing the relevant product. An operational committee consisting of designated employees of each party will meet quarterly for administrative purposes, including for the review of changes to pricing, minimum volumes and other terms. H-D will procure, on our behalf, equipment and materials that are used in both H-D’s and our products, and we will procure all other equipment and materials, as well as tooling, needed to manufacture the products.
Intellectual Property License Agreement
On September 26, 2022, we entered into an Intellectual Property License Agreement with H-D (the “Intellectual Property License Agreement”) pursuant to which each party granted to the other party a license to certain intellectual property on a perpetual, non-exclusive basis for the purpose of making and selling the licensee’s products.
H-D perpetually licenses to us all H-D intellectual property (other than marks or software) used in our business as of the Separation and certain additional specified intellectual property, as well as all improvements to the foregoing (but excluding (i) any H-D manufacturing intellectual property and (ii) intellectual property relating to motorcycle riding apparel and related general merchandise). We perpetually license to H-D all intellectual property (other than marks or software) that we own as of the Separation and all improvements thereto. If either party makes improvements to the other party’s IP, such improvements will be jointly owned by the parties.
The licenses are generally royalty-free. However, if either party desires to exercise its license with respect to improvements introduced by the other party in next-generation vehicles (rather than a “carry over” or a “model refresh”), then the parties will mutually agree in good faith on a reasonable royalty to be paid. In addition, if H-D desires to sell any products that incorporate our intellectual property outside of the Large Cruiser, Touring and Adventure Touring markets during the seven-year period following the Separation, the parties will mutually agree in good faith on a reasonable royalty to be paid on such sales (but not on sales relating to LiveWire-branded H-D motorcycles or related LiveWire parts and accessories).
Each party owns improvements that it creates to its own intellectual property, and the parties jointly own improvements that one party creates to the other party’s intellectual property, without a right of accounting.
Trademark License Agreement
On September 26, 2022, we entered into a Trademark License Agreement with H-D (the “Trademark License Agreement”) pursuant to which H-D granted to us a royalty-free license to use certain H-D trademarks with respect to our products. The Trademark License Agreement has an initial term of two years and automatically renews for successive two-year periods unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least 60 days prior to the end of the then-current term. H-D may terminate the agreement earlier upon our breach under certain circumstances, our bankruptcy or insolvency, or our unpermitted assignment of the agreement.
Joint Development Agreement
On September 26, 2022 we entered into a Joint Development Agreement with H-D (the “Joint Development Agreement”) pursuant to which the parties may agree to engage in joint development projects, which would be set forth in one or more mutually agreed project work statements. The Joint Development Agreement remains in effect until we and H-D mutually agree to terminate it and can be terminated earlier by either party upon the other party’s material, uncured breach.
Under the Joint Development Agreement, H-D is required to notify us of any development projects for H-D’s business that are primarily related to electric vehicles, and we have the right to make a proposal with respect to the joint development of such a project. The parties will discuss in good faith whether or not it is beneficial for the parties to enter into a joint development project with respect to such project. If H-D engages in any development projects that are primarily related to electric vehicles and fails to consult with us so that we can make a proposal with respect such potential project, then the intellectual property developed pursuant to such H-D development project will be owned and licensed in accordance with the default intellectual property terms of the agreement (described below). Unless we and H-D agree otherwise for a particular project, each party bears its own costs and expenses in connection with each project under the Joint Development agreement.
Unless otherwise mutually agreed for a particular project under the Joint Development Agreement, we own project intellectual property relating exclusively to electric vehicles and H-D owns all other project intellectual property. Each party is granted a perpetual license to use the project intellectual property in connection with that party’s products, which, for us, are limited to two-, three- or four-wheeled electric vehicles, related parts and accessories and electric vehicle systems.
Tax Matters Agreement
On September 26, 2022, LiveWire entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with H-D (the “Tax Matters Agreement”). The Tax Matters Agreement sets forth the principles and responsibilities regarding the allocation of taxes, adjustments with respect to taxes, preparation of tax returns, tax audits and certain other tax matters that affect LiveWire and H-D in the event LiveWire or any of its subsidiaries become members of any of H-D’s consolidated, combined, unitary and other similar groups for federal, state or local income tax purposes (or LiveWire has certain income, gain, loss and deduction included in the tax returns of such groups). LiveWire and its subsidiaries are currently members of H-D’s consolidated, combined, unitary and other similar groups for federal, state and local income tax purposes.
With respect to U.S. federal income tax returns for any taxable period in which LiveWire (or any of its subsidiaries) are included in H-D’s consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of taxes to be paid by us is generally determined, subject to certain adjustments, as if LiveWire and each of its subsidiaries filed its own separate consolidated federal income tax return (LiveWire’s “separate federal tax liability”). With respect to state and local income tax returns for any taxable period in which LiveWire or any of its subsidiaries are included in H-D’s combined, consolidated or unitary group for state or local income tax purposes, the amount of taxes to be paid by LiveWire is determined, subject to certain adjustments using principles analogous to the principles used to compute LiveWire’s separate federal tax liability, as if LiveWire and each of its subsidiaries included in such combined, consolidated or unitary group filed its own combined, consolidated or unitary group state or local income tax return.
LiveWire’s inclusion in H-D’s consolidated group may result in H-D utilizing certain tax attributes that LiveWire generates, including net operating losses, and LiveWire will receive no compensation from H-D for the use of such attributes.
The Tax Matters Agreement applies as of the closing of the Business Combination, which is the date that H-D’s ownership of LiveWire met the applicable minimum threshold required to file either a combined return or a consolidated return and will remain in effect unless the parties agree in writing to terminate the agreement. Notwithstanding any termination of the Tax Matters Agreement, the agreement will continue in effect with respect to any payment or indemnification due for all taxable periods prior to the termination during which the Tax Matters Agreement was in effect.
Electric Motorcycles Segment 
The Electric Motorcycles segment focuses on the development and sales of electric motorcycles as well as parts, accessories, and apparel. Electric motorcycles are sold by combining both digital and physical touchpoint, including to a network of independent retailers, and at retail direct to consumers through a Company-owned dealer, and through online sales.
Electric Motorcycles segment revenue by product line for the last three fiscal years was as follows (in thousands):
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Electric motorcycles | $ | 13,171 | | | $ | 8,706 | | $ | 12,846
Parts, accessories and apparel | 828 | | | 999 | | | 1,473
Revenue, net | $ | 13,999 | | | $ | 9,705 | | $ | 14,319

Electric Motorcycles – The Electric Motorcycles segment sells electric powered motorcycles under the LiveWire brand. LiveWire launched the LiveWire ONE model in July 2021. The electric motorcycles are developed in accordance with a set of proprietary design principles that elevate the brand, deliver differentiated riding experiences and bring emotion to electric propulsion. Starting from the LiveWire ONE, the portfolio will expand on our ARROW architecture. This approach establishes a path to grow the product set, beginning with the System2 (“S2”) Del Mar, to meet a broad set of segments and price points. ARROW was developed in-house to take advantage of the benefits of scalable, modular architectures across the electric vehicle, electric vehicle systems and software. ARROW is an integrated vehicle architecture, utilizing the battery pack and motor as the primary vehicle structure to deliver simple, elegant lightweight designs. 
The software backbone that supports every LiveWire electric motorcycle is developed ground-up to maximize efficiency and performance, integrating all electric vehicle systems and vehicle functions. The electric motorcycle connects to the cloud through a telematics control unit (“TCU”) with built-in cellular connectivity. The connection enables remote monitoring of the vehicle, with status data including charge, range and tamper alerts. The LiveWire app allows riders to interact with the electric motorcycle, delivering maps, audio and ride planning via an integrated user profile. LiveWire Connect remotely bridges the rider to the bike using built-in cellular connectivity and GPS, providing status, notifications, and alerts. In combination with the cloud system and the TCU, the mobile app enables an ecosystem of services provided to LiveWire electric motorcycle riders.
We expect our introduction of Firmware Over the Air (“FOTA”) to allow for continual upgrades and refinements to the electric motorcycle in the field, greatly reducing the need and inconvenience for service or repair appointments for setting or software updates. With FOTA-enabled electronic control units on the vehicle, each subsystem becomes remotely addressable and updatable. In addition to the benefits to the Electric Motorcycles segment as the original equipment manufacturers, FOTA capability enables remote updates to bring the rider new features, functionality and enhancements as they are developed to continually improve the LiveWire electric motorcycle riding and ownership experience.
Industry – The relevant internal combustion engine (“ICE”) and electric vehicle markets for the Electric Motorcycles segment include:
•Small and large scooters
•Light, medium and heavy weight motorcycles
•Three-wheeled motorcycles and automobiles
•Side-by-side ATVs and four-wheelers
Competition – The Electric Motorcycles segment expects competition from two primary segments:
•Leading ICE-focused motorcycle companies: These incumbent motorcycle companies have the ability to scale manufacturing and leverage global distribution capabilities but do not currently offer any premium electric motorcycles in the market. However, some of these companies are beginning to explore entering the electric motorcycle market through electric motorcycle races or beginning to develop prototype models.
•Small scale electric mobility companies: These start-ups and smaller companies may have products in the market today, but typically lack the global manufacturing and distribution capabilities of the major ICE players.
While we expect competition to grow as the market shifts to electric, and more players begin to make serious investments, we believe the Electric Motorcycles segment is the only player and established brand with the combination of technology, manufacturing, and market position to lead the growing electric motorcycle market.
Parts, accessories, and apparel – Parts, accessories, and apparel products include replacement parts and mechanical and cosmetic accessories, clothing and accessories.
Marketing – The Electric Motorcycles segment’s brand, products and the riding experience are marketed to consumers in the United States and select international markets. Marketing occurs primarily through digital and experiential activities as well as through more traditional promotional and advertising activities. The Electric Motorcycles segment is making investments to provide potential customers with many other opportunities to engage with the brand and try Electric Motorcycles segment products. Additionally, the Electric Motorcycles segment’s dealers engage in a wide range of local marketing and events.
Seasonality – The seasonality of the Electric Motorcycles segment’s wholesale motorcycle shipments generally correlates with the timing of retail sales made by dealers. Retail sales generally track closely with regional riding seasons, generally from mid-March through August. 
Electric Motorcycle Manufacturing – The Electric Motorcycles segment leverages its strategic partners to enable an asset-light approach which allows the business to scale with less investment than would be necessary if it had its own manufacturing operations. The Electric Motorcycles segment purchases electric motorcycles from H-D through the Contract Manufacturing Agreement. The LiveWire ONE is assembled at H-D’s facility in York, Pennsylvania. With the introduction of the S2 platform, LiveWire powertrains will be assembled in H-D’s Powertrain Operations in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, and overall vehicle assembly will continue to be in the York facility alongside the LiveWire ONE.
Raw Materials and Purchased Components – The Electric Motorcycles segment continues to establish and reinforce long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with its suppliers. Through these collaborative relationships, the Electric Motorcycles segment gains access to technical and commercial resources for application directly to product design, development and manufacturing initiatives. In addition, through a continued focus on collaboration and strong supplier relationships, the Electric Motorcycles segment believes it is positioned to achieve its strategic objectives and deliver cost and quality improvements over the long-term. 
The principal raw materials in Electric Motorcycles segment’s products include battery cells, semi-conductor chips, steel and aluminum castings, forgings, steel sheet and bar. Additional raw materials in Electric Motorcycles segment’s products include certain motorcycle components including, but not limited to, batteries, tires, seats, electrical components, instruments and wheels. The Electric Motorcycles segment closely monitors the overall viability of its supply base. The Electric Motorcycles segment is proactively working with its suppliers in an effort to minimize disruptions resulting from supply chain challenges.
STACYC Segment
The STACYC segment primarily focuses on the designing and selling of electric balance bikes for kids. The STACYC segment products are sold at wholesale to independent dealers and independent distributors, as well as, direct to consumers online.
STACYC segment revenue by product line for the last three fiscal years was as follows (in thousands):
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Electric balance bikes | $ | 29,669 | | | $ | 23,130 | | $ | 14,602
Parts, accessories and apparel | 3,165 | | | 2,971 | | | 1,942
Revenue, net | $ | 32,834 | | | $ | 26,101 | | $ | 16,544

Electric Balance Bikes – STACYC focuses on developing products and experiences that help kids develop sooner and empower them to define their own ride. STACYC sells electric balance bikes under the STACYC brand while working with brand partners on co-branded products. 
The product portfolio starts with 12- and 16-inch electric balance bikes built for 3- to 8-year-old riders. With a growing segment of young riders graduating out of the 16-inch product, during 2022, we introduced the 18- and 20-inch electric balance bikes that expanded the range of STACYC riders from 3 to 12 years old.
Industry/Competition – STACYC is a category creator, and while there have been some competitors who have entered the market, their products lack STACYC’s product maturity and features, and their distribution generally lacks the breadth of the STACYC network. STACYC sponsors and supports off road racing events across the nation and is the first and only motorized vehicle allowed on USA BMX’s 300 tracks in the U.S., allowing kids to practice and race in USA BMX’s national series. While we expect competition to grow as the market shifts to younger riders and more players begin to make serious investments, we believe STACYC'’s established brand with the combination of commitment, capabilities and market position positions STACYC to compete effectively in the growing electric balance bike market.
Parts, accessories, and apparel – Parts and accessories products include replacement parts and mechanical and cosmetic accessories, clothing and riding gear.
Marketing – STACYC’s brand, products and the riding experience are marketed to consumers worldwide. Marketing occurs primarily through digital and experiential activities as well as through more traditional promotional and advertising activities. Additionally, STACYC’s dealers, distributors, and OEM partners engage in a wide range of local and global marketing and events.
Seasonality – The seasonality of STACYC’s electric balance bike sales generally correlates with the timing of retail sales made by dealers. Retail sales generally track closely with regional riding and holiday purchasing seasons, generally from mid-March through December.
Manufacturing – STACYC purchases electric balance bikes through a contract manufacturing agreement from strategic partners and bike assemblers located in Taiwan.
Purchased Components – STACYC continues to establish and reinforce long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with its suppliers. Through these collaborative relationships, STACYC gains access to technical and commercial resources for application directly to product design, development and manufacturing initiatives. 
Human Capital Management

The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards to eligible employees to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. All of our exempt associates participate in our cash-based incentive plans, which provides eligible associates with cash bonus opportunities based upon the Company’s achievement of financial and other key performance metrics. Under the LiveWire Group, Inc. 2022 Incentive Award Plan (the “Incentive Award Plan”), we grant equity compensation awards, such as restricted stock units and performance awards, which vest over a period of time, to eligible associates to attract and retain key personnel, strengthen their commitment to the welfare of the Company, and align their interests with those of our stockholders. In December 2022, the Company extended ownership to all employees by making a one-time equity grant, including to those employees that are not otherwise eligible for equity grants. Additionally, our comprehensive health and welfare benefits program provides our employees with a variety of medical and dental plans, plus voluntary benefits like vision or critical illness protection.

Certain of our operations, properties and products are subject to stringent and comprehensive international, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing matters including environmental protection, occupational health and safety, and the release or discharge of materials into the environment (including air emissions and wastewater discharges). Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas.
We are also subject to permitting, registration, and other government approval requirements under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Those requirements obligate us to obtain permits, registrations, and other government approvals from one or more governmental agencies to conduct our operations and sell our products. The requirements vary depending on the location where our regulated activities are conducted.
The following summarizes certain existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our operations and products.
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) Safety and Self-Certification Obligations. As a manufacturer of electric vehicles, our electric vehicles are subject to, and must comply with, numerous regulatory requirements established by NHTSA, including all applicable United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“Safety Standards”). As set forth by the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, we must certify that our electric vehicles meet all applicable Safety Standards. The LiveWire ONE is, the LiveWire S2, and future products will be at the time of production, fully compliant with all such Safety Standards without the need for any exemptions.
We are also required to comply with or demonstrate exemptions from other requirements of federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the consumer information labeling and owner’s manual requirements and various reporting requirements, such as “early warning” reports regarding warranty claims and field incidents, death and injury reports, foreign recall reports and safety defects reports. In addition, our products are also subject to certain laws and regulations that have been enacted or proposed, e.g., “Right to Repair,” laws, that could require us to provide third-party access to our network and/or vehicle systems.
Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) Certificate of Conformity. The Clean Air Act requires that we obtain an EPA-issued Certificate of Conformity and a certification from the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) with respect to emissions from our electric vehicles, and include labeling providing consumer information such as miles per gallon of gas-equivalent ratings and maximum range on a single charge. The Certificate of Conformity is required each model year for electric vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards, and is also required each model year for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards.
Battery Safety and Testing. Our battery packs are tested in accordance with industry safety standards, including selected tests specified in the SAE J2464 and J2929 standards as well as tests defined by other standards and regulatory bodies and LiveWire’s own internal safety and quality tests. These tests evaluate battery function and performance as well as resilience to conditions including immersion, humidity, fire and other potential hazards.
Hazardous Substances. We are subject to regulations governing the proper handling, storage, transportation and disposal of products containing hazardous substances. Transportation of our battery packs (and of equipment containing them) is governed by regulations that address risks posed during different modes of transport (e.g.¸ air, rail, ground, ocean). Governing transportation regulations in the U.S., issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), are based on the United Nations (“UN”) Recommendations and Model Regulations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods as well as related UN Manual Tests and Criteria. We have completed the applicable UN Manual tests for our production battery packs, and the test results demonstrate our compliance with the PHMSA regulations.
We currently use transition metal oxide cells in our high-voltage battery packs. Our battery packs include certain packaging materials that contain trace amounts of hazardous chemicals whose use, storage and disposal is regulated under federal law. As a result, our battery packs are subject to federal and state environmental laws and regulations that govern regarding the handling and disposal of waste, including, in some instances, the remanufacture, recycling and disposal of hazardous waste.
The laws governing hazardous substances and hazardous waste also may impose strict, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. In the course of ordinary operations, we, directly and through third parties and contractors, may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar federal and state statutes and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which any such hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
Workplace Safety. Our operations are also subject to federal, state, and local workplace safety laws and regulations, including the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Act, and equivalent laws and regulations, which require compliance with various workplace safety requirements, including requirements related to environmental safety. These laws and regulations can give rise to liability for oversight costs, compliance costs, bodily injury (including workers’ compensation), fines, and penalties. Additionally, non-compliance could result in delay or suspension of production or cessation of operations.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations in the European Union
Europe Type Approval. We intend to export electric vehicles to Europe. Unlike the United States, once we start operating in this market, we must obtain pre-approval from regulators to import and sell our electric vehicles into the EU and countries that recognize EU certification or have regulatory regimes aligned with the EU (collectively referred to as “Europe”). The process for certification in Europe is known as “Type Approval” and requires LiveWire to demonstrate to a regulatory agency in the EU, referred to as the Competent Authority, that our electric vehicles meet all EU safety and emission standards.
Type Approval is accomplished through witness testing of vehicles as well as inspection of a representative vehicle intended for production and sale. Once the vehicle type is approved, all vehicles manufactured based on the approved type of vehicle may be produced or imported and sold in Europe.
Any changes to an approved vehicle type, including substantial software changes, must go through updated Type Approval by the Competent Authority.
EU Emissions Regulations. We believe Europe’s regulatory environment is generally conducive to the development, production and sale of electric vehicles. Through emission legislation, tax incentives and direct subsidies, EU and non-EU countries in Europe are taking a progressive stance in reducing carbon emissions in the transport sector which may lead to increasing demand for electric vehicles.
This is reflected in the EU-wide target of a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels), as part of an economy-wide carbon-neutral target. Moving forward, the European Parliament and European Council have provisionally agreed legislation in the final quarter of 2022 that would (i) introduce a pricing emissions trading system that is anticipated to apply to the transport sector from as soon as 2027 (subject to a one year delay if energy prices in the EU exceed certain amounts); (ii) require increased levels of national greenhouse gas reduction commitments (which include the transport sector) pursuant to a revision of the Effort Sharing Regulation, as part of efforts to reduce EU emissions by 40% by 2030 (compared to 2005 levels) in certain sectors including transport and by 55% overall by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels); and (iii) will amend the EU legislative regime with respect to batteries, including by introducing mandatory supply chain due diligence obligations with respect to certain materials used in our batteries. Such agreements are pending formal adoption by EU political institutions.
The EU has further developed a system of “off-ramps” pursuant to which manufacturers can earn “super credits” for delivering to the market zero- and low-emission vehicles emitting less than a certain threshold of pollutants. In addition, manufacturers can group together or pool their fleets and act jointly to meet their emissions target. This method of compliance may allow LiveWire to “sell” its credits and super credits to a manufacturer seeking to enter into a pooling arrangement. However, unlike the United States, in the EU, LiveWire cannot sell individual credits.
Hazardous Substances. Should we expand into the EU, we would also be subject to regulations governing the proper handling, and disposal of products containing hazardous substances in the EU, including the EU Waste Framework Directive, in relation to which the European Commission has begun a consultation process to revise. In relation to our batteries, disposal would be governed by the Batteries Directive, which imposes, among other obligations, certain requirements in relation to the disposal of batteries, such as that producers of batteries and producers of other products that incorporate a battery are responsible for the waste management of batteries that they place on the market, in particular the financing of collection and recycling schemes.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations in the Rest of World
Should we expand into jurisdictions outside of the USA and EU, other jurisdictions also have a favorable regulatory environment with respect to electric motorcycles.
For example, in the UK, the government has proposed that all new motorcycles are to be fully zero emissions at the tailpipe from 2035, or earlier if it is determined that a faster transition seems feasible. This proposal is subject to feedback from a consultation process but reflects the UK’s broader strategy to phase out new combustion engines in all transport (including heavy duty vehicles) by 2040.
Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation
State laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale, and service (including delivery) of motorcycles and generally require vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed to sell vehicles directly to customers in the state.
Some states, however, do not permit motorcycle manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer. To sell vehicles directly to residents of these states, we must conduct the sale out of state through our California location, over the internet or telephonically. LiveWire retail partners who have obtained dealer licenses within these certain states will sell vehicles directly to residents within these states.
In addition, certain states and territories require service facilities to be available for vehicles sold in the state or territory, which may be interpreted to require service facilities to be available for vehicles sold through our California location over the internet or telephonically to residents of the state or territory. Puerto Rico, for example, is one such jurisdiction. Such laws could limit our ability to sell vehicles in states either where we do not maintain service facilities or where we do not have retail partners licensed to act as service dealers who maintain appropriate service facilities within these states.
We believe that, as a matter of interstate commerce, we may sell an electric vehicle to any consumer in any state in the United States from a LiveWire retail partner that is duly licensed as a dealer by a state in the United States. That customer may contact a licensed LiveWire retail partner through the internet, by telephone or visiting the location directly. However, some states may take an alternative approach or interpretation and attempt to prohibit direct sales and/or also restrict traditional marketing, pre-sale and/or sales activities.
Data Privacy and Cybersecurity Laws and Regulations
Our business collects, uses, handles, stores, receives, transmits and otherwise processes different types of information about a range of individuals, including our customers, riders of our electric vehicles, website visitors, users of our mobile application, our employees and job applicants, and employees of companies we do business with (such as our vendors and suppliers). As a result, we are and may become subject to existing and emerging federal, state, local and international laws and regulations related to the privacy, security and protection of such information, such as the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Act, the GLBA, the TCPA, the CAN-SPAM Act, California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA”), the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”), the Connecticut Data Privacy Rights Act (“CTDPA”) and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (“UCPA”).
In the United States, while there is not a single generally applicable federal law governing the processing of personal information, there are federal laws that apply to the processing of certain types of information, or the processing of personal information by certain types of entities, and the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general may bring enforcement actions against companies that engage in processing of personal information in a manner that constitutes an “unfair” or “deceptive” trade practice.
In addition, certain states have enacted laws relating to data privacy and the processing of information about residents in those states. The CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020 and applies to our business, imposes obligations and restrictions on businesses that handle personal information of California residents and provides data privacy rights to California residents, including the right to know, the right to delete and the right to opt out of the sale of personal information as well as additional protections for minors. Certain requirements in the CCPA remain uncertain due to ambiguities in the drafting of the CCPA or incomplete guidance. Adding to the uncertainty, in November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which amends and expands upon the CCPA, imposes additional obligations and sets forth additional privacy rights for California residents. Additional states, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah, also recently enacted comprehensive data privacy laws. Virginia passed the VCDPA, Colorado passed the CPA, Connecticut passed the CTDPA and Utah passed the UCPA. The CPRA and VCDPA became effective on January 1, 2023, the CPA and CTDPA become effective on July 1, 2023 
and the UCPA becomes effective on December 31, 2023. There are currently draft CPRA regulations and draft CPA rules that, when passed, will supplement the CPRA and CPA. Additionally, laws, regulations, and standards covering marketing and advertising activities conducted by telephone, email, mobile devices, and the Internet may be applicable to our business, such as the TCPA, the CAN-SPAM Act and similar state and federal consumer protection laws. We are also subject to certain laws and regulations that have been enacted or proposed, such as “Right to Repair” laws, that could require us to provide third-party access to our network and/or vehicle systems.
By expanding into Europe and the United Kingdom, we will also become subject to laws, regulations and standards covering data protection and marketing and advertising, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the United Kingdom data protection regime, consisting primarily of the UK General Data Protection Regulation and the UK Data Protection Act (together referred to as the “UK GDPR”). The GDPR and UK GDPR regulate the processing of data relating to an identifiable individual (personal data) and impose stringent data protection requirements on organizations with significant penalties for noncompliance. The European Data Protection Board has also released data guidelines for connected vehicles, and the upcoming ePrivacy Regulation is in its final stages.
Regulators and legislators in jurisdictions around the world continue to propose and enact more stringent data protection and privacy laws. New laws as well as any significant changes to applicable laws, regulations, interpretations of laws or regulations, or market practices regarding privacy and data protection or regarding the manner in which we seek to comply with applicable laws and regulations could require us to make modifications to our products, services, policies, procedures, notices and business practices. Many large geographies that may become important to our future success, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China and India, have passed or are considering comprehensive data privacy legislation or regulations. Until prevailing compliance practices standardize, the impact of worldwide privacy regulations on our business and, consequently, our revenue, could be negatively impacted.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is a core asset of our company, and an important tool to drive value and differentiation in our products and services. We protect, use and defend our intellectual property in support of our business objectives to increase our return on investment, enhance our competitive position, and create stockholder value. Through strategic and business assessments of our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, service marks, trademarks, domains, contractual terms and enforcement mechanisms across various international jurisdictions to establish and protect intellectual property related to our current and future business and operations.
As of December 31, 2022, we held 9 utility patents and 20 design patents, and had filed an additional 8 utility patent applications and 3 design patent applications in the U.S. We also held 45 patents and 11 patent applications that are foreign counterparts of some of our U.S. patents and patent applications with foreign patent offices. We do not view any individual patent as being material to our business. Subject to required payments of annuities or maintenance fees, United States design patents have a term of 15 years from the date of issuance, and United States utility patents have a term of 20 years from the priority application date. Accordingly, our U.S. patents that have already been issued will expire between 2031 and 2040. Our foreign patents generally have similar expiration dates, but may vary from country to country, the duration being set according to the laws of the jurisdiction in which the patent issues. Our trademarks, logos, domain names, and service marks are used to establish and maintain our reputation with our customers, and the goodwill associated with our businesses. As of December 31, 2022, we had 38 registered trademarks and had an additional 30 pending trademark applications with domestic and foreign trademark offices. The duration of trademark registrations vary from country to country, but it is typically for ten years with unlimited ten-year renewal terms, subject to the payment of maintenance and renewal fees and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the trademark is registered.
We intend to continue to vigorously pursue intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be advantageous to our business objectives. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, we may be unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property, and third parties may seek to circumvent invalidate, or otherwise challenge our intellectual property.
