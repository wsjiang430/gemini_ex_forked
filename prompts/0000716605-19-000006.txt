ITEM 1 | BUSINESS

A. General Development of Business and History

On January 7, 1983, Penns Woods Bancorp, Inc. (the “Corporation”) was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a bank holding company. In connection with the organization of the Corporation, Jersey Shore State Bank ("JSSB"), a Pennsylvania state-chartered bank, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation.  On June 1, 2013, the Corporation acquired Luzerne Bank ("Luzerne") with Luzerne operating as a subsidiary of the Corporation (JSSB and Luzerne are collectively referred to as the "Banks"). The Corporation’s two other wholly-owned subsidiaries are Woods Real Estate Development Company, Inc. and Woods Investment Company, Inc.  The Corporation is also a partner in United Insurance Solutions, LLC. The Corporation’s business has consisted primarily of managing and supervising the Banks, and its principal source of income has been dividends paid by the Banks and Woods Investment Company, Inc.

The Banks are engaged in commercial and retail banking which includes the acceptance of time, savings, and demand deposits, the funding of commercial, consumer, and mortgage loans, and safe deposit services.  Utilizing a branch office network, ATMs, Internet, and telephone banking delivery channels, the Banks deliver their products and services to the communities they reside in.
In October 2000, JSSB acquired The M Group, Inc. D/B/A The Comprehensive Financial Group (“The M Group”). The M Group, which operates as a subsidiary of JSSB, offers insurance and securities brokerage services. Securities are offered by The M Group through Voya Financial, a registered broker-dealer.
Neither the Corporation nor the Banks anticipate that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will have any material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or their competitive position.  The Banks are not dependent on a single customer or a few customers, the loss of whom would have a material effect on the business of the Banks.
JSSB employed 251 persons, Luzerne employed 73 persons, and The M Group employed 4 persons as of December 31, 2018 in either a full-time or part-time capacity.  The Corporation does not have any employees.  The principal officers of the Banks also serve as officers of the Corporation.
Woods Investment Company, Inc., a Delaware holding company, maintains an investment portfolio that is managed for total return and to fund dividend payments by the Corporation.
Woods Real Estate Development Company, Inc. serves the Corporation through its acquisition and ownership of certain properties utilized by the Bank.

United Insurance Solutions, LLC offers property and casualty and auto insurance products within the Corporation's market footprint.
We post publicly available reports required to be filed with the SEC on our website, www.pwod.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such reports with the SEC.  The required reports are available free of charge through our website.  Information available on our website is not part of or incorporated by reference into this Report or any other report filed by this Corporation with the SEC.
B. Regulation and Supervision

The Corporation is a registered bank holding company and, as such is subject to the provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”) and to supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”).  During 2017, the Corporation elected to become a financial holding company under the BHCA and the regulations of the FRB. The Banks are also subject to the supervision and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), as their primary federal regulator and as the insurer of the Banks' deposits.  The Banks are also regulated and examined by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the “Department”).
The insurance activities of The M Group are subject to regulation by the insurance departments of the various states in which The M Group conducts business, including principally the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance. The securities brokerage activities of The M Group are subject to regulation by federal and state securities commissions.
The insurance activities of United Insurance Solutions, LLC are subject to regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance.

The FRB has issued regulations under the BHCA that require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks.  As a result, the FRB, pursuant to such regulations, may require the Corporation to stand ready to use its resources to provide adequate capital funds to the Banks during periods of financial stress or adversity.  The BHCA requires the Corporation to secure the prior approval of the FRB before it can acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or acquire ownership or control of 5% or more of any voting shares of any bank.  Such a transaction would also require approval of the Department.
A bank holding company is prohibited under the BHCA from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of, more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in non-banking activities unless the FRB, by order or regulation, has found such activities to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.  Under the BHCA, the FRB has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary (other than a non-bank subsidiary of a bank) upon the FRB’s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.
In July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted revisions to the agencies’ capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules, which were designed to enhance such requirements and implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly referred to as Basel III. The final rules generally implement higher minimum capital requirements, add a new common equity tier 1 capital requirement, and establish criteria that instruments must meet to be considered common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital or tier 2 capital. The current minimum capital requirements are a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% (6.5% to be considered “well capitalized”), a tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%; (8.0% to be considered “well capitalized”), and a total capital ratio of 8.0% (10.0% to be considered “well capitalized”). In order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), as of January 1, 2019, a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets. 
In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the FRB requires each bank holding company to comply with the leverage ratio, under which the bank holding company must maintain a minimum level of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets of 4.0% (5.0% to be considered "well capitalized"). The Banks are subject to similar capital requirements adopted by the FDIC.

Dividends

Federal and state laws impose limitations on the payment of dividends by the Banks. The Pennsylvania Banking Code and the policies of the FDIC and the Department generally encourage the Banks to pay dividends from current net income and retained earnings. The Pennsylvania Banking Code restricts the availability of capital funds for payment of dividends by the Banks to their additional paid-in capital.
In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the banking regulators have the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the Banks if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the Banks.
Under Pennsylvania law, the Corporation may not pay a dividend, if, after giving effect thereto, it would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business and, after giving effect to the dividend, the total assets of the Corporation would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the Corporation were to be dissolved at the time of distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose rights are superior to those receiving the dividend.
It is also the policy of the FRB that a bank holding company generally may only pay dividends on common stock out of net income available to common shareholders over the past twelve months and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with a bank holding company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. A bank holding company also should not maintain a dividend level that places undue pressure on the capital of such institution’s subsidiaries, or that may undermine the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength for such subsidiaries.
C. Regulation of the Banks

The Banks are highly regulated by the FDIC and the Department.  The laws that such agencies enforce limit the specific types of businesses in which the Banks may engage, and the products and services that the Banks may offer to customers.  Generally, these limitations are designed to protect the insurance fund of the FDIC and/or the customers of the Banks, and not the Banks or their shareholders.  From time to time, various types of new federal and state legislation have been proposed that could result in additional regulation of, and restrictions on, the business of the Banks. It cannot be predicted whether any such legislation will be adopted 
4

or how such legislation would affect business of the Banks.  As a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in the United States, the Banks' business is particularly susceptible to being affected by federal legislation and regulations that may increase the costs of doing business.  Some of the major regulatory provisions that affect the business of the Banks are discussed briefly below.
Prompt Corrective Action
The FDIC has specified the levels at which an insured institution will be considered “well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.” In the event an institution’s capital deteriorates to the “undercapitalized” category or below, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”) and FDIC regulations prescribe an increasing amount of regulatory intervention, including: (1) the institution of a capital restoration plan by a bank and a guarantee of the plan by a parent institution and liability for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitment on that guarantee; and (2) the placement of a hold on increases in assets, number of branches, or lines of business.  If capital has reached the significantly or critically undercapitalized levels, further material restrictions can be imposed, including restrictions on interest payable on accounts, dismissal of management and (in critically undercapitalized situations) appointment of a receiver.  For well-capitalized institutions, the FDIA provides authority for regulatory intervention where the institution is deemed to be engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or receives a less than satisfactory examination report rating for asset quality, management, earnings or liquidity.
Deposit Insurance
The FDIC maintains the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The FDIC has set the amount of deposits it insures at $250,000. 
As mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the assessment base that the FDIC uses to calculate assessment premiums is a bank’s average assets minus average tangible equity.  The range of assessment rates is a low of 2.5 basis points to a high of 45 basis points, per $100 of assets.
The FDIC is required under the Dodd-Frank Act to establish assessment rates that will allow the DIF to achieve a reserve ratio of 1.35% of insured deposits by September 2020.  In addition, the FDIC has established a “designated reserve ratio” of 2.0%, a target ratio that, until it is achieved, will not likely result in the FDIC reducing assessment rates.  In attempting to achieve the mandated 1.35% ratio, the FDIC is required to implement assessment formulas that charge banks over $10 billion in asset size more than banks under that size.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC is authorized to make reimbursements from the insurance fund to banks if the reserve ratio exceeds 1.50%, but the FDIC has adopted the “designated reserve ratio” of 2.0% and has announced that any reimbursements from the fund are indefinitely suspended.
Federal Home Loan Bank System
The Banks are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (the “FHLB”), which is one of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region.  It is funded primarily from funds deposited by member institutions and proceeds from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank.  At December 31, 2018, the Banks had $138,625,000 in FHLB advances.
As a member, the Banks are required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB. The amount of required stock varies based on the FHLB products utilized by the Banks and the amount of the products utilized.  At December 31, 2018, the Banks had $18,357,000 in stock of the FHLB, which was in compliance with this requirement.
Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018
On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”), amended certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as certain other statutes administered by the federal banking agencies. Some of the key provisions of the Regulatory Relief Act as it relates to community banks and bank holding companies include: (i) designating mortgages held in portfolio as “qualified mortgages” for banks with less than $10 billion in assets, subject to certain documentation and product limitations; (ii) exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets (and total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5% or less of total assets) from Volcker Rule requirements relating to proprietary trading; (iii) simplifying capital calculations for banks with less than $10 billion in assets by requiring federal banking agencies to establish a community bank leverage ratio of tangible equity to average consolidated assets of not less than 8% or more than 10%, and provide that banks that maintain tangible equity in excess of such ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with risk-based capital and leverage requirements; (iv) assisting smaller banks with obtaining stable funding by providing an exception for reciprocal deposits from 
5

FDIC restrictions on acceptance of brokered deposits; (v) raising the eligibility for use of short-form Call Reports from $1 billion to $5 billion in assets; (vi) clarifying definitions pertaining to high volatility commercial real estate loans (HVCRE), which require higher capital allocations, so that only loans with increased risk are subject to higher risk weightings; and (vii) changing the eligibility for use of the small bank holding company policy statement from institutions with under $1 billion in assets to institutions with under $3 billion in assets. 
Section 201 of the Regulatory Relief Act directed the federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) of not less than 8% and not more than 10% for qualifying community banks and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. Qualifying community banking organizations that exceed the CBLR level established by the agencies, and that elect to be covered by the CBLR framework, will be considered to have met: (i) the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements under the banking agencies’ capital rules; (ii) the capital ratio requirements necessary to be considered “well capitalized” under the banking agencies’ prompt corrective action framework in the case of insured depository institutions; and (iii) any other applicable capital or leverage requirements. 
On February 8, 2019, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, and the FDIC published for comment a proposed rule to implement the provisions of Section 201 of the Regulatory Relief Act. Under the proposal, a qualifying community banking organization would be defined as a depository institution or depository institution holding company with less than $10 billion in assets and specified limited amounts of off-balance sheet exposures, trading assets and liabilities, mortgage servicing assets, and certain temporary difference deferred tax assets. A qualifying community banking organization would be permitted to elect the CBLR framework if its CBLR is greater than 9%. The proposed rulemaking also addresses opting in and opting out of the CBLR framework by a community banking organization, the treatment of a community banking organization that falls below CBLR requirements, and the effect of various CBLR levels for purposes of the prompt corrective action categories applicable to insured depository institutions. Advanced approaches banking organizations (generally, institutions with $250 billion or more in consolidated assets) are not eligible to use the CBLR framework.
The Corporation continues to analyze the changes implemented by the Regulatory Relief Act, including the CBLR framework included in the recently proposed rulemaking. The Corporation has not determined at this time whether or not it would qualify for the CBLR framework or, if so, whether it would elect to utilize the CBLR framework when final rules are adopted. The Corporation does not believe, however, that the changes resulting from the Regulatory Relief Act will materially impact the Corporation’s business, operations, or financial results.
Other Legislation
The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act made significant changes to the bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things: (i) expands the authority of the FRB to examine bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, including insured depository institutions; (ii) requires a bank holding company to be well capitalized and well managed to receive approval of an interstate bank acquisition; (iii) provides mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer’s ability to pay and making more loans subject to provisions for higher-cost loans and new disclosures; (iv) creates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) that has rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws; (v) introduces additional corporate governance and executive compensation requirements on public companies subject to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, such as the Corporation; (vi) permits FDIC-insured banks to pay interest on business demand deposits; (vii) requires that holding companies and other companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution serve as a source of financial strength to that institution; (viii) makes permanent the $250 thousand limit for federal deposit insurance at all insured depository institutions; and (ix) permits national and state banks to establish interstate branches to the same extent as the branch host state allows establishment of in-state branches.
The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets such as the Banks will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.
Under the Bank Secrecy Act, a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect certain types of transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction. Financial institutions are generally required to report cash transactions involving 
6

more than $10,000 to the United States Treasury. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for transactions that involve more than $5,000 and that the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect, involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the law, or has no lawful purpose. 
Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, commonly referred to as the “USA PATRIOT Act,” financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence standards intended to detect, and prevent, the use of the United States financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Patriot Act requires financial institutions, including banks, to establish anti-money laundering programs, including employee training and independent audit requirements, meet minimum specified standards, follow minimum standards for customer identification and maintenance of customer identification records.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted to enhance penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures under the federal securities laws.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally applies to all companies, including the Corporation, that file or are required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act.  The legislation includes provisions, among other things, governing the services that can be provided by a public company’s independent auditors and the procedures for approving such services, requiring the chief executive officer and principal accounting officer to certify certain matters relating to the company’s periodic filings under the Exchange Act, requiring expedited filings of reports by insiders of their securities transactions and containing other provisions relating to insider conflicts of interest, increasing disclosure requirements relating to critical financial accounting policies and their application, increasing penalties for securities law violations, and creating a new public accounting oversight board, a regulatory body subject to SEC jurisdiction with broad powers to set auditing, quality control, and ethics standards for accounting firms.  In response to the legislation, the national securities exchanges and NASDAQ, adopted new rules relating to certain governance matters, including the independence of members of a company’s audit committee as a condition to listing or continued listing.
Congress is often considering financial industry legislation, and the federal banking agencies routinely propose new regulations.  The Corporation cannot predict how any new legislation, or new rules adopted by federal or state banking agencies, may affect the business of the Corporation and its subsidiaries in the future.
Environmental Laws
Environmentally related hazards have become a source of high risk and potential liability for financial institutions relating to their loans. Environmentally contaminated properties owned by an institution’s borrowers may result in a drastic reduction in the value of the collateral securing the institution’s loans to such borrowers, high environmental clean up costs to the borrower affecting its ability to repay the loans, the subordination of any lien in favor of the institution to a state or federal lien securing clean up costs, and liability to the institution for clean up costs if it forecloses on the contaminated property or becomes involved in the management of the borrower. The Corporation is not aware of any borrower who is currently subject to any environmental investigation or clean up proceeding which is likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Corporation.
Effect of Government Monetary Policies
The earnings of the Corporation are and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States Government and its agencies.   The monetary policies of the FRB have had, and will likely continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The FRB has a major effect upon the levels of bank loans, investments, and deposits through its open market operations in the United States Government securities and through its regulation of, among other things, the discount rate on borrowings by member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits.  It is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.
DESCRIPTION OF THE BANKS

History and Business

JSSB was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a state bank in 1934 and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation on July 12, 1983. As of December 31, 2018, JSSB had total assets of $1,251,871,000; total shareholders’ equity of $90,896,000; and total deposits of $862,166,000. JSSB's deposits are insured by the FDIC for the maximum amount provided under current law.

Luzerne was acquired by the Corporation on June 1, 2013. As of December 31, 2018, Luzerne had total assets of $439,086,000; total shareholders’ equity of $49,580,000; and total deposits of $358,753,000. Luzerne's deposits are insured by the FDIC for the maximum amount provided under current law.
The Banks engage in business as commercial banks, doing business at locations in Lycoming, Clinton, Centre, Montour, Union and Luzerne Counties, Pennsylvania.  The Banks offer insurance, securities brokerage services, annuity and mutual fund investment products, and financial planning through the M Group.
Services offered by the Banks include accepting time, demand and savings deposits including Super NOW accounts, statement savings accounts, money market accounts, and fixed rate certificates of deposit.  Their services also include making secured and unsecured business and consumer loans that include financing commercial transactions as well as construction and residential mortgage loans and revolving credit loans with overdraft protection.
The Banks' loan portfolio mix can be classified into three principal categories: commercial and agricultural, real estate, and consumer.  Real estate loans can be further segmented into residential, commercial, and construction.  Qualified borrowers are defined by our loan policy and our underwriting standards. Owner provided equity requirements range from 0% to 35%, depending on the collateral offered for the loan.  Terms are generally restricted to 30 years or less with the exception of construction and land development, which are generally limited to one and five years, respectively.  Real estate appraisals, property construction verifications, and site visitations comply with our loan policy and with industry regulatory standards.

Prospective residential mortgage customer’s repayment ability is determined from information contained in the application and recent income tax returns, or other verified income sources.  Emphasis is on credit, employment, income, and residency verification.  Broad hazard insurance is always required and flood insurance where applicable.  In the case of construction mortgages, builders risk insurance is requested.

Agricultural loans for the purchase or improvement of real estate must meet the Banks' real estate underwriting criteria.  Agricultural loans made for the purchase of equipment are usually payable in five years, but never more than ten, depending upon the useful life of the purchased asset. Minimum borrower equity ranges from 0% to 35% depending on the purpose.  Livestock financing criteria depends upon the nature of the operation. Agricultural loans are also made for crop production purposes.  Such loans are structured to repay within the production cycle and not carried over into a subsequent year.

Commercial loans are made for the acquisition and improvement of real estate, purchase of equipment, and for working capital purposes on a seasonal or revolving basis.  General purpose working capital loans are also available with repayment expected within one year.  Equipment loans are generally amortized over three to ten years. Insurance coverage with the Banks as loss payee is required, especially in the case where the equipment is rolling stock.  It is also a general policy to collateralize non-real estate loans with the asset purchased and, depending upon loan terms, junior liens are filed on other available assets.  Financial information required on all commercial mortgages includes the most current three years balance sheets and income statements and projections on income to be developed through the project. In the case of corporations and partnerships, the principals are often asked to personally guaranty the entity’s debt.

Seasonal and revolving lines of credit are offered for working capital purposes.  Collateral for such a loan may vary but often includes the pledge of inventory and/or receivables.  Drawing availability is usually 50% of inventory and 80% of eligible receivables.  Eligible receivables are defined as invoices less than 90 days delinquent.  Exclusive reliance is very seldom placed on such collateral; therefore, other lienable assets are also taken into the collateral pool.  Where reliance is placed on inventory and accounts receivable, the applicant must provide financial information including agings on a specified basis.  In addition, the guaranty of the principals is usually obtained.

Letter of credit availability is usually limited to standby or performance letters of credit where the customer is well known to the Banks.  The credit criteria is the same as that utilized in making a direct loan. Collateral is obtained in most cases.

Consumer loan products include residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines, automobile financing, personal loans and lines of credit, overdraft and check lines.  Our policy includes standards used in the industry on debt service ratios and terms are consistent with prudent underwriting standards and the use of proceeds. Verifications are made of employment and residency, along with credit history.

Second mortgages are confined to equity borrowing and home improvements.  Terms are generally fifteen years or less.  Loan to collateral value criteria is 90% or less and verifications are made to determine values.   Automobile financing is generally restricted to five years and done on both an indirect and direct basis.  The Banks, as a practice, do not floor plan and therefore do not discount 
8

dealer paper.  Small loan requests are to accommodate personal needs such as debt consolidation or the purchase of small appliances.  Overdraft check lines are usually limited to $5,000 or less.
The Banks' investment portfolios are analyzed and priced on a monthly basis. Investments are made in U.S. Treasuries, U.S. Agency issues, bank qualified tax-exempt municipal bonds, taxable municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and corporate stocks which consist of Pennsylvania bank stocks.  Bonds with BBB or better ratings are used, unless a local issue is purchased that has a lesser or no rating.  Factors taken into consideration when investments are purchased include liquidity, the Corporation’s tax position, tax equivalent yield, third party investment ratings, and the policies of the Asset/Liability Committee.
The banking environment in Lycoming, Clinton, Centre, Montour, Union and Luzerne Counties, Pennsylvania is highly competitive.  The Banks operate twenty-six full service offices in these markets and compete for loans and deposits with numerous commercial banks, savings and loan associations, and other financial institutions. The economic base of the region is developed around small business, health care, educational facilities (college and public schools), light manufacturing industries, and agriculture.
The Banks have a relatively stable deposit base and no material amount of deposits is obtained from a single depositor or group of depositors, excluding public entities that account for approximately 11% of total deposits.  Although the Banks have regular opportunities to bid on pools of funds of $100,000 or more in the hands of municipalities, hospitals, and others, it does not rely on these monies to fund loans or intermediate or longer-term investments.
The Banks have not experienced any significant seasonal fluctuations in the amount of deposits. The Banks have experienced an outflow of deposits related to municipalities and school districts due to the ongoing Commonwealth of Pennsylvania budget impasse.

Supervision and Regulation

As referenced elsewhere, the banking business is highly regulated, and the Banks are only able to engage in business activities, and to provide products and services, that are permitted by applicable law and regulation.  In addition, the earnings of the Banks are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities including the FDIC and the FRB. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the money supply and interest rates.  Among the instruments used to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. Government Securities, changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits, and limitations on interest rates that member banks may pay on time and savings deposits.  These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, and their use may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits.
The policies and regulations of the FRB have had and will probably continue to have a significant effect on the Banks' deposits, loans and investment growth, as well as the rate of interest earned and paid, and are expected to affect the Banks' operation in the future. The effect of such policies and regulations upon the future business and earnings of the Banks cannot accurately be predicted.
