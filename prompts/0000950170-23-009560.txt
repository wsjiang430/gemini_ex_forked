 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 Aptose Biosciences Inc. (“Aptose,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a science-driven clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to precision medicines addressing the unmet clinical needs in oncology, with an initial focus on hematology. The Company's small molecule cancer therapeutics pipeline includes products designed to provide single agent efficacy and to enhance the efficacy of other anti-cancer therapies and regimens without overlapping toxicities. The Company’s executive offices are located in San Diego, California, and our head office is located in Toronto, Canada.
 Aptose Programs
 Aptose is advancing oral targeted agents to treat life-threatening cancers that, in most cases, are not elective for patients and require immediate treatment. We have two clinical-stage investigational products under active development for the treatment of hematologic malignancies: tuspetinib (HM43239), an oral, potent myeloid kinase inhibitor, and luxeptinib (CG-806), an oral, dual lymphoid and myeloid kinase inhibitor. Tuspetinib and luxeptinib are being evaluated for safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and signals of efficacy in Phase 1 clinical trials, while a third clinical asset not under active development is available for partnering (APTO-253). Each molecule is described below.
 Tuspetinib is a once-daily oral potent myeloid kinase inhibitor, targeting a select group of kinases operative in myeloid malignancies and known to be involved in tumor proliferation, resistance to therapy, and differentiation but avoiding kinases that typically cause toxicities associated with other kinase inhibitors. Tuspetinib has completed the dose escalation and dose exploration stages of an international Phase 1/2 clinical trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic responses, and efficacy as a single agent in patients with relapsed or refractory ("R/R") acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”). Complete responses (“CRs”) without dose limiting toxicities were achieved at four dose levels across a broad diversity of mutationally-defined AML populations and with a favorable safety profile. Moreover, tuspetinib to date has caused no QTc prolongations, liver or kidney toxicities, muscle damage or differentiation syndrome in treated patients and has caused no myelosuppression with continuous dosing of patients in remission. These findings led to the advancement of tuspetinib into the APTIVATE expansion trial of the Phase 1/2 program to collect responses in R/R AML patient populations enriched with specific genotypic backgrounds when treated with single agent tuspetinib or when combined with the venetoclax BCL-2 inhibitor, with the intent to guide selection of mutationally-defined AML populations for single agent Phase 2 Accelerated Approval Trial(s) and to position tuspetinib for dual and triple combination studies in later and early lines of therapy. Based on the safety and efficacy profile of tuspetinib, we believe that tuspetinib, if approved, can reach annual sales greater

than $1 billion by 2035 because we believe tuspetinib could 1) become the preferred kinase inhibitor for inclusion in triplet combination for front line AML patients with FLT3 mutations and for patients with wild type FLT3, 2) become the preferred kinase inhibitor for inclusion in doublet combination with venetoclax for second line AML patients, 3) serve as an effective agent for maintenance therapy to prevent relapse in patients who achieved a complete remission through a stem cell transplant or through drug-based therapy, and 4) serve as an effective agent for the treatment of third line FLT3 mutated patients failed by prior therapy with other FLT3 inhibitors. However, our belief is based on management’s current assumptions and estimates, which are subject to change, and there can be no assurance that tuspetinib will ever be approved or successfully commercialized and, if approved and commercialized, that it will ever generate significant revenues. See our “Risk Factors – “We are an early stage development company with no revenues from product sales.” and “We have a history of operating losses. We expect to incur net losses and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Luxeptinib is a novel, oral, highly potent lymphoid and myeloid kinase inhibitor that selectively targets defined clusters of kinases operative in myeloid and lymphoid hematologic malignancies. This small molecule anticancer agent has been evaluated in a Phase 1a/b study for the treatment of patients having B-cell leukemias and lymphomas that are resistant/refractory/intolerant to other therapies. Under a separate Investigational New Drug, Luxeptinib has been evaluated in a Phase 1a/b study for the treatment of patients with R/R AML or high risk MDS. These studies with the original formulation demonstrated tumor shrinkage among B-cell cancer patients, including a very recent report of a CR in a DLBCL patient that was determined via biopsy analysis at the end of Cycle 22 with 900mg BID dosing of the original G1 formulation. Likewise, a CR in one R/R AML patient occurred with 450mg BID dosing of the original G1 formulation. While these were important, absorption of the original G1 formulation hampered effectiveness of luxeptinib. To address the limited absorption of the G1 formulation, a new G3 formulation was developed and demonstrated improved absorption properties. The new G3 formulation is now being tested under conditions of twice daily continuous oral dosing in R/R AML patients. It is hoped the G3 formulation of luxeptinib can serve patients across lymphoid and myeloid malignancies and combine well with other agents to extend its application to multiple lines of therapy.
 APTO-253 is a small molecule MYC oncogene inhibitor at the Phase 1a/b clinical trial stage of development for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory blood cancers, including AML and high-risk MDS. The clinical program was discontinued effective December 20, 2021, following a prioritization of the Company’s other more advanced pipeline assets.


The following table sets the product candidates in our pipeline and their respective stages of development.


Tuspetinib Program
 Inlicensing Overview
 On November 4, 2021, we entered a licensing agreement with the South Korean company Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co Ltd. (“Hanmi”) for the clinical and commercial development of tuspetinib (formerly HM43239). Under the terms of the agreement, Hanmi granted Aptose exclusive worldwide rights to tuspetinib for all indications. Hanmi received an upfront payment of $12.5 million, including $5 million in cash and $7.5 million in Common Shares. Hanmi will also receive up to $407.5 million in future milestone payments contingent upon achieving certain clinical, regulatory and sales milestones across several potential indications, as well as tiered royalties on net sales. The term of the agreement will continue on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the royalty period for such product in such country. The licenses to Aptose will survive and become non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable and fully paid-up on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, upon their natural expiration under the terms of the agreement.
Preclinical Profile
 Tuspetinib is an oral, once-daily, highly potent myeloid kinome inhibitor designed to target key kinases operative in myeloid malignancies. In preclinical studies, tuspetinib demonstrated potent in vitro and in vivo activity against FLT3 ITD mutated as well as resistance-conferring D835 and gatekeeper (F691) tyrosine kinase domain ("TKD") mutated AML. Additionally, tuspetinib inhibited phosphorylation of SYK, known to be highly activated in AML and associated with resistance to FLT3 targeted therapy. Tuspetinib also demonstrated inhibitory activity against several kinases involved in tumor cell proliferation and/or differentiation, including mutant forms of c-KIT, JAK1, JAK2, and RSK, with IC50 values < 10 nM.
 Tuspetinib induced in vitro cytotoxicity in AML and Ba/F3 cell lines expressing FLT3 WT, ITD, and/or TKD point mutations. Tuspetinib showed greater inhibitory activity compared to quizartinib on Ba/F3 cells expressing resistance-conferring ITD/TKD double mutations (ITD/F691L and ITD/D835Y). Thus, Tuspetinib may overcome clinically relevant ITD/TKD double mutations, which may result from sustained FLT3 inhibition. Moreover, target modulation was shown as tuspetinib inhibited FLT3 phosphorylation and downstream signaling molecules such as phospho-ERK and phospho-STAT5.

The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of tuspetinib was demonstrated in murine xenograft models using MV-4-11 and MOLM-13 human AML cells having the ITD mutant form of FLT3 and using the MOLM-14 model having the ITD and F691L dual mutations of FLT3 with dosing regimens that match those currently under investigation. Tuspetinib exhibited dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition of models of FLT3 ITD mutant AML with complete tumor regression observed in some groups, and no change in body weight. Of note, tuspetinib produced greater tumor growth inhibition in the MOLM-14 FLT3-ITD/F691L model compared to gilteritinib, or entospletinib (SYK inhibitor) as single agents, and comparable activity to the gilteritinib plus entospletinib combination.
Latest Clinical Update and Program Status
 Tuspetinib has completed the dose escalation and dose exploration phases of an international Phase 1/2 study in patients with relapsed or refractory AML across clinical centers in the United States and South Korea. Clinical data from tuspetinib in AML were presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2022 and presented during a Corporate Comprehensive Clinical Update Call held December 11, 2022. Data presented demonstrated that tuspetinib delivers single agent responses without prolonged myelosuppression or life-threatening toxicities in these very ill and heavily pretreated relapsed or refractory AML patients. Responses were observed in a broad range of mutationally-defined populations, including those with mutated forms of NPM1, MLL, TP53, NRAS, KRAS, DNMT3A, RUNX1, wild-type FLT3, ITD or TKD mutated FLT3, various splicing factors, and other genes As of October 6, 2022, 60 heavily pretreated R/R AML patients were enrolled at multiple centers and treated at doses escalating from 20 mg to 200 mg, with further dose exploration at the 40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg and 160 mg dose levels. Tuspetinib delivered multiple CRs at 40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg and 160 mg dose levels in which no dose limiting toxicities ("DLT") were observed. Tuspetinib demonstrated clinically meaningful benefit in all responders, by either bridging successfully to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or leading to a durable response, as well as a favorable safety profile. In addition to 5 CRc and 1 PR reported at ASH 2021, 4 new CRc and 3 new PR had been generated during 2022. New responses during 2022 were achieved with 160 mg, 120 mg, 80 mg, and 40 mg. Among efficacy evaluable patients treated with 80 mg, 120 mg, or 160mg, response rates ranging from 19% to 75% were achieved in specific genotypic subpopulations of R/R AML patients. Significant bone marrow leukemic blast reductions were observed broadly in FLT3+ and FLT3 wildtype patients across multiple dose levels, comparable to reported gilteritinib data, except that the patients treated with tuspetinib were more heavily pre-treated relapsed and refractory AML patients than those treated with gilteritinib. Vignettes of patient experiences highlight the potency and breadth of tuspetinib to deliver complete remissions among several mutationally-defined populations with a diversity of adverse mutations. Tuspetinib continued to show a favorable safety profile with only mild AEs and no DLTs up to 160 mg per day, and no drug discontinuations from drug related toxicity. No drug related SAE, drug related deaths, differentiation syndrome, AE of QT prolongation or DLT were observed through the 160 mg level. Tuspetinib avoids many of the typical toxicities observed with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Aptose identified a safe therapeutic range with a broad therapeutic window, spanning the dose levels of 40, 80, 120 and 160 milligrams. Aptose also announced that enrollment had been initiate in the APTIVATE expansion trial for monotherapy and drug combination therapy with tuspetinib. For the APTIVATE expansion trial, Aptose selected 120 mg as the initiating single agent expansion dose and 80 mg as the initiating dose selected for combination with venetoclax.
As of January 30, 2023, Aptose announced the dosing of patients in the APTIVATE Phase 1/2 clinical trial of tuspetinib, and that another clinical response has been achieved by a R/R AML patient receiving 40 mg tuspetinib once daily orally in the original dose exploration trial, the second response at the recently launched low-dose 40 mg cohort. In addition, Aptose elucidated a rationale for the superior safety profile of tuspetinib. While several kinase inhibitors require high exposures that exert near complete suppression of a single target to elicit responses, those agents often cause additional toxicity because they also cause extensive inhibition of that target in normal cells. In contrast, tuspetinib simultaneously suppresses a small suite of kinase-driven pathways critical for leukemogenesis. Consequently, tuspetinib achieves clinical responses at lower exposures with less overall suppression of each pathway, thereby avoiding many toxicities observed with competing agents.
Luxeptinib Program
 Inlicensing Overview
 On May 7, 2018, we exercised an option by paying $2.0 million in cash to the South Korean company Crystal Genomics, Inc. (“CG”) to purchase an exclusive license to research, develop and commercialize luxeptinib in all countries of the world except the Republic of Korea and China, for all fields of use (collectively, the “Rights”). Subsequently, on June 14, 2018, we announced that we entered into a license agreement with CG for Aptose to gain a license for rights to CG-806 in China (including the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, and Macau) ) (the “China Rights”). Under the license agreement, Aptose made an upfront payment to CG of $3.0 million for the China rights. CG is eligible for development, regulatory and commercial-based milestones, as well as single-digit royalties on product sales in China. The total deal value for the China Rights, including the upfront payment, is up to $125 million. Aptose now owns worldwide (excluding Korea) rights to luxeptinib, a first-in-class, highly potent oral small molecule being developed for AML, B-cell malignancies, and other hematologic malignancies. Future possible royalties that might be paid under these agreements are determined on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, on net sales during the period of time beginning on the first commercial sale of such product in such country and continuing until the later of: (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the CG Patents in such country covering such product; and (ii) ten (10) years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
Preclinical Profile
 Luxeptinib exhibits a picomolar half maximal inhibitory concentration (“IC50”) toward FLT3 with the Internal Tandem Duplication (“FLT3-ITD”), potency against the wild type FLT3 and a host of mutant forms of FLT3, as well as single-digit nanomolar IC50’s against BTK and its C481S mutant (“BTK-C481S”). Further, luxeptinib suppresses a small group of other relevant oncogenic kinases/pathways (including CSF1R, PDGFRα, TRK, and the ERK, MYC, AKT/mTOR/S6K and AURK/H3S10 pathways) that are operative in AML and certain B cell malignancies, but does not inhibit the TEC, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2/4 kinases that are responsible for safety concerns with certain other kinase inhibitors.
As a potent inhibitor of FLT3-ITD, luxeptinib may become an effective therapy in a high-risk subset of AML patients. This is because the FLT3-ITD mutation occurs in approximately 30% of patients with AML and is associated with a poor prognosis. In murine xenograft studies of human AML (FLT3-ITD), CG-806 administered orally resulted in tumor elimination (“cures”) without measurable toxicity. Importantly, luxeptinib targets other oncogenic kinases which may also be operative in FLT3-ITD AML, thereby potentially allowing the agent to become an important therapeutic option for a broader group of this difficult-to-treat AML patient population. The findings that luxeptinib targets all forms of FLT3 and several other key oncogenic pathways, and that luxeptinib was well tolerated from a safety perspective during efficacy and formal Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) toxicology studies, suggest that luxeptinib may also have applicability in treating patients, particularly those over the age of 65, who cannot tolerate other therapies.


Separate from the AML and FLT3 story, luxeptinib may be a therapeutic option for patients with B cell malignancies. Overexpression of the BTK enzyme can drive oncogenic signaling of certain B cell malignancies, including CLL and certain NHL such as mantle cell lymphoma (“MCL”), follicular lymphoma (“FL”), diffuse large cell B cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) and others. Therapy of these patients with covalent, irreversible BTK inhibitors, such as ibrutinib, that target the active site cysteine (“Cys”) residue of BTK can be beneficial in many patients. However, therapy with covalent BTK inhibitors can select for BTK with a C481S mutation, thereby conferring resistance to covalent BTK inhibitors. Furthermore, approximately half of CLL patients have discontinued treatment with ibrutinib after 3.4 years of therapy. Discontinuation of ibrutinib is due to the development of drug resistance (in particular, patients have malignancies that developed the BTK-C481S mutation), or due to refractory disease (patient tumors did not respond to ibrutinib) or intolerance (side effects led to discontinuation of ibrutinib), according to a study performed at The Ohio State University. The C481S mutation is observed in 5-10% of the patients, while 40-45% of the patients were intolerant or refractory to ibrutinib. As a non-covalent, reversible inhibitor of BTK, luxeptinib does not rely on the Cysteine 481 residue (“C481”) for inhibition of the BTK enzyme. Indeed, recent X-ray crystallographic studies (with wild type and C481S BTK) demonstrated that luxeptinib binds productively to the BTK active site in a manner that is indifferent to the presence or absence of mutations at the 481 residue. Moreover, in vitro studies demonstrated that luxeptinib kills B cell malignancy cell lines on average approximately 1000 times more potently than ibrutinib and kills ibrutinib-resistance cancer cells, and that luxeptinib more potently killed primary malignant cells taken from the bone marrow of CLL and ALL B-cell cancer patients. Yet, luxeptinib demonstrated a high degree of safety in animal efficacy and GLP toxicology studies. Consequently, patients who are resistant, refractory or intolerant to ibrutinib or other commercially approved or development-stage BTK inhibitors with B cell malignancies may continue to be sensitive to luxeptinib therapy. This is particularly true since luxeptinib inhibits the wild type and mutant forms of BTK, as well as other kinases/pathways that drive the survival and proliferation of B cell malignancies.
 Latest Clinical Update and Program Status
 Luxeptinib is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 a/b trial in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies who have failed or are intolerant to standard therapies, and in a separate Phase 1 a/b trial in patients with relapsed or refractory AML or high-risk MDS. During 2022, a new G3 formulation was tested as a single dose in 20 patients during the ongoing Phase 1 a/b clinical program. Modeling of the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of G3 predicted steady-state plasma exposure from continuous dosing with 50 mg of G3 (every 12 hours, Q12h) should be comparable to that of 900 mg of the original G1 formulation Q12h, representing a significant improvement in bioavailability with G3. On November 14, 2022, Aptose announced dosing of the first AML patient to receive a continuous dosing regimen of the G3 formulation (50 mg G3 Q12h), with the protocol allowing for further dose escalation of G3 in subsequent patients. Clinical data from both studies were presented during a Corporate Comprehensive Clinical Update Call held December 11, 2022. During the Corporate Update Call, Aptose announced a CR was achieved with a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patient at the end of Cycle 22 with 900mg BID of the original G1 formulation. Previously, an MRD-negative CR was reported with a R/R AML patient receiving 450mg BID of the original G1 formulation. Aptose expects that dosing 9-15 patients will determine if G3 is safe and achieves desired exposures to deliver clinical responses.
APTO-253 Program
 APTO-253 is a novel small molecule therapeutic agent that inhibits expression of the MYC oncogene, leading to cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death (apoptosis) in human-derived solid tumor and hematologic cancer cells, without causing general myelosuppression of the healthy bone marrow. MYC is a transcription factor that regulates cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and overexpression amplifies new sets of genes to promote oncogenesis.
The clinical development of APTO-253 began in January 2011, with a Phase 1 dose-escalation study in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The clinical program of APTO-253 more recently also included a Phase 1a/b dose escalation study in patients with relapsed or refractory AML or high risk MDS, during which no objective responses were observed.

On December 20, 2021, Aptose announced the decision to discontinue further clinical development of APTO-253. The decision resulted from a strategic prioritization of the company’s resources to focus on more advanced pipeline candidates, as well as an internal review of the product profile and performance to date of APTO-253, including a clinical hold placed by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”).
 Competitive Conditions
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. There are numerous companies in these industries that are focusing their efforts on activities similar to ours. Some of these are companies with established positions in the pharmaceutical industry and may have substantially more financial and technical resources, more extensive research and development capabilities, and greater marketing, distribution, production, and human resources than Aptose. In addition, we face competition from other companies for opportunities to enter partnerships with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions.
 Competition with our potential products may include chemotherapeutic agents, monoclonal antibodies, antisense therapies, small molecules, immunotherapies, vaccines, and other biologics with novel mechanisms of action. These drugs may kill cancer cells indiscriminately, or through a targeted approach, and some have the potential to be used in non-cancer indications. We also expect that we will experience competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that have other forms of treatment for the cancers that we target, including drugs currently in development for the treatment of cancer that employ a number of novel approaches for attacking these cancer targets. Cancer is a complex disease with more than 100 indications requiring drugs for treatment. The drugs in competition with our potential drugs have specific targets for attacking the disease, targets which are not necessarily the same as ours. These competitive drugs, however, could potentially also be used together in combination therapies with our drugs to manage the disease. Other factors that could render our potential products less competitive may include the stage of development, where competitors’ products may achieve earlier commercialization, as well as superior patent protection, better safety profiles, or a preferred cost-benefit profile.
 Tuspetinib and Luxeptinib for AML
 We also face intense competition in AML as there is a wide range of therapies that have been approved and are under development for the treatment of AML. Companies that have developed approved therapies include Jazz (VYXEOS), Pfizer (MYLOTARG), Novartis (RYDAPT), Astellas (XOSPATA), Servier (TIBSOVO), Rigel (REZLIDHA), and AbbVie (VENCLEXTA), among others. Others are currently developing targeted therapies such as FLT3 inhibitors which include Daiichi Sankyo (quizartinib), Arog (crenolanib), IDH1/2 inhibitors which include Celgene/BMS (IDHIFA), SYK inhibitors which include Kronos Bio (lanraplenib), IRAK4 inhibitors which include Curis (emavusertib), and menin inhibitors which include Syndax (revumenib, SNDX-5613) and Kura (KO-539), among others.
Luxeptinib for B Cell Malignancies
 We are aware of a number of companies that have developed and are pursuing different approaches to BTK inhibition, both for the wild type and to the C481S-mutant forms. Companies that have developed approved or are currently developing inhibitors that directly target the wild type include AbbVie (IMBRUVICA), AstraZeneca (CALQUENCE), and Beigene Co., Ltd. (Zanubrutinib). Others that are developing inhibitors that target the C481S-mutant BTK include Merck (nemtabrutinib), and Eli Lilly (pirtobrutinib), among others.
Manufacturers, Suppliers and Other Third-Party Contractors
 Contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) manufacture our product candidates for all preclinical studies and clinical trials. We rely on CMOs for manufacturing, filling, packaging, storing and shipping of drug product in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations applicable to our products. The FDA ensures the quality of drug products by carefully monitoring drug manufacturers’ compliance with cGMP regulations. The cGMP regulations for drugs contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of a drug product. These CMOs are reputable companies active in the biotechnology industry. Pricing is predictable as there are many alternatives for such supplies that are readily available.
 We rely and will continue to rely on third party contract research organizations (“CROs”) to conduct a significant portion of our preclinical and clinical development activities. Preclinical activities include in vivo studies providing access to specific disease models, pharmacology and toxicology studies, and assay development. Clinical development activities include trial design, regulatory submissions, clinical patient recruitment, clinical trial monitoring, clinical data management and analysis, safety monitoring and project management, contract manufacturing and quality assurance.
 Intellectual Property
We believe that our issued patents and pending applications are important in establishing and maintaining a competitive position with respect to our products and technology.
 Tuspetinib (HM43239)
 In November 2021, we licensed the exclusive rights to research, develop and commercialize tuspetinib. Under the terms of the agreement, Hanmi has granted Aptose exclusive worldwide rights to tuspetinib for all indications.  Aptose is now the exclusive licensee of composition of matter and use patents covering tuspetinib, and tuspetinib analogs. Aptose believes that it now owns rights to a strong and defensive intellectual property position.
As of December 31, 2022, Aptose owns rights in 39 issued patents, including 3 issued U.S. patents, and 22 patents validated in countries in Europe, that are in force and cover the tuspetinib compound, or analog compounds. These patents are expected to provide protection until 2038-2039. Patent applications are also pending in the United States and in contracting states to the Patent Cooperation Treaty for coverage of tuspetinib and analog compounds, with expected expiry dates between 2038‑2042.
Luxeptinib (CG-806)
 In May 2018 and June 2018, we licensed the Rights to CG-806, for all fields of use, in all territories outside of the Republic of Korea and China, by exercising an option we obtained through a June 2016 option-license agreement with CG that had granted us an exclusive option to research, develop and commercialize CG-806. In June 2018, we entered into a separate license agreement with CG for Aptose to gain a license for the China Rights. Aptose now owns worldwide Rights to CG-806, including an issued patent in China but excluding any Rights in Korea.


As of December 31, 2022, Aptose owns rights to 46 issued patents, including 3 issued U.S. patents, and 30 patents validated n countries in Europe, that are in force and cover numerous compounds, including the CG-806 compound, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the CG-806 compound, and methods of use for treating various diseases by administering various compounds, including the CG-806 compound. These patents are expected to provide protection until 2033-2038. Patent applications are also pending in the United States and in contracting states to the Patent Cooperation Treaty for coverage of CG-806, with expected expiry dates between 2038‑2039.
 Environmental Protection
 The Company’s research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and, accordingly, the Company is subject to federal, provincial and local laws and regulations in the United States and Canada governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products. To the knowledge of the Company, compliance with such environmental laws and regulations does not and will not have any significant impact on its capital spending, profits or competitive position within the normal course of its operating activities. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future or that its operations, business or assets will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed 35 full-time persons and one part-time person in research and drug development and administration activities. Eleven of our employees hold Ph.D.s, two hold M.D.s, and numerous others hold degrees and designations such as M.Sc., B.Sc., C.P.A., C.M.A., M.Acc. and M.B.A. To encourage a focus on achieving long-term performance, employees and members of the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) have the ability to acquire an ownership interest in the Company through Aptose’s share option and alternate compensation plans.
The business of the Company requires personnel with specialized skills and knowledge in oncology. Researchers must be able to design and implement studies to assess the efficacy of anticancer drugs. Specialized knowledge and skills relating to chemistry and formulation process development are also needed. Such knowledge and skills are needed to develop product specific analytical methods and formulation processes. The Company’s business also requires clinical and regulatory expertise and knowledge. The Company has trained scientists and personnel with broad experience in these fields.
 None of our employees are unionized, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 Government Regulation
 Overview
 Our overall regulatory strategy is to work with the appropriate government departments which regulate the use and sale of therapeutic drug products. This includes the FDA in the United States, Health Canada in Canada, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) in Europe, and other local regulatory agencies with oversight of preclinical studies, clinical trials and marketing of therapeutic products. Where possible, we intend to take advantage of opportunities for accelerated development of drugs designed to treat rare and serious or life-threatening diseases. We also intend to pursue priority evaluation of any application for marketing approval filed in Canada, the United States or the European Union and to file additional drug applications in other markets where commercial opportunities exist. We may not be able to pursue these opportunities successfully.
 Regulation(s) by government authorities in the United States, Canada, and the European Union are significant factors in guiding our current research and drug development activities. To clinically test, manufacture and market drug products for therapeutic use, we must be in compliance with guidance and regulations established by the regulatory agencies in the countries in which we currently operate or intend to operate.


The laws of most of these countries require the licensing of manufacturing facilities, carefully controlled research and the extensive testing of products. Biotechnology companies must establish the safety and efficacy of their new products in clinical trials; they must establish and comply with cGMPs for the manufacturing of the product and control over marketing activities before being allowed to market a product. The safety and efficacy of a new drug must be shown through human clinical trials of the drug carried out in accordance with the guidance and regulations established by local and federal regulatory agencies.
 The process of completing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval for a new drug takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Once a new drug or product license application is submitted, regulatory agencies may not review the application in a timely manner and may not approve the product. Even after a New Drug Application (“NDA”) submission has occurred and/or approval has been obtained, further studies, including post-marketing studies, may be required to provide additional data on the efficacy and safety necessary to confirm the approved indication or to gain approval for the use of the new drug as a treatment for clinical indications other than those for which the new drug was initially tested. Also, regulatory agencies require post-marketing surveillance programs to monitor a new drug’s side effects, safety and long-term effects of the product. A serious safety or effectiveness problem involving an approved new drug may result in a regulatory agency mandating a withdrawal of the new drug from the market and possible civil action. It is possible that we could encounter such difficulties or excessive costs in our efforts to secure necessary approvals, which could delay or prevent us from manufacturing or marketing our products.
 In addition to the regulatory product approval framework, biotechnology companies, including Aptose, are subject to regulation under local, provincial, state and federal law, including requirements regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, environmental protection and hazardous substance control, and may be subject to other present and future local, provincial, state, federal and foreign regulation, including possible future regulation of the biotechnology industry.
 Approval of New Drugs in Canada
 In Canada, the manufacture and sale of new drugs are controlled by Health Canada. New drugs must pass through a number of testing stages, including pre-clinical testing and human clinical trials. Pre-clinical testing involves testing the new drug’s chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology in vitro and in vivo. Successful results (that is, potentially valuable pharmacological activity combined with an acceptable low level of toxicity) enable the developer of the new drug to file a clinical trial application to begin clinical trials involving humans.
 To study a drug in Canadian patients, a clinical trial application submission must be filed with Health Canada. The clinical trial application submission must contain specified information, including the results of the pre-clinical tests completed at the time of the submission and any available information regarding use of the drug in humans. In addition, since the method of manufacture may affect the efficacy and safety of a new drug, information on manufacturing methods and standards and the stability of the drug substance and dosage form must be presented. Production methods and quality control procedures must be in place to ensure an acceptably pure product, essentially free of contamination, and to ensure uniformity with respect to all quality aspects.
 In addition, all federally regulated trials must be approved and monitored by an independent committee of doctors, scientists, advocates and others to ensure safety and ethical standards, Institutional Review Boards (“IRBs”) or Ethics Review Boards (“ERBs”). The review boards study and approve all study-related documents before a clinical trial begins and also carefully monitor data to detect benefit or harm, and validity of results.


Provided Health Canada does not reject a clinical trial application submission and IRB or ERB approval has been obtained, clinical trials can begin. Clinical trials for product candidates in Canada, as in the United States, are generally carried out in three phases. Phase 1 involves studies to evaluate toxicity and ideal dose levels in healthy humans. The new drug is administered to human patients who have met the clinical trial entry criteria to determine pharmacokinetics, human tolerance and prevalence of any adverse side effects. Phases 2 and 3 involve therapeutic studies. In Phase 2, efficacy, dosage, side effects and safety are established in a small number of patients who have the disease or disorder that the new drug is intended to treat. In Phase 3, there are controlled clinical trials in which the new drug is administered to a large number of patients who are likely to receive benefit from the new drug. In Phase 3, the effectiveness of the new drug in patients is compared to that of standard accepted methods of treatment in order to provide sufficient data for the statistical proof of safety and efficacy for the new drug.
 If clinical studies establish that a new drug has value, the manufacturer submits a new drug submission application to Health Canada for marketing approval. The new drug submission contains all known information known about the new drug, including the results of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials. Information about a substance contained in new drug submission includes its proper name, its chemical name, and details on its method of manufacturing and purification, and its biological, pharmacological and toxicological properties. The new drug submission also provides information about the dosage form of the new drug, including a quantitative listing of all ingredients used in its formulation, its method of manufacture, manufacturing facility information, packaging and labeling, the results of stability tests, and its diagnostic or therapeutic claims and side effects, as well as details of the clinical trials to support the safety and efficacy of the new drug. Furthermore, for biological products, an on-site evaluation is completed to assess the production process and manufacturing facility. It is required prior to the issuance of a notice of compliance. All aspects of the new drug submission are critically reviewed by Health Canada. If a new drug submission is found satisfactory, a notice of compliance is issued permitting the new drug to be sold for the approved use. In Canada, an establishment license must be obtained prior to marketing the product.
 Health Canada has a policy of priority evaluation of new drug submissions for all drugs intended for serious or life-threatening diseases for which no drug product has received regulatory approval in Canada and for which there is reasonable scientific evidence to indicate that the proposed new drug is safe and may provide effective treatment.
 An exception to the foregoing requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of a new drug is the limited authorization that may be available in respect of the sale of new drugs for emergency treatment. Under the special access program, Health Canada may authorize the sale of a quantity of a new drug for human use to a specific practitioner for the emergency treatment of a patient under the practitioner’s care. Prior to authorization, the practitioner must supply Health Canada with information concerning the medical emergency for which the new drug is required, such data as is in the possession of the practitioner with respect to the use, safety and efficacy of the new drug, the names of the institutions at which the new drug is to be used and such other information as may be requested by Health Canada. In addition, the practitioner must agree to report to both the drug manufacturer and Health Canada the results of the new drug’s use in the medical emergency, including information concerning adverse reactions, and must account to Health Canada for all quantities of the new drug made available.
 The Canadian regulatory approval requirements for new drugs outlined above are similar to those of other major pharmaceutical markets. While the testing carried out in Canada is often acceptable for the purposes of regulatory submissions in other countries, individual regulatory authorities may request supplementary testing during their assessment of any submission. Therefore, the clinical testing conducted under Health Canada authorization or the approval of regulatory authorities of other countries may not be accepted by regulatory authorities outside Canada or other countries.


Approval of New Drugs in the United States
In the United States, the FDA controls and investigates the investigation, manufacturing, and sale of new drugs. New drugs require FDA approval of an NDA prior to commercial sale. In the case of certain biological products, a Biological License Application (“BLA”) must be obtained prior to marketing and batch releasing. As in Canada, to obtain marketing approval, data from adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials, demonstrating to the FDA’s satisfaction a new drug’s safety and effectiveness for its intended use, are required. Data are generated in studies conducted pursuant to an investigational new drug (“IND”) submission, similar to that required for a clinical trial application in Canada. Clinical trials with human subjects are characterized as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials or a combination thereof. In a marketing application, the manufacturer must also demonstrate the identity, potency, quality and purity of the active ingredients of the new drug involved, and the stability of those ingredients. Further, the manufacturing facilities, equipment, processes and quality controls for the new drug must comply with the FDA’s current cGMP regulations for drugs both in a pre-licensing inspection before product licensing and in subsequent periodic inspections after licensing. An establishment license grants the sponsor permission to fabricate, package, label, distribute, import, wholesale or test the newly approved drug.
 Federally regulated trials must be approved and monitored by an independent committee of doctors, scientists, advocates, and others to ensure safety and ethical standards, IRBs or ERBs. The review boards study and approve all study-related documents before a clinical trial begins and also carefully monitor data to detect benefit or harm, and validity of results.
 Post-Approval Regulation
 The monitoring of a new drug does not cease once it is on the market. For example, a manufacturer of a new drug must report any new information received concerning serious side effects, as well as the failure of the new drug to produce desired effects. If Health Canada determines it to be in the interest of public health, a notice of compliance for a new drug may be suspended and the new drug may be removed from the market.
 A post surveillance program involves clinical trials conducted after a drug is marketed (referred to as Phase 4 studies in the United States) and is an important source of information on as yet undetected adverse outcomes, especially in populations that may not have been involved in the premarketing trials (e.g., children, the elderly, pregnant women) and the drug’s long-term morbidity and mortality profile. Regulatory authorities may require companies to conduct Phase 4 studies as a condition of market approval. Companies often conduct post-marketing studies in the absence of a regulatory mandate.
 The foregoing description is a summary of the requirements for a new drug to be approved for marketing in North America. The EMA and Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency are also important regulatory authorities in drug development. Together with the FDA, they are the three International Conference on Harmonization parties which oversee the three largest markets for drug sales.
