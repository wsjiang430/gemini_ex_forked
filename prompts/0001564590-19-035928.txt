Our Business Units
 
Astrotech Technology, Inc.
 
There are a number of different market opportunities for the mass spectrometry technology that was originally developed by 1st Detect Corporation. ATI was formed to own and license the intellectual property, which includes 37 patents granted with five additional patents in process, for use in different fields. ATI currently licenses the intellectual property to 1st Detect Corporation for use in the security and detection market and to Agriculture Technology Corporation for use in the agriculture market.
 
1st Detect Corporation
 
1st Detect, a licensee of ATI, has developed the TRACER 1000™, the world’s first certified mass spectrometer (“MS”)-based explosives trace detector (“ETD”), designed to replace the explosives and narcotics trace detectors used at airports, secured facilities, and borders worldwide. We believe that government and airport customers are unsatisfied with the currently deployed ETD technology, which is driven by an antiquated technology known as Ion Mobility Spectrometry (“IMS”). We believe that IMS-based ETDs are fraught with false positives, as they often misidentify personal care products and other common household chemicals as explosives, causing unnecessary passenger delays and frustration, significant wasted security resources, and lack of security personnel confidence in ETDs. In addition, there are hundreds of different types of explosives, but IMS-based ETDs have a very limited threat detection library reserved only for those several explosives of largest concern. In fact, we believe that adding additional compounds to the detection library of an IMS-based ETD reduces the instrument’s performance further, causing more false alarms. In contrast, adding additional compounds does not degrade the TRACER 1000’s detection capabilities, as it has what we believe to be a virtually unlimited and easily expandable threat library. With terrorist threats becoming more numerous, sophisticated, and lethal, security professionals have been looking for better instrumentation to address the evolving threats.
 
MS has historically been reserved for highly trained professionals in high-end laboratories with large budgets. 1st Detect has overcome the significant challenge of making this sophisticated MS technology powerful, yet simple to use, with an easy-to-understand red light or green light output, at a price that is competitive with IMS. In addition to an increased probability of detection, decreased false alarm rate, and a virtually unlimited threat library that is field-upgradable, we believe that the 1st Detect ETD can increase passenger throughput and save billions of dollars in wasted airport security personnel resources. With more than 30,000 IMS instruments installed in the field, many of which are nearing their end of life or are unable to be updated to the newest standards, 1st Detect is positioned to be a leader in securing worldwide checkpoints.
 
Either Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) or European Civil Aviation Conference (“ECAC”) certification is necessary to sell the TRACER 1000 to the airport market. On June 19, 2018, the Company announced that the TRACER 1000 had entered the ECAC Common Evaluation Process (“CEP”) to obtain certification in Europe. On December 12, 2018, the Company announced that the TRACER 1000 passed the ECAC CEP tests for airport checkpoint screening of passengers. On January 9, 2019, the Company subsequently announced that the TRACER 1000 passed the CEP tests for airport cargo screening. On February 21, 2019, the Company announced that 1st Detect received ECAC certification for both passenger and cargo screening for the TRACER 1000. Finally, on June 26, 2019, the Company announced the official launch of the TRACER 1000. As the TRACER 1000 is the first MS-based ETD to have ever passed either U.S. or European regulatory testing, there has been considerable interest from prospective customers, which has yielded a number of successful demos and field trials.
 
In addition, on March 27, 2018, the Company announced that the TRACER 1000 was accepted into TSA’s Air Cargo Screening Technology Qualification Test (“ACSQT”) and, on April 4, 2018, the Company announced that the TRACER 1000 was beginning testing with TSA for passenger screening at airports. With similar protocols as ECAC testing, we have received positive feedback under both programs, as anticipated. Both programs continue to progress as expected; however, there is no assurance that the TRACER 1000 will be approved by either TSA program.

Agriculture Technology Corporation
 
AG-TECH, a licensee of ATI, has developed the AG-LAB-1000™ series of trace detectors for use in the agricultural market. The technology is ideal for detecting trace levels of pesticides in agricultural products.in real-time. With the increasing number of U.S. states and countries legalizing hemp and cannabis, pesticide regulations have become increasingly more important. In addition to detecting pesticides, the AG-LAB-1000 instrumentation can characterize and quantify the cannabinoids (including tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”), cannabidiol (“CBD”), and many other constituents) and terpenes (aromatic oils) present in hemp and cannabis. This information can be used by growers, distributors, and retailers to customize products, to ensure quality control, or to verify delivered products match the order. It can also be used by regulators and law enforcement to track and trace products.
Astral Images Corporation
 
Astral Images is a developer of advanced film restoration and enhancement software. Astral’s intelligent algorithms remove dust, scratches, and defects from film while converting the content to a digital format with significantly enhanced resolution. In addition, Astral employs artificial intelligence (“AI”) to automatically extend the color gamut and enhance the dynamic range to be viewed in 4K and/or high-dynamic range (“HDR”), collectively known as ultra-high definition (“UHD”).
 
Although we believe Astral has developed valuable technology fortified by patents and trade secrets, the potential market has not evolved as quickly as anticipated. Due to funding constraints, the Company’s primary focus remains on the pursuit of opportunities for 1st Detect. Consequently, headcount and expenditures at Astral have been minimized and new development is exclusively focused on strategic initiatives that would facilitate the realization of Astral’s value.
 
Business Strategy
 
1st Detect
 
There are more than 30,000 IMS instruments deployed in the field today, with many nearing their end of life. As the current generation of IMS technology is replaced, we are working to position the Company as the next-generation solution for the ETD market with the introduction of the world’s first ETD driven by a mass spectrometer. With mass spectrometry being the gold standard of chemical detection, an MS-ETD significantly improves detection capabilities, dramatically reduces the number of false positives, and allows for a much more expansive library of compounds of interest, yielding an instrument that we believe is far superior to the currently deployed IMS instruments, at a similar price point.
 
While most of our activities have been focused on developing explosives and narcotics detection for airports and cargo facilities, we believe there is significant opportunity in other government agencies and in the industrial and commercial markets as well. Such markets are large and diverse, often requiring customized solutions to satisfy customer needs. Significant effort is therefore only reserved for customer-funded development programs or programs with large markets where our technology has a unique differentiator.
 
Agriculture Technology Corporation
 
With increasing regulation in the hemp and cannabis market, processors are increasingly being required to send samples to a laboratory for testing to certify that the product does not include an unacceptable level of pesticides. This process can take five to eight days before results are available. This is a major problem because the presence of pesticides can contaminate the instrumentation used for processing, which can then contaminate subsequent batches, leading to potentially millions of dollars in wasted product. The AG-LAB-1000 can identify the presence of pesticides in seconds and alert the user accordingly, leading to significant savings. ATI is initially launching the Processing Series of products to continuously monitor the process flow of the extraction and distillation processes to detect the presence of pesticides.
Astral Images
 
Astral provides the state-of-the-art software solution for image restoration and enhancement by deriving significant efficiencies through its powerful AI platform to an industry that traditionally relies on expensive manual labor for image correction and enhancement that can be inconsistent and fraught with errors and omissions. While the Company looks to

Astral Images
 
Astral is positioned to leverage the demand generated for 4K/HDR content by the release of the new 4K/HDR standard and the growth in sales of next-generation 4K/HDR televisions. Consumers are increasingly demanding content that is optimized for their new televisions, but the conversion of content lags the sale of televisions capable of displaying that content, similar to what we saw with the proliferation of HDTV and 3D. In order to remain relevant in over-the-top distribution (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc.), content owners will need to convert their content to conform to the new standards. Astral is positioned to facilitate this market when industry investment in content conversion to 4K/HDR accelerates, but has focused its efforts on exploring strategic alternatives at this time.
Competition
 
1st Detect
 
Competition for the TRACER 1000 comes from ion mobility spectrometers and traditional mass spectrometers.
 
There are several vendors that compete directly with 1st Detect; however, 1st Detect products combine a number of attributes in a single product not currently available in other products. While 1st Detect’s focus is on replacing IMS-based ETDs, it also competes with traditional mass spectrometry solutions and our products have a number of attractive features that we believe give it a competitive advantage in an attractive market niche.

Ion Mobility Spectrometers | 1st Detect 
•High false alarms •Lower probability of detection •Numerous unscheduled bake-outs and calibrations •Limited library of compounds of interest •Fixed library requiring hardware changes to update •Causes delays at security/inspection checkpoints •Low price chemical detector | •Near-zero false alarm rate •Higher probability of detection •Near 100% up-time •Unlimited library of compounds of interest •Instantaneous library updates •Improves throughput at checkpoints •Competitive with IMS


Traditional Mass Spectrometers | 1st Detect 
•Very high price •Laboratory-quality sensitivity, specificity, and performance •Cumbersome clear-out and recalibration process •Large footprint •Heavy •Non-portable •High power requirements •Tandem mass spectrometry (“MS/MS”) available on high-end instruments •Stored Waveform Inverse Fourier Transform (“SWIFT”) available on select instruments | •Much lower price •Laboratory-quality sensitivity, specificity, and performance •Automated calibration •Small footprint •Relatively light •Portable •Low power requirements •MS/MS provides secondary confirmation of an analysis •SMART (“Sinusoidal Multiplexed Array in Real Time”), an improved version of SWIFT, selectively eliminates specific chemicals to reduce false positives

Agriculture Technology Corporation
 
We believe the AG-LAB-1000 is the only solution on the market that can detect the presence of all regulated pesticides in real-time. There are many laboratories that provide detailed analysis for the hemp and cannabis market, but they traditionally require samples to be sent to their laboratory with results taking between five to eight days. We believe customers have a growing desire to have the analysis in real-time.
