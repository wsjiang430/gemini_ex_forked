ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
 Overview
 Sun Hydraulics Corporation, doing business as Helios Technologies (“Helios,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”), and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is an industrial technology leader that develops and manufactures solutions for both the hydraulics and electronics markets. On August 6, 2018, we announced the adoption of Helios Technologies as our business name. Sun Hydraulics, LLC (“Sun Hydraulics” or “Sun”) (a newly-formed Florida limited liability company that holds the historical net operating assets of the Sun Hydraulics brand entities and Custom Fluidpower Pty Ltd, “Custom Fluidpower” or “CFP”), along with Enovation Controls, LLC (“Enovation Controls”) and Faster S.r.l. (“Faster”), are the three wholly-owned operating subsidiaries of Helios Technologies under the new holding company name. 
 We operate in two business segments, Hydraulics and Electronics. The Hydraulics segment consists of the global Sun Hydraulics companies, Faster, acquired in the second quarter of 2018, and Custom Fluidpower, acquired in the third quarter of 2018. Sun Hydraulics serves the hydraulics market as a leading manufacturer of high-performance screw-in hydraulic cartridge valves, electro-hydraulics, manifolds, and integrated package solutions for the worldwide industrial and mobile hydraulics markets. Faster is a leading global manufacturer of quick release hydraulic coupling solutions focused in the agriculture, construction equipment and industrial markets. Custom Fluidpower is a global provider of hydraulic, pneumatic, electronic and instrumentation solutions to a broad range of industries including agriculture, industrial, mining and material handling. The Electronics segment, comprised of Enovation Controls, LLC, is a global provider of innovative electronic control, display and instrumentation solutions for both recreational and off-highway vehicles, as well as stationary and power generation equipment.  Our operational organization chart is presented below.

Sun Hydraulics was founded in 1970 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Helios with its headquarters in Sarasota, Florida.  The majority of Sun’s manufacturing operations reside in Sarasota with additional operations in the U.K., Germany and South Korea, as well as sales offices in China, India and South America.  Enovation Controls, which was acquired on December 5, 2016 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Helios, was formed in 2009 in connection with the reorganization of Murphy Group, Inc. and EControls Group, Inc. which were founded in 1939 and 1994, respectively.  Enovation Controls operates the majority of its manufacturing in Tulsa, OK with sales and engineering capabilities in Texas, the U.K., China and India.  Faster, which was acquired on April 5, 2018 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Helios, was formed in 1951.  Headquartered near Milan, Italy, Faster has manufacturing operations co-located with its headquarters as well as in Ohio and India.  Additionally, the company has sales offices in China, Brazil and Germany.  Helios acquired Custom Fluidpower as a wholly owned subsidiary on August 1, 2018.  Custom Fluidpower has eight locations throughout Australia where engineering solutions are provided, four of which operate as value-add distributors.  The remaining four locations conduct repair work for hydraulics systems.
 Until 2016, we operated primarily in the hydraulics market with a small presence in the electronics market. The expansion of our electronic and digital capabilities through the acquisition of Enovation Controls was a significant step towards achieving our Vision 2025 goals.  The acquisition further diversified our business, granting us access to the new, highly specialized marine, power generation and recreational vehicle markets and customers seeking complete machine control.  Enovation Controls also brought a strong talent pool with a proven track record of new product development and technical innovation, complementing our existing competencies.  
 We believe our 2018 acquisitions of Faster and Custom Fluidpower are also in alignment with our Vision 2025 goals, advancing the Company as a global technology leader in the industrial goods sector while maintaining superior profitability and financial strength.  Faster further diversifies the Company more deeply into the global agriculture market and broadens the Company’s global footprint, advancing our “in the region, for the region” initiative by providing a manufacturing hub in Europe.  Custom Fluidpower provides regional value-add capabilities to continue successful penetration of the Asia Pacific (“APAC”) region and particularly Southeast Asia, further evolving our “in the region, for the region” initiative. 
 We have been profitable every year since 1972 and Sun has paid a dividend every quarter since going public in January 1997. 
 The Company’s executive offices are located at 1500 West University Parkway, Sarasota, Florida 34243, and our telephone number is (941) 362-1200. Our websites include www.heliostechnologies.com, www.sunhydraulics.com, www.enovationcontrols.com, www.fastercouplings.com and www.custom.com.au.

Strategy & Vision 2025
  In 2016, we announced our Vision 2025.  We believe we can reach a critical mass of $1 billion in annual sales by 2025 while remaining a technology leader in the industrial goods sector.  An important aspect of our 2025 vision is that we believe we can maintain superior profitability and financial strength throughout the period of growth. There are two significant components to reaching the revenue goal: organic growth and acquisitions.  We expect that, by 2025, up to $930 million of the anticipated annual $1 billion in revenue will result from organic growth of our existing segments (approximately $730 million from our Hydraulics segment and $200 million from our Electronics segment), with the remaining $70 million to be derived from acquisitions of companies that advance our technology position with adjacent products for the industrial goods sector and broaden our geographic reach.  We will seek acquisition targets that will bring us advanced technologies in the industrial goods sector.  Financially, targets should be accretive in the first year and contribute to maintaining Helios’s superior profitability and financial strength long-term.  This is imperative to creating lasting shareholder value.  Our current initiatives for organic growth include new product development, penetrating new geographic markets, expanding sales and marketing efforts in existing geographies, developing new channels to market to reach customers not currently in Helios’s purview and further diversifying our end market penetration. 
 Helios’s strategic roadmap includes product and service differentiation, disciplined and thoughtful leadership throughout our global organization and ensuring that all processes and activities consider the view of the customer.  We have identified and have begun applying several tactics to execute our strategies which include capitalizing on our unique and deeply rooted values, structured human capital development and differentiated engineering for both products and processes.  Internal key performance indicators are used on a daily basis to align our short-term actions with our long-term strategy.
 A primary focus of our strategic thinking is the identification of megatrends which will impact the future capital equipment and industrial goods markets.  We have identified three megatrends: globalization, growing sophistication of safe machinery and equipment and increased computing power, as further described below: 
 Globalization. We believe global population growth and urbanization, driven predominantly by Asian mega-cities, will generate ongoing demand for infrastructure projects, resources and food production, all of which require equipment and machinery from our key end markets.  
 4
 
Sophistication of safe machinery and equipment.  Machine users increasingly demand safety, productivity, efficiency, and even automated control. Advancements in the design of these machines require continuous evolution of critical components such as hydraulic and electronic functionality and control.  
 Increased computing power.  In the current electronic and digital age, electronics are increasingly used to activate processes which were once activated only manually or mechanically.  Information is increasingly being converted into a form that allows it to be processed, stored and transmitted digitally, resulting in both time and energy savings.  
 Our culture of innovation is at the core of our business. We have approximately 250 engineers in support of product innovation, as well as technical support and customer service.  We believe our product innovation will aid organic growth and fill the expected demand resulting from the identified megatrends.  All growth initiatives are intended to preserve Helios’s history of superior profitability and financial strength.
 Business Segments
 Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2016, we are organized into two operating and reporting segments: Hydraulics and Electronics.  The Hydraulics segment consists of all of the Sun Hydraulics, Faster and Custom Fluidpower companies globally.  The Electronics segment consists of the Enovation Controls business. Financial information about our business segments is presented in Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.  
Hydraulics
 There are three key technologies within our Hydraulics segment:  cartridge valve technology (“CVT”), quick-release hydraulic couplings solutions (“QRC”) and hydraulic system design (“Systems”).
 Within CVT, our products provide functions important to a hydraulic system: to control rates and direction of fluid flow and to regulate and control pressures.  Our CVT products use a fundamentally different design platform compared to most other competitive product offerings, which are often referred to as industry common products. The floating construction that we pioneered results in a self-alignment characteristic that provides performance and reliability advantages compared to most competitors’ product offerings. This floating construction differentiates our products from those of most of our competitors, who design and manufacture rigid screw-in cartridge valves that fit a common cavity.  Our cartridge valves, offered in five size ranges and including both electrically actuated and non-electrically actuated products, were designed to be able to operate reliably at higher pressures, making them equally suitable for both industrial and mobile applications.  Sun’s product development approach yields a product line of extreme breadth and depth compared to our competitors.  Our broad scope of product offerings, coupled with the high-performance characteristics of our cartridge valves, makes Sun a leader in the industry. 
 QRC products allow users to connect and disconnect quickly from any hydraulic circuit without leakage, and ensure high-performance under high temperature and pressure using one or multiple couplers.  Quick connection of multiple hydraulic lines can be accomplished through the use of a MultiFaster or casting solution.  Simultaneous connection of several lines is an important feature in many applications and allows for dramatic reduction of connection time, even when the system is under pressure. Faster is a leading global manufacturer of QRC solutions. We design, engineer and distribute hydraulic coupling solutions focused in the agriculture, construction equipment and industrial markets.  Exposure to the agriculture market was one of the drivers that led to our acquisition of Faster.  This is a key end market for hydraulic applications and Faster’s strong presence in the agriculture market further diversifies Helios’s end market exposures.

Systems provide engineered solutions for machine users, manufacturers or designers to fulfill complete system design requirements including electro-hydraulic, remote control, electronic control and programmable logic controller systems, as well as automation of existing equipment.  The systems we manufacture are:
  
• | highly efficient,
--+------------------


• | increase and optimize productivity,
--+------------------------------------


• | introduce safer operating procedures,
--+--------------------------------------


• | are smaller in size than competitive products,
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | allow for ease of maintenance, and
--+-----------------------------------


• | reduce energy costs.
--+---------------------

 Sun routinely competes in the custom integrated package market.  An integrated package is a customized system solution comprised of multiple cartridge valves assembled in a custom designed manifold for a specific original equipment manufacturers’ (“OEM”) machine.  The functionality of the integrated package system is generally specified by the OEM and then designed by Sun or a distributor channel partner. 
 Custom Fluidpower’s systems provide cost effective alternatives to purchasing new machinery to upgrade, overhaul and automate existing equipment. We also provide full installation and commissioning services for our systems world-wide.  Field services are offered for our systems to assist in minimizing downtime, managing breakdowns and routine servicing. Additionally, we offer a comprehensive and fully inclusive asset management program to ensure the ongoing maintenance of the system. We have the ability to manage systems from conception to installation, and provide ongoing maintenance and support. 
 For many decades, the Hydraulics segment has provided global capital goods industries with innovative product solutions for hydraulic components and systems used to transmit power and control force, speed and motion. Our products typically add a fine degree of precision, reliability and safety to the machinery and equipment in which they are used.  Business activities at our global locations include new product development, component and system design, manufacturing, sales, technical support, inventory warehousing and distributor management.
 Our hydraulics products are sold globally through a combination of wholly-owned companies, representative sales offices, independent channel partners, which include value-add distributors and integrators, and OEMs.  Our global channel partner network includes representation in many industrialized markets. 
 Hydraulic systems are increasingly taking signals from on-board electronic control systems, making it necessary for hydraulic products to be capable of digital communication.  In response to this, in recent years, we have aggressively expanded our CVT offering of electrically-actuated cartridge valves.  In 2017, we introduced FLeX™, a new electro-hydraulic product line offering high-performance electro-hydraulic products.  Throughout 2018, we continued to introduce new products under the FLeX™ Series, further expanding our electro-hydraulic product offering for both the mobile and industrial hydraulics markets. The valves are designed to outperform comparable valves in the market. They are virtually leak-proof poppet-style valves that deliver consistently better pressure drop. Coil options include interchangeable low-power, high power and hazardous location (explosion-proof) versions for expanded configuration flexibility.  The FLeX™ Series valves use Sun’s unique floating-style design, adding an extra layer of security in those harsh applications where torque and force can become excessive.

Electronics
 In 2016, we acquired Enovation Controls to further develop our digital and electronic capabilities.  A portion of the product portfolio offered by Enovation Controls serves end markets also served by our Hydraulics segment such as off-highway vehicles including construction, agricultural and utility vehicles as well as material handling equipment.  However, the majority of Enovation’s products are sold into end markets not historically served by our Hydraulics segment such as marine, power generation and recreational vehicles.  This provides additional diversification of Helios’s revenue base. 
 Enovation Controls is a leader in display and control integration solutions offering rugged and reliable instruments, coupled with expertise in J1939 engine protocol, to produce an industry-leading array of easy-to-read displays and gauges for controller area network (“CAN”) transmitted engine data and faults. We refer to this technology as Electronic Controls (“EC”).  Our focus is on creating niche products that are customized to the machine in which they are installed in volumes of 1,000 to 10,000 per year.  This allows us to target customers or industries that see value in this level of integration, and as a result our customer list contains a wide variety of OEM applications. Product categories include traditional mechanical and electronic gauge instrumentation, plug and go CAN-based instruments, after-market support through global distribution, robust environmentally sealed controllers, hydraulics controllers, engineered panels and application specialists, process monitoring instrumentation, proprietary hardware and software development and wiring harness design and manufacturing.
 We offer our customers the ability to customize graphics for our PowerView™ line of LCD displays with focus on the customization of the operator interface: larger, full-graphic displays; flexible hardware configurations; multi-language support; class-leading environmental protection; and software tools that deliver the ultimate solution for OEM and distributor display customization and CAN control.  Our displays offer easy-to-read, bonded LCD graphical views with the industry's best readability even in direct sunlight or harsh water conditions.  Our controllers are built with the ability to withstand a wide ambient temperature range.  
 Our panel solutions offer customized design and simple, turnkey solutions. Our Industrial Panel Division offers engineers dedicated to applications, wire harnesses, panels and software development. Engineers focus entirely on custom and standard solutions built to desired specifications.  Our services for design and development include on-site installation and testing with reviews to ensure the solution works with the application out of the box.  
 Through our HCT™ brand, we design and manufacture electronic controllers that manage the function of electrically actuated hydraulic components. HCT™ brand products range from simple one valve, manually adjusted controllers to fully integrated hydraulic control systems managing multiple hydraulic valves as well as other input and output products such as joysticks and displays. All controllers are potted and therefore impervious to outside influence, making them ideal for mobile, industrial and marine applications.

Globally, electronics products are sold primarily direct to OEM customers, with about 20% sold through independent, authorized channel partners.  Beginning in 2018, we commenced a strategic initiative to further diversify our channels to market as well as our geographic reach.  Our expansion efforts will require the development of distribution partners globally, including on-boarding and training of these partners.  We feel that these efforts will assist in our ability to diversify our global customer base, allowing us to grow more quickly, diversify the end-markets we serve, and expand our customer base.  We have also shifted our focus from an end-market driven sales model to channel-driven sales model.  Historically end markets within the Electronics segment were divided into two lines of business: Power Controls (“PC”) and Vehicle Technologies (“VT”).  PC served a variety of end markets, including mobile equipment, industrial applications and agriculture with products such as displays, panels, gauges, controllers, battery chargers and various end devices.  VT served the recreational end market with products such as electronic controls, displays and instrumentation. Beginning in Q4 2018, Enovation Controls reorganized the management of the business into two distinct sales channels:  OEM and Distribution. 
 Engineering
 Engineers play an important role in all aspects of our business including design, manufacturing, sales, marketing and technical support. Engineers work within a disciplined set of design parameters that encourage the re-use and incorporation of existing parts and platforms into new products. Engineers work closely with manufacturing personnel to define the processes required to manufacture products reliably and consistently.
 Both of our segments have manufacturing engineers who are responsible for evaluating and changing manufacturing processes as well as implementing lean initiatives throughout global operations.   
 Hydraulics
 Our Hydraulics segment engineers are comprised of three distinct groups: sustaining, innovation/R&D and systems.  The sustaining engineering group focuses on improving existing products, both from a design as well as a manufacturing perspective, including optimizing manufacturing costs.  The innovation/R&D engineering group is responsible for new product development and evaluating future needs, from a product perspective, of the hydraulics industry.  The systems engineering group focuses on system design and component integration to solve the complex needs of a specific application.  Additionally, our field application specialists are also engineers who provide local customer interface.
Electronics
 In our Electronics segment, approximately one-third of our employees are degreed engineers working across multiple disciplines, including electrical, mechanical, software, sales and application engineering. Our engineering teams:

• | focus on hardware design of new products,
--+------------------------------------------


• | work with customers to select a group of products to best fit a specific application or machine,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | create a customized look and feel for the customer interface, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | work directly with the customer to arrive at a fully functional and integrated system that meets the customer’s overall electronic control needs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Engineering of new products is often very fast paced and is completed in a collaborative manner with each OEM based on a product release date.  All engineering groups have significant interface with the customer which enables them to understand market demands and identify opportunities for technological advancement, driving market share gains.   
 8
 
New product development generally starts through collaboration with an OEM, driven by the need for innovative products at the machine level.  Once products are released and in use by OEMs, a standardized version typically becomes available for sale to distributors as well.  
 Joint Product Development 
 There are ongoing joint product development efforts among the engineering groups of Hydraulics and Electronics.  Electrification of machines was one of the global needs that will drive the megatrends identified in our strategic review and which led to our acquisition of Enovation Controls.  The know-how and technical competence of the engineers in the Electronics segment are being utilized to bring electrification to products and systems designed and manufactured within the Hydraulics segment. 
 In 2017, we introduced XMD which represents the first joint product development project between our Electronics and Hydraulics business segments. XMD is a compact, Bluetooth® configurable electro-hydraulic driver. XMD is a high-powered, electronic control device for electrically operated hydraulic actuators that is built to stand up to extreme environmental conditions in mobile and industrial applications. The XMD Bluetooth-configurable electro-hydraulic driver meets the needs of international mobile and industrial equipment. The XMD serves actuators used in on- and off-highway equipment in numerous applications including agriculture, forestry, construction, marine, earth moving and material handling.  Other joint products are currently in development and are expected to be introduced to the marketplace in the second half of 2019.  
 These joint development efforts are a key driver of the revenue synergies identified for our acquisitions.  We have a small focused group of engineers involved in these development projects to concentrate efforts and drive results.  Sun, Faster and Enovation Controls have core competencies within their own technology which must be preserved as it is what powered their historical success.  However, we see significant opportunities in bringing together the technology of hydraulics and electronics to create new products which will better serve future market trends.    
 Manufacturing
 Hydraulics
 We utilize process-intensive manufacturing operations that make extensive use of automated handling and assembly technology (including robotics), where possible, to perform repetitive tasks, thus promoting manufacturing efficiencies and workplace safety. We employ lean techniques to continually improve our productivity and efficiency. Sun and Faster have complementary manufacturing processes.  Sun relies on outside suppliers to perform high-volume machining operations for cartridge parts, but most critical finishing processes are completed in-house.  Conversely, Faster completes most of its machining operations in-house and outsources the finishing processes.  This provides the Hydraulics segment with an opportunity for Faster to manufacture machined parts for Sun.  Faster provides Helios with a manufacturing hub in Europe as we work toward our “in the region, for the region” goal.  CFP operates differently than Sun or Faster due to the nature of their business as a value-add distributor. They are focused primarily on systems and service versus pure manufacturing of components.  They purchase components from multiple manufactures and utilize them to design and build systems.
 We hold significant raw materials, work in process and finished goods in all of the businesses within the Hydraulics segment. The raw materials used, primarily aluminum and steel, are commercially available from multiple sources.  Finished goods consist of customer orders which are completed but have not been shipped.  We typically build to order, not to stock, so if we produce a part, it will be shipped to a customer on the next available shipping date.  
 9
 
In 2018, we negotiated long term agreements (“LTA”) with our key suppliers.  Terms and conditions of these agreements include pricing, annual quantity estimates, quality standards, safety stock quantities and lead time expectations.  The LTAs are intended to provide the Company and the supplier with a framework for effective long-term planning and utilization of assets. 
 We continually review all of our suppliers to improve the quality of incoming parts and to assess opportunities for better control of price, quality and lead times. We are in compliance with the following quality systems:
  
• | U.S. ISO 9001:2015 for the design, manufacture, and distribution of high performance screw-in hydraulic cartridge valves and manifolds used to control force, speed and motion in fluid power systems
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Italy ISO 14001:2015 for the design and production of hydraulic quick-release couplings and multiconnections for medium and high pressures made by machining and assembling
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Electronics
 We offer a wide range of advanced manufacturing and engineering capabilities, including mechanical and electrical hardware design, software design, product testing, in-house LCD bonding, panel and harness engineering and more.  State-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities include surface mount technology, x-ray inspection and LCD bonding. Multipoint functional testing is conducted to ensure quality control of our products before they are delivered to our customers.  We are a customer/project-based organization, backed by vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities. 
 A global integrated operating system, which utilizes intelligent approaches like lean manufacturing and six sigma for maximum productivity, allows us to identify and remove variables in our manufacturing and business processes. By pinpointing areas for improvement, we provide our customers with faster delivery time and higher quality products.  
 Our in-house manufacturing operations feature vertically integrated processes such as wire processing, sheet metal fabrication, LCD bonding, and surface mount technology (“SMT”) printed circuit board assembly.  Lean manufacturing designed cells are used for the final assembly of panel, instrument, and electronic products, and cells are networked to a manufacturing execution system (“MES”) database.  Products are serialized and functionally tested in process, and test results are recorded by product serial number in the MES database.
 We hold significant raw materials and finished goods inventory in our Tulsa, OK facility.  Finished goods inventory contains high demand items which require quick delivery.  Raw materials inventory generally has significant lead times; therefore, raw material inventory is held to enable us to fulfill orders based on customer request dates which are often less than three weeks.  
 We continually review all of our suppliers to improve the quality of incoming parts and to assess opportunities for better control of price, quality and lead times. We are in compliance with the following quality systems:

Sales and Marketing
 In 2018, no single customer made up more than 5% of consolidated net sales.  
 Hydraulics
 Approximately 75% of Helios’s sales are derived from the Hydraulics segment. Our 2018 Hydraulics segment sales are distributed fairly evenly among our three major geographic regions with 39% to the Americas, 34% to Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and 27% to APAC. Given our acquisitions in 2018, we have increased our global reach into the EMEA region with Faster, and our APAC presence has significantly grown with Custom Fluidpower.
 We market and sell hydraulic products through value-add distributors and directly to OEMs.  Globally, approximately 57% of sales are attributed to our channel partners who generally combine our products with other hydraulic components to design a complete hydraulic system.  Sales directly to an OEM for integration in their machines makes up the remaining 43%.  Sun relies very heavily on its distribution network in the U.S. with nearly 100% of sales in this region going through these channel partners.  In EMEA and APAC, CVT sales are split more evenly between OEMs and distribution.  Faster sells 75% of its products to global OEMs whereas the remainder of sales utilize worldwide distributors.  Technical support is provided by local experts based at each of our global operations.
 We provide end users with technical information through the websites of our operating companies and catalogues in multiple languages, including all information necessary to specify and obtain our products. We believe this approach helps stimulate demand for our products.  
 Electronics
 Electronic products are sold globally both to OEM customers and through distributors.  OEM sales constitute 80% of total Electronics segment sales.  Building strong partnerships with OEMs is a priority.  We rely on direct customer contacts to stimulate demand for our products.  We work closely with our OEM customers to design and deliver innovative reliable products for specific applications.  Twenty-four hour customer service support and an in-house technical service department is available before, during and after the initial sale to create sustainable partnerships with our customers.  
 In 2018, we moved our sales structure from sales teams that serviced PC and VT end markets to customer-centric sales teams dedicated to OEM and Distributor customer classifications.  Our OEM sales team collaborates with large OEMs, whereas the Distributor sales team works with a large number of distributors of varying sizes.  The reconfiguration of our sales teams will create a heavier focus on distributor sales with a dedicated team effort.  Overall, approximately 20% of segment sales are derived from independent, authorized distributor channel partners.
 Geographically, our 2018 Electronics segment sales represent 86% to the Americas, 8% to EMEA and 6% to APAC.  There is a well-defined initiative to grow sales in EMEA and APAC as part of Vision 2025.  Additionally, synergies identified at the time of acquisition utilize customer relationships from the Hydraulics segment to create pull through of electronic products.

Competition
 Hydraulics
 Competitors in the hydraulics market are broken down into three categories:  full-line hydraulics system producers, component only producers of CVT or QRC products, and low-cost producers. Most competitors market globally.  Full-line producers can provide complete hydraulic systems to their customers, including component functionally like those manufactured in our Hydraulics segment.  Component only producers are like Sun and Faster in that they only offer CVT or QRC products, while additional parts of the hydraulics system are obtained from other manufacturers.  Low cost producers are competitors who have emerged in low cost production areas such as Asia and Eastern Europe. These competitors will typically copy both our products and like products designed by competitors. Low cost producers typically have a limited product range compared to full line or cartridge valve only producers which limits their ability to be competitive. 
 We believe that we compete based upon the quality, reliability, price, value, speed of delivery and technological characteristics of our products and services.
 Electronics
 Competition within the electronics market is very broad with competitors ranging from large multi-national companies with a full electronics offering to small niche companies that specialize in one product type.  Enovation Controls is a niche player in the displays, controllers, gauges and instrumentation panel markets. 
 The market for products designed and manufactured by Enovation Controls is relatively fragmented with the top four to six companies comprising 70% of the market, mostly servicing the automotive space.  Enovation Controls differentiates itself through product quality, customization ability and service with a focus on mid-market niche markets that are not well served by the large competitors. 
 Our overall position in our key markets is defensible due to high barriers to switching suppliers, such as up-front engineering and programming costs, and positive perceptions among core customers on key selection criteria, including quality and service. 
 Employees
 As of December 29, 2018, we had approximately 2,065 full-time employees with 1,155 in the Americas, 570 in EMEA and 340 in APAC
.  We believe that relations with our employees are good.  Approximately 440 of our employees in Italy are represented by a union.  We have constructive and productive dialog on a regular basis with union leaders.  To the best of our knowledge, there is no labor dispute, strike, controversy, slowdown, work stoppage or lockout pending or threatened against or affecting the Company, nor is there any basis for any of the foregoing.  
Patents and Trademarks
 In addition to trade secrets, unpatented know-how, and other intellectual property rights, we own approximately 150 patents and trademarks relating to certain of our products and businesses.  We believe that the growth of our business is dependent upon the quality and functional performance of our products and our relationship with the marketplace, rather than on any single patent, trademark, copyright, or other item of intellectual property or group of patents, trademarks or copyrights.  However, our patents are important in the defense of our intellectual property from competitors who exploit product development that is not otherwise legally protected by its creator.
