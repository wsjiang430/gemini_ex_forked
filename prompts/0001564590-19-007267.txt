ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 Krystal Biotech, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” or “us,” or other similar pronouns) is a gene therapy company dedicated to developing and commercializing novel treatments for patients suffering from dermatological diseases. We have developed a proprietary gene therapy platform, which we refer to as the Skin TARgeted Delivery platform, or STAR-D platform, that consists of an engineered, patented (issued and pending), viral vector based on modified herpes simplex virus 1, or HSV-1, and skin-optimized gene transfer technology, to develop off-the-shelf treatments for dermatological diseases for which we believe there are no known effective treatments. We are initially using our STAR-D platform to develop treatments for rare or orphan dermatological indications caused by the absence of or a mutation in a single gene, and plan to leverage our platform in the future to expand our pipeline to include other dermatological indications and skin conditions.  
 Our lead product candidate, KB103 (bercolagene telserpavec), seeks to use topical gene therapy to treat dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, or DEB, a rare and severe genetic disease, for which there is currently no approved treatment. 
 DEB affects the skin and mucosal tissues and is caused by one or more mutations in a gene called COL7A1, which is responsible for the formation of protein type VII collagen, or COL7, that forms anchoring fibrils that bind the dermis, or inner layer of the skin, to the epidermis, or outer layer of the skin. In DEB patients, the genetic defect in COL7A1 results in loss or malfunctioning of these anchoring fibrils, leading to extremely fragile skin that blisters and tears from minor friction or trauma. Those who are born with DEB are sometimes called “butterfly children,” because their skin is likened to be as fragile as the wings of a butterfly. DEB patients may suffer from open wounds, skin infections, fusion of fingers and toes and gastrointestinal tract problems throughout their lifetime, and may eventually develop squamous cell carcinoma, a potentially fatal condition. Based on information from DEBRA International, a worldwide alliance of patient support groups for epidermolysis bullosa, or EB, of which DEB is a subset, we believe there may be as many as 52,000 cases worldwide who suffer from DEB. We estimate that there are, at present, approximately 3,000 to 3,500 diagnosed DEB patients in the United States. There is currently no approved cure for DEB and current treatment for DEB is limited to palliative care estimated to cost between $200,000 and $400,000 annually per patient in the United States.
 We are currently in Phase 2 of a Phase 1/2 clinical study of KB103 (GEM-1 study), a first-in-class topical gene therapy for the treatment of DEB. The trial commenced in May 2018 at Stanford University, and we announced positive interim results from this clinical study on two patients in October 2018. The clinical results to date on the two patients met all primary efficacy (presence of functional protein type VII collagen expression, observation of NC1 and NC2 reactive anchoring fibrils and continued expression following repeat administration) and safety endpoints (no adverse events, inflammation or irritation) in topically administered KB103 wounds. We anticipate announcing top-line data from full study enrollment of six (6) patients in the KB103 Phase 1/2 trial in the first half of 2019.  If successful, we anticipate commencing pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials for KB103 in the second half of 2019.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, have each granted KB103 orphan drug designation for the treatment of DEB, and the FDA has granted KB103 fast track designation and rare pediatric designation for the treatment of DEB. 
 
We believe our approach to treating DEB with KB103, is novel. The current standard of care for DEB patients is limited to palliative measures that seek to provide relief from some of the symptoms of DEB but do not meaningfully impact disease outcomes. Other known efforts to develop DEB treatments are employing autologous approaches to creating therapeutic products. Autologous treatments use a patient’s own tissues and cells to manufacture an individualized therapy. Such therapies tend to be expensive, invasive and time consuming to use, and require highly sophisticated medical teams and procedures. In contrast, KB103 is designed to be an off-the-shelf treatment for DEB that can be applied as needed, topically to a patient’s skin. Unlike the current standard of care, KB103 seeks to treat DEB at the molecular level through gene therapy and is intended to be a non-invasive treatment that can be used without requiring hospitalization or individually customized treatment. 
 
Our second pipeline candidate, KB105, is currently in preclinical development for treatment of patients with deficient autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, or ARCI, which is associated with transglutaminase 1, or TGM-1. There are currently no treatments for this disease that affects approximately 20,000 patients worldwide. We anticipate filing an Initial New Drug, or IND, application for KB105 in the first half of 2019. The FDA has granted KB103 orphan drug designation and rare pediatric designation for the treatment of ARCI.
 
We have several product candidates in various stages of preclinical development.  The following table summarizes information regarding our product candidates and development programs.
 

Recent Developments
 In March 2019, we appointed Julian Gangolli to the Board of Directors. Mr. Gangolli has more than three decades of senior management experience with large pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and start-up biotechnology companies.  He serves as President, GW Pharmaceuticals, North America, since his appointment in June 2015. Prior to joining Greenwich Biosciences, Mr. Gangolli, was, from 2004 until April 2015, President of the North American Pharmaceutical division of Allergan, Inc and was a Corporate Vice President and member of the Executive Committee, Allergan’s senior leadership team overseeing worldwide operations.  
In January 2019, we completed the construction of our own commercial scale cGMP-compliant manufacturing facility, Ancoris, to enhance supply chain control, increase supply capacity for clinical trials and ensure commercial demand is met in the event that KB103 receives marketing approval.  We intend to use our cGMP manufacturing process for all clinical and commercial production of KB103.  Although we anticipate that our manufacturing facility will be primary production site to meet project clinical and commercial demand, we will continue to evaluate, and will pursue as needed, additional internal 
 3

sources of manufacturing capacity, potential third parties to provide multiple long-term supply alternatives to meet commercial demand in the event that KB103 receives marketing approval and for our other pipeline programs.  We continue to utilize our internal process development group and work with third parties in order to evaluate and develop manufacturing process improvements that may increase the productivity and efficiency of our manufacturing process.   
 
On December 18, 2018 the United States Patent and Trademark Office or USPTO granted U.S. Patent No. 10,155,016 which covers compositions containing KB103, formulated for alternate routes of administration. 
 
On October 15, 2018, we announced positive interim results from placebo-controlled clinical Phase 1/2 study of KB103. Interim data from two adult patients treated with KB103 showed: 
  
• | Clearly detectable robust functional COL7 expression by immunofluorescence in biopsy samples as early as Day 2 of treatment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Functional anchoring fibril formation as early as day 14 of treatment and persisting up to the last biopsy in both patients;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Topically administered KB103 wounds closed in 2 weeks (as opposed to 10 weeks or not-at-all for control treated wounds) with durable wound-closure lasting greater than 3.5 months in both patients; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety data from both patients show that KB103 was well tolerated, even after repeat administration. No serious adverse events, and no product-related adverse events, were reported.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Additional detail of our Phase 1/2 study of KB103 can be found in our Current Report on Form 8-K as filed with the SEC on October 15, 2018 or at the link below:
 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1711279/000119312518298897/d638711dex992.htm
 On August 7, 2018, the FDA granted orphan drug and rare pediatric disease designation to the Company’s second product candidate, KB105, which is currently in preclinical development for treatment of patients with deficient autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, or ARCI, which is associated with transglutaminase 1, or TGM-1. There are currently no treatments for this disease that affects approximately 20,000 patients worldwide. We anticipate filing an Initial New Drug, or IND, application for KB105 in the first half of 2019. 
 
TGM-1 is an essential epidermal enzyme that facilitates the formation of the epidermal barrier, which prevents dehydration, and protects the skin from unwanted toxins and surface microorganisms. The loss of TGM-1-activity results in the severe genetic skin disease ARCI. Most patients with a TGM-1-deficiency exhibit life-long pronounced scaling with increased transepidermal water loss. The scales are plate-like, often of a dark color, and cover the whole-body surface area. TGM-1-deficient ARCI is associated with increased mortality in the neonatal period and has a dramatic impact on quality of life. KB105 is a replication-defective, non-integrating viral vector that can penetrate skin cells more efficiently than other viral vectors and has been engineered employing Krystal’s STAR-D platform to deliver functional human TGM-1 gene directly to the patients’ dividing and non-dividing skin cells. The high payload capacity of our viral vector allows it to accommodate large or multiple genes and its low immunogenicity makes it a suitable choice for direct and repeat delivery to the skin.
 
Our Strengths  
 We believe we are the first biotechnology company to develop a gene therapy for dermatological indications that can be used without requiring individually customized treatment, which we refer to as an “off-the-shelf” treatment. We believe our 
 4

organization and technology benefit from a singular set of strengths that will allow us to create and establish a leadership position in developing gene therapy treatments for dermatological indications. These strengths include: 
  
• | A first mover advantage in dermatological gene therapy with regards to an off-the-shelf gene therapy product candidate that can be applied topically by a local care-giver;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our STAR-D platform, a patented, proprietary, integrated gene therapy platform comprised of a library of optimized HSV-1 vectors and their complimentary cell lines with higher and more durable expression when compared with other viral vectors currently being used in dermatological gene therapy;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our recently constructed in-house state-of- the-art cGMP facility, Ancoris to enhance supply chain control, increase supply capacity for clinical trials and ensure commercial demand once marketing approval is obtained;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A proprietary process for both upstream (vector production) and downstream (purification) portions of the manufacturing process, which positions us to maximize scalability, quality and reliability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A scientific and management team with domain expertise in the HSV-1 viral vector and a track record of developing drugs from research to approval; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A strong patent estate, with two issued patents, that allows us the freedom to operate using modified HSV vectors for dermatological indications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy 
 Our objective is to develop and commercialize gene therapy treatments for dermatological indications. Our strategy to accomplish this objective is to initially focus on dermatological indications in the rare or orphan disease space, build out and leverage our in-house manufacturing capabilities, and then leverage our STAR-D platform to develop, manufacture and commercialize treatments for non-orphan indications within dermatology. 
 Why dermatology—We believe the characteristics of our STAR-D platform are ideal for application in dermatology because of HSV-1’s high tropism, or natural affinity, for skin cells. This allows the viral vector to penetrate skin cells more efficiently than other gene therapy vectors which makes topical delivery of gene therapy possible. Dermatology is also attractive because treatments for diseases affecting the skin have clearly defined, objective clinical endpoints with validated measurement tools that are accepted by the FDA. We believe these clearly defined endpoints will help accelerate the process of clinical development and regulatory approval for our dermatological products. 
 Why rare or orphan diseases—We believe there is significant unmet medical need for treatments for rare or orphan diseases, because the patient populations are not sizeable enough to attract the attention of large commercial entities. However, we believe there are advantages to developing in this space, including that these diseases are genetic and frequently affect children, and therefore have been studied extensively and have concentrated, supportive networks of key opinion leaders or KOLs, and patient advocacy groups. We have established strong relationships with such KOLs which we believe will aid us in obtaining data more rapidly and assist with the development and regulatory approval process. In addition, rare and orphan diseases, particularly monogenic ones like DEB, have defined clinical endpoints that have been validated by the FDA. There are also regulatory designations such as the FDA’s orphan drug designation, breakthrough drug designation, fast track drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation, one or more of which we believe, if successfully obtained, can provide certain regulatory and commercial advantages and incentives for developing treatments in this space. If we are able to successfully achieve one or more of these designations, we believe this will aid in the commercialization of our product candidates. 
 How we will manufacture— In January 2019, we completed the construction of our first state-of- the-art current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) facility. The 4,500 square foot facility has been designed to satisfy the necessary manufacturing requirements for the commercial development of KB103 and the highest current GMP standards governing commercial production for biopharmaceutical use. We believe there is value in maintaining control of our entire manufacturing process. We intend to continue to devote substantial resources to developing the STAR-D platform and to increase our in-house manufacturing capability with a second facility. 
 How we can expand—We believe we can eventually expand beyond rare and orphan diseases by leveraging our STAR-D platform and expertise in viral vector selection and design, physical vector delivery and vector manufacturing to pivot into other gene therapy treatments for dermatological applications. For example, we believe that the large payload capacity of the viral “backbone” in the STAR-D platform will allow us to deliver multiple genes and other effectors using the platform and afford us an opportunity to treat non-monogenic diseases like psoriasis, as well as conditions which are not necessarily the result of an inherited genetic defect, such as chronic wounds. If we are able to 
 5

successfully develop and commercialize products to treat non-orphan dermatological diseases, we intend to seek collaborative alliances towards commercializing these therapies among the broader population of patients in these indications. 
 
Our STAR-D Gene Therapy Platform 
 We believe that certain inherent features of the HSV-1 virus, combined with our ability to strategically modify the virus in the form we employ as our gene delivery backbone, provides our proprietary gene therapy platform, which we refer to as our STAR-D platform, with several advantages over other viral vector platforms for use in dermatological applications, including the following: 

• | Non-Integrating Nature: Conceptually, our STAR-D platform is similar in its simplicity, safety, and ease of use to other non-integrating gene therapy platforms like Adeno-Associated Virus, or AAV. Upon entry into cells, the HSV-1 vector persists as an episomal unit in the nucleus, meaning it remains physically separate from the host cell chromosome. Other vectors we are aware of currently being used in the development of gene therapy treatments for dermatological conditions, such as lentiviral and retroviral vectors, integrate into the host cell DNA in order to achieve gene expression. Integration into the host cell DNA carries the risk of disrupting host genes, and consequently can lead to a risk of causing cancer, or oncogenesis. In contrast, a non-integrating vector such as our HSV-1 vector does not carry the risk of disrupting the expression of host cell genes and the cancer-causing risks such disruptions could create.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Payload Capacity: HSV-1 is a large virus, approximately 150 kilobase, or Kb, pairs of DNA in size. We have made strategic deletions within this genome to remove critical “immediate early”, or IE, genes. These IE genes are required for expression of most of the downstream genes that allow the HSV-1 virus to replicate and destroy host cells. Deletion of these IE genes inhibits expression of most of the viral proteins, making the resulting viral vector replication-deficient and non-toxic. These deletions also enable the vector to easily accommodate a payload of 30Kb or greater without any significant impact on yield or titer. In KB103, we have successfully inserted two functional copies of the complete ~9Kb human COL7A1 gene. In contrast, packaging capacity for most other viral vectors being used in dermatological indications is under 8Kb which limits their ability to package large genetic materials. In addition, we believe the high payload capacity of our viral vector will allow us to insert single and multiple genes, allowing for the potential treatment of non-monogenic dermatological conditions such as psoriasis, atopic eczema and chronic wounds.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Skin Tropism: Poor infection of skin epithelia has remained a major hurdle for direct delivery of most viral vectors. HSV-1 has a natural affinity, or tropism, for the skin epithelium; therefore our viral vector penetrates skin cells much more efficiently than other viral vectors, resulting in transduction efficiencies or cell penetration as high as 95% in cell-based studies. This efficient cell infection or penetration ability, along with the high payload capacity of our vector discussed above, are responsible for the high levels of transgene expression in animal models. In addition, these factors are critical contributors to our ability to create an off-the-shelf gene therapy treatment where others are taking autologous approaches. Because the genes that cause many dermatological diseases are quite large, many of our competitors can only fit a single gene, or in some cases may need to manipulate the genetic material in order to fit the limited payload capacity of their vectors. From our review of published research, we estimate that some of these autologous gene therapy approaches may have transduction efficiencies as low as 10% in skin. In order to develop an effective treatment in the face of payload capacity and transduction limitations, they may need to introduce the therapeutic gene into a patient’s tissues or cells ex vivo to create an individual treatment, which is re-administered back to the patient once the gene-modified tissues have achieved a sufficient level of gene expression. The greater payload capacity of our vector and the high transduction efficiencies achieved allow us to deliver a full gene directly to any patient’s tissues for in vivo gene expression without additional manipulation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Immunogenicity: One of the major challenges with other viral vector platforms is that the host immune system may recognize them as foreign bodies and launch a robust immune response, resulting in toxicity and rapid removal of the virus. Wild type HSV-1 is known to persist in the body by becoming latent and hiding from the immune system. We have harnessed the natural ability of HSV-1 to evade host-mediated immunogenicity, while removing specific viral elements that exacerbate the host immunity, thus making the viral vector safer and allowing for repeat administration as needed to achieve durability of effect. Because the tendency of the viral vector to invoke an immune response is low, the ability of the HSV-1 vector to effectively deliver therapeutic genes is enhanced.

• | Stability: HSV-1 is extremely stable and resistant to degradation by shear, solvents and enzymes, facilitating purification and final formulation of our product candidates. These characteristics of HSV-1 provide a stability advantage to our KB103 product candidate. Although frozen for long-term storage, it is also stable under refrigerated conditions for short-term storage and shipment, and stable over several freeze-thaw cycles.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reproducible Manufacturing and Scalability: Successful production of viral vectors involves two steps: (i) the ‘upstream’ process, which yields a bulk virus harvest; and (ii) the ‘downstream’ process, which involves purification and concentration of the clinical product. Successful and reproducible execution of both processes is critical for clinical manufacturing and scale-up. Our scientific team collectively has over 20 years of experience and expertise in HSV engineering and purification that has allowed us to successfully optimize our HSV-1 vector production process.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Existing Regulatory Precedent: The first FDA- and EMA-approved oncolytic virus product, Imlygic® by Amgen, for treatment of melanoma, a skin cancer, is based on a genetically engineered HSV-1 virus. Because this product also employs an HSV-1 backbone, it has created a regulatory precedent for approval of an HSV-1-based therapy. In addition, Imlygic® is a chronic therapy, given bi-weekly, which provides support for the use of an HSV-1 backbone in chronic gene therapy of the type we are developing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing 
 Our proprietary manufacturing process for clinical grade KB103 was developed and optimized internally based on our STAR-D platform, and involves both an upstream production process and downstream purification step. Recombinant viral vectors are made safe by removal of most of the viral machinery, including packaging proteins, so that they are incapable of or attenuated for replicating in human cells. However, in order to produce the recombinant virus, these viral proteins have to be re-introduced to the process so that the viral vector can be packaged. In most other viral vector production systems, the missing viral proteins are supplied in one or more individual helper plasmids, along with the base viral vector plasmid. All the plasmids are then co-transfected into a production cell line in the presence of a transfection agent to facilitate viral vector production and packaging. The difficulty of this approach is that it requires c-scale manufacturing and qualification of each of the packaging plasmids and optimization of the transfection method. Even with optimized reagents and methods, significant batch-to-batch variability is seen in viral vector yield and titer that, we believe, drives up the cost of viral vector manufacturing and scale-up, and increases the risk of failure during manufacturing. 
 Our proprietary upstream process for HSV-1 production avoids the aforementioned issues associated with AAV production systems. Our process requires three critical components: 
  
• | Production of a master virus seed stock, or MVSS;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Production of complementing master cell bank, or MCB; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimized transduction parameters
--+----------------------------------

 The MVSS is scaled up from a single purified clone of the modified HSV-1 vector expressing the therapeutic COL7A1 gene. The MCB is a complementing cell line that stably expresses the HSV-1 viral proteins that are required for HSV-1 growth but have been deleted from the recombinant HSV-1 backbone. By introducing the deleted proteins into the MCB, as opposed to including them in the viral replication process via co-transfection of individual plasmids, we eliminate the need for multiple c qualifications of the plasmids or variability in transfection efficiency from batch to batch, that other production processes face. Infection of the MCB with the MVSS at the optimal concentration results in production of the viral particle. Once the MCB and MVSS and the conditions of infection are established, virus production and resultant yield and titer are highly reproducible and scalable over multiple runs and the risk of failure is minimal. 
 Optimization of MCB, MVSS and production methods requires extensive knowledge and technical experience with the HSV-1 genome and significant upfront effort to design and select the best virus seed stock and complementing cell line. To date we have screened through hundreds of cell line clones to find the best complementing cell lines, and similarly designed and generated the optimal virus seed stocks for our portfolio candidates. The viral seed stock expresses the therapeutic proteins under the control of strong constitutive or tissue-specific promoters, and additional non-coding regulatory sequences have been included to optimize gene expression. We have also optimized the transduction conditions to reproducibly obtain high yields of the virus. 
 Unlike the upstream process, steps used to purify and concentrate the viral vector product are often common across different viral vector platforms, and usually involve multiple stages of clarification, concentration, and diafiltration with the ultimate goal to remove contaminants and concentrate the product. We believe that we have successfully developed a robust 
 7

and reproducible process for purifying our viral vector to required concentrations for clinical use, while successfully removing contaminants to meet FDA guidelines. 
 We believe that the MVSS and MCB are a vital part of the production of KB103, as they will ensure the reproducible production of multiple clinical batches in a short six-week cycle time frame and in a cost-effective manner. 
 We have made significant investments in developing the most comprehensive and optimized manufacturing process for our vector product candidate including: 
  
• | sufficient scale to support stability of KB103 with sufficient longevity that a small number of initial batches will likely provide adequate clinical supply up to pivotal Phase 3 trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a proprietary vector manufacturing technique that produces a highly purified KB103;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A critical list of GMP assays to accurately characterize our process and the HSV-1 vectors we produce; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a series of high-efficiency purification processes, which can be adapted and customized for our HSV-1 platform products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe these improvements and our continued investment in our STAR-D platform will enable us to develop best in class, next generation gene therapy products for dermatological indications. 
 
Our HSV-1 Product candidates
 KB103 (bercolagene telserpavec) for the treatment of Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa
 Background on Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa
 DEB belongs to a group of genetic skin diseases known more broadly as epidermolysis bullosa, or EB, characterized by genetic defects of structural proteins of the skin, resulting in skin fragility and the formation of blisters. Blisters form as a result of rubbing, trauma or even in some cases from slight contact such as a simple hug. The subtypes of EB are distinguished by the location of the blister in the skin. DEB is associated with mutations in the gene coding for COL7, a major component of the anchoring fibrils which anchor the top layer of skin, called the epidermis, to an underlying layer, called the dermis, and provide structural adhesion in a normal individual. The lack of COL7 in DEB patients causes blisters to occur in the dermis as a result of separation from the epidermis. Genetic linkage studies have identified COL7A1 as the gene responsible for DEB. Over 200 distinct mutations in COL7A1 have been identified in DEB patients. 
 The most severe form of DEB is recessive DEB, or RDEB, in which both COL7 and anchoring fibrils are severely diminished in the patient’s skin due to null mutations in the COL7A1 gene. As a result, RDEB is characterized by severe skin blistering, extremely fragile skin, mutilating scarring of the hands and feet, joint contractures, strictures of the esophagus, and often, eventually the development of aggressive squamous cell carcinomas which may shorten the patient’s life. DEB also occurs in the form of dominant DEB, or DDEB, which is considered to be a more mild form of DEB. In DDEB blistering is often limited to the hands, feet, knees, and elbows, and often improves somewhat with age. 
 Currently, there is no effective therapy for any form of DEB, and RDEB patients have a low life expectancy. Nearly 10% of RDEB patients die before the age of 10, almost 40% die by the age of 20, and over 70% die before the age of 30. Persistent blistering begins at birth and contributes to the high mortality risk due to bacterial infection. In a study of 41 RDEB patients, the infectious causes of pneumonia and sepsis resulted in death in close to 15% and 10% of cases, respectively. Patients who survive bacterial sepsis during early infancy are at a high risk of later developing more severe complications such as growth retardation due to gastrointestinal involvement, multifactorial anemia, esophageal strictures, corneal scarring and/or progressive blindness, renal failure, progressive hand and foot deformities, muscle contractures that restrict movement, anemia, esophageal strictures, rapid tooth decay, nail deformities, and hair loss. The onset of aggressive squamous cell carcinoma, sepsis or malnutrition due to an inability or unwillingness to eat due to mouth or esophagus involvement, may also result in death among these patients. 
 Existing Treatments for DEB
 At present, there are no FDA- or EMA-approved treatments for DEB. The management of DEB currently consists of palliative care, which generally consists of prevention of mechanical forces that produce new blisters, wound care, nutritional support, and infection control, all of which help treat the symptoms but not the causes of DEB. We estimate that the annual cost of palliative care for a DEB patient is in the range of approximately $200,000 to $400,000 per year. Wound care usually includes treatment of new blisters by lancing and draining. Wounds are then dressed with a non-adherent material, covered with padding for stability and protection, and secured with an elastic wrap for integrity. Due to the increased risk of bacterial 
 8

resistance, topical antibiotic ointments and antimicrobial dressings are typically reserved for those wounds that are colonized with bacteria and fail to heal, referred to as “critical colonization.” 
 Individuals with DEB have increased caloric and protein needs due to the increased energy utilized in wound healing. Involvement of the digestive system in RDEB may limit nutritional intake. Infants and children with RDEB may require nutritional support, including a gastrostomy feeding tube. Anemia is typically treated with iron supplements and transfusions as needed. Other nutritional supplements may include calcium, vitamin D, selenium, carnitine and zinc. 
 Surveillance is important for individuals with DEB. Biopsies of abnormal-appearing wounds that do not heal may be recommended in some types of DEB due to predisposition to squamous cell carcinoma, beginning in the second decade of life. Screening for deficiencies of iron, zinc, vitamin D, selenium, and carnitine is typically recommended after the first year of life. Routine echocardiograms are recommended to identify dilated cardiomyopathy, and bone mineral density studies are recommended to identify osteoporosis. It is also typically recommended to avoid activities and bandages (including all adhesives) that may traumatize the skin. 
 Our approach to treating DEB 
 Our gene therapy approach uses a modified HSV-1 vector designed to deliver fully functional COL7A1 gene into the patient’s skin cells. Upon direct delivery to the skin, KB103 can efficiently transduce both keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Following entry of KB103 into the cell, the drug is transported down microtubules to the nucleus, and the viral genome is deposited into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, it recruits the host cellular machinery to initiate transcription of COL7A1. The COL7A1 transcripts allow for production of a precursor protein, Procollagen 7, that is secreted by the cell and processed by enzymes to remove extra protein segments from the ends. Once these molecules are processed, they arrange themselves into long, thin bundles of mature COL7 that form anchoring fibrils. The anchoring fibrils hold the epidermis and dermis together and are essential for maintaining the integrity of the skin. 
 KB103 is a replication-defective, non-integrating viral vector that has been engineered using our STAR-D platform to deliver functional human COL7A1 genes directly to patients’ dividing and non-dividing skin cells. Non-integrating vectors do not combine with the host cell’s DNA and express proteins separately from it. As a result, they do not disrupt the functioning of the host genes or present the cancer-causing risks associated with such disruption. We believe our STAR-D platform provides an optimal approach for treating dermatological conditions due to the nature of the HSV-1 viral vector we have created. Our viral vector has a natural tropism to the outermost layer of the epidermis, or skin epithelium, and we believe it can penetrate skin cells more efficiently than other viral vectors used in gene therapy. Our viral vector also has a high capacity or payload relative to most vectors, so it can accommodate multiple copies of large genes like COL7A1 and may allow us to insert multiple genes to develop combinatorial therapies for dermatological conditions like psoriasis, and chronic wounds in the future.
 
The high payload capacity of the HSV-1 vector allows us to insert two copies of the COL7A1 gene into each viral vector backbone, facilitating high expression of Procollagen 7. Current autologous therapies in development for DEB use lentivirus or retrovirus which have limited payload capacity and low transduction efficiencies. In addition, those viral vectors can target either keratinocytes or fibroblasts for gene delivery, but not both. In order to develop an effective treatment in the face of these limitations, autologous approaches treat the patient’s tissues or cells ex vivo for re-administration once sufficient gene expression is achieved, which leads to an extremely expensive, invasive and time consuming treatment requiring highly sophisticated medical teams and procedures. We believe that the limited payload capacity of lentivirus and retrovirus along with low transduction efficiencies will make it very difficult, if not impossible, to develop off-the-shelf gene therapies for DEB with these viral vectors. In contrast, KB103 can transduce not only keratinocytes and fibroblasts but also all skin cells that it comes in contact with to produce optimum therapeutic levels of secreted COL7 protein. It has been shown in clinical and non- clinical studies that functional and durable replacement of COL7 protein is necessary and sufficient to correct the debilitating skin disease that inflicts these patients. 
 The persistence of KB103 in the skin depends on the rate of turnover of the cells where it resides. The vector has been engineered to be able to evade the host immune response and persist for the life of the cell. Additionally, we have also optimized its design to be safe and nontoxic to both dividing and non-dividing cells so that it can be reapplied as often as required. 
 Beyond the advantages surrounding the mechanism of action of KB103, it also has practical advantages as a therapy over autologous approaches. We believe that the major drawbacks of autologous therapies are subject discomfort during administration, a need for highly trained dermatologists, and a high cost of treatment including anesthesia, sophisticated equipment, and possible hospitalization. Additionally, because autologous treatments require time-consuming processing of a patient’s own cells and tissues, there can be a significant lag of six months or more between diagnosis and commencement of 
 9

treatment. As a result, we believe an off-the-shelf, non-invasive treatment such as KB103 will, if successful, be an effective alternative for treating DEB. 
 
KB105 for the treatment of Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyosis (ARCI) associated with TGM1
 Our second product candidate, KB105, is targeting patients with transglutaminase 1, or TGM-1, deficient autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, or ARCI. On August 7, 2018, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to KB105, which is currently in preclinical development for treatment. There are currently no treatments for this disease that affects approximately 20,000 patients worldwide. We anticipate filing an IND application in the first half of 2019. TGM-1 is an essential epidermal enzyme that facilitates the formation of the epidermal barrier, which prevents dehydration, and protects the skin from unwanted toxins and surface microorganisms. The loss of TGM-1-activity results in the severe genetic skin disease ARCI. Most patients with a TGM-1-deficiency exhibit life-long pronounced scaling with increased transepidermal water loss. The scales are plate-like, often of a dark color, and cover the whole-body surface area. TGM-1-deficient ARCI is associated with increased mortality in the neonatal period and has a dramatic impact on quality of life. KB105 is a replication-defective, non-integrating viral vector that has been engineered employing Krystal’s STAR-D platform to deliver functional human TGM-1 gene directly to the patients’ dividing and non-dividing skin cells. HSV-1 is Krystal’s replication-deficient, non-integrating viral vector that can penetrate skin cells more efficiently than other viral vectors. Its high payload capacity allows it to accommodate large or multiple genes and its low immunogenicity makes it a suitable choice for direct and repeat delivery to the skin. 
 
Future Opportunities 
 We believe our focus on the unique properties of dermatological diseases provides efficiencies as we select and pursue additional diseases associated with the skin. We intend to apply our gene therapy technology and specifically the STAR-D platform, across rare skin diseases, such as DEB and ARCI, broad indications, such as atopic dermatitis and chronic wounds, and aesthetic skin conditions, such as wrinkes and nasolabial folds. 
 Our vision is to become a fully integrated biotechnology company with respect to rare skin diseases and work with collaborators on broad indications and aesthetic skin conditions.  We maintain full global rights to all of our product candidates.
 
Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. In particular, the field of gene therapy is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development organizations. In addition, our experience in clinical trials, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, manufacturing and commercialization of products may be more limited. At this time, there is no FDA- or EMA-approved treatment for EB. 
Epidermolysis Bullosa
 A number of companies are developing drug candidates for EB. At this time, there is no FDA- or EMA-approved treatment for DEB. We believe our competitors fall into three broad categories: 

• | Autologous Approaches: We are aware of two companies, Abeona and Fibrocell who are developing autologous or grafting gene therapy approaches to treating DEB.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Palliative Treatments: We are aware of companies such as Castle Creek Pharma who are developing product candidates taking a palliative approach to treating the disease.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-Gene Therapy: We are aware that ProQR Therapeutics has a product candidate in clinical development that intends to treat a subset of genetic defects that cause RDEB with a topical RNA-based treatment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyosis (ARCI)
 We are aware of companies like Novartis and Patagonia Pharmaceuticals who have conducted clinical trials for ARCI in the past, we are unaware of any companies conducting active clinical trials in ARCI presently.

Intellectual Property 
 Krystal recognizes that a comprehensive intellectual property portfolio is essential to our business, can be of substantial value, and supports our drug development programs. We have created, devised, and executed a sophisticated IP strategy in order to develop a cost-effective and wide-ranging patent portfolio, including seeking patent protection in the United States and in other important jurisdictions for our inventions and discoveries. In addition, we diligently develop, maintain, and protect our key know-how, technological advances, and trade secrets relating to our core platform technology, products, and manufacturing and purification processes.
 
We have adopted a strategy of seeking patent protection in the United States and in other jurisdictions globally that we deem appropriate with respect to certain of our technologies relating to our products and processes. On January 16, 2018 we announced that the USPTO had granted U.S. Patent No. 9,877,990 which covers compositions comprising HSV vectors encoding certain effectors and methods of using the same for providing prophylactic, palliative or therapeutic relief of a wound, disorder or disease of the skin. A corresponding international patent application has been filed in accordance with the Paris Cooperation Treaty, and has entered into the national phase in more than ten foreign jurisdictions. In addition, on December 18, 2018 the USPTO granted U.S. Patent No. 10,155,016 which covers compositions containing our first product, KB103, formulated for myriad routes of administration. We are currently seeking patent protection for key aspects of our viral platform technologies through a pending patent application on file at the USPTO. We believe that the granting of these patents, that are 100% owned by the Company, protects our core STAR-D viral platform and products based thereupon, and affords us freedom to use this platform for the development of novel therapeutics for multiple applications. We continue to actively advance our IP portfolio through the filing of new patent applications, divisionals and continuations relating to our technologies as we deem appropriate.
 
In addition to our patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position; however, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, and obtain and maintain ownership of certain technologies, in part, through confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets, and know-how, including by implementing measures intended to maintain the physical and electronic security of our research and manufacturing facilities, as well as our information technology systems.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biologic products including gene therapy products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and regulations and guidance implementing these laws. The FDCA, PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologic products. Applications to the FDA are required before conducting human clinical testing of biologic products. Additionally, each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product candidate is reviewed by the FDA, and in limited instances the National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, through its Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biologic products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates. 
 Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is in the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, or the OCTGT, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee, or the CTGTAC, to advise CBER on its reviews. CBER works closely with the NIH and the RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. To date, we are aware of only two gene therapy products, Novartis’ Kymriah and Spark Therapeutics’s Luxurna, that have received marketing approval by the FDA. The FDA has provided guidance for the development of gene therapy products generally, including a growing body of guidance documents on chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC, clinical investigations and other areas of gene therapy development, all of which are intended to facilitate the industry’s development of gene therapy products. 
 Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that 
 11

our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 U.S. Biologic Products Development Process 
 The FDA must approve a product candidate before it may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which allows human clinical trials to begin unless FDA objects within 30 days;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by each clinical trial site’s institutional review board (“IRB”) and institutional biosafety committee (“IBC”) before the clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s GCP regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with c requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, including a gene therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal studies of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies. 
 12

Human Clinical Trials Under an IND 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators which generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB and IBC at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or their legal representative, reviews and approves the study protocol, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials involving recombinant DNA also must be reviewed by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research that utilizes recombinant DNA at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 
 Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The biologic product candidate initially is introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. Phase 1 clinical trials of gene therapies are typically conducted in patients rather than healthy volunteers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes studies that present the data the FDA or other relevant regulatory agencies will use to determine whether or not to approve a biologic product. In Phase 3 studies, the biologic product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the potency and safety of the product for approval. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. 
 Additional Regulation for Gene Therapy Clinical Trials 
 In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic 
 13

Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene therapy trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 The results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s CMC and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. For gene therapies, selecting patients with applicable genetic defects is a necessary condition to effective treatment. For the therapy we are currently developing, we believe that diagnoses based on existing genetic tests developed and administered by laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, are sufficient to select appropriate patients and will be permitted by the FDA. Under the PDUFA, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. The PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biologics and an annual establishment license fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before it accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In that event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the product candidate. 
 REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. 
 On the basis of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. 
 If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such goal is to review standard BLAs in 10 months after the FDA accepts the BLA for filing, and priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a 
 14

review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 On November 2, 2017, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to the Company’s lead product candidate, KB103, for the treatment of DEB. On August 7, 2018, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to the Company’s second product candidate, KB105 which is currently in preclinical development for treatment of patients with TGM-1 or ARCI.
 The FDA’s Office of Orphan Drug Products grants orphan drug designation to support the development of medicines for underserved patient populations, or rare disorders, that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan drug designation may allow Krystal Biotech to be eligible for a seven-year period of U.S. marketing exclusivity upon approval of KB103, tax credits for certain clinical research costs, and a waiver of the PDUFA filing fees, subject to certain conditions. 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a biologic product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biologic product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if the party holding the exclusivity fails to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. 
 Orphan medicinal product status in the EU has similar, but not identical, benefits. On April 16, 2018, the EMA granted the orphan medicinal product designation, or OMPD, for KB103. KB103 has the distinction of being the first investigational HSV-1 based gene therapy for DEB to receive this designation.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 In addition, the FDA is authorized to expedite the review of BLAs in several ways. 
 Fast Track Program 
 Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a biologic product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Biologic products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review. Any product submitted to FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval. 
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation
To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and rolling review. 
 15

Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) Designation
To qualify for the RMAT program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates have the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The designation gives the sponsor access to increased meeting opportunities with FDA, in a manner comparable to those offered to sponsors of breakthrough-designated therapies. Because the designated products meet the criteria for unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious condition, they may be eligible for priority review, in which the initial assessment of the BLA is reduced from ten months to six months, and accelerated approval, which bases approval on an effect on a predictive surrogate endpoint or an intermediate clinical endpoint. RMATs qualifying for accelerated approval may be able to satisfy licensing requirements through commitment to post-approval clinical studies as well as real-world data such as patient registries and health record analysis.
 Accelerated Approval
Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials. 
 Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher 
 The FDA also offers a rare pediatric disease drug designation. If a drug receives the designation of a “rare pediatric disease” drug, it is eligible during the FDA marketing process to apply for a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher. According to the FDA website, under the Rare Pediatric Priority Review Voucher Program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a “rare pediatric disease” may qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. In December 2016, we received the designation of “rare pediatric disease” for KB103 and conditional designation of our marketing application as a “rare pediatric disease product application,” which, if granted, could qualify us to receive a Rare Pediatric Priority Review Voucher. According to the FDA website, a Rare Pediatric Priority Review Voucher can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biologic products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biologic products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product; recordkeeping requirements; reporting of adverse effects; reporting updated safety and efficacy information; and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA, together with a release protocol, showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biologic products. A sponsor also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”). 
 Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 16


U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of product candidates, some of a sponsor’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period generally is one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biologic product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. Moreover, a given patent may only be extended once based on a single product. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. 
Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, sponsors are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of biologic products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
 Whether or not a sponsor obtains FDA approval for a product, a sponsor must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, much like the IND, prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a request for a Clinical Trial Authorization, or CTA, must be submitted to the competent regulatory authorities and the competent Ethics Committees in the EU Member States in which the clinical trial takes place, much like FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA request is approved in accordance with the EU and the EU Member State’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. The requirements and processes governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, as well as the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki (whichever provides the greater protection to the clinical trial participants). 
 Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, fines; suspension, variation or withdrawal of regulatory approvals; product recalls; seizure of products; operating restrictions; and criminal prosecution. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations 
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and use of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors, existing or potential customers and referral sources are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, and these laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which manufacturers market, sell and distribute the products for which they obtain marketing approval. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation;

• | the federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, or the FCA, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, also may implicate the FCA. In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA;

• | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or the CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, certain other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations, which imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the transmission, security and privacy of protected health information;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Violation of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and imprisonment. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any product candidates for which regulatory approval for commercial sale is obtained will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities and health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. EU member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.

Health Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, for example, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected and continues to face major uncertainty due to the status of major legislative initiatives surrounding healthcare reform.  
Additional Regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other countries that impose similar obligations. 
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business abroad or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other foreign countries that impose similar obligations. 
Employees 
 As of February 28, 2019, we had thirty seven employees, primarily engaged in research and development activities and manufacturing activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good. 
Corporate Information 
 We commenced operations on April 15, 2016. On March 31, 2017, we converted from a California limited liability company to a Delaware C-corporation, and changed our name from Krystal Biotech, LLC to Krystal Biotech, Inc. Our principal offices are located at 2100 Wharton Street, Suite 701, Pittsburgh, PA 15203, and our telephone number is 412-586-5830. Our website address is www.krystalbio.com. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the website will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and are not considered part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should not rely on any such information in making your decision whether to purchase our common stock. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, are available free of charge on our investor relations website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. The SEC also maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding the Company that we file electronically with the SEC.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 
 We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As a smaller reporting company and an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of relief from certain reporting requirements and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

• | Reduced obligations with respect to financial data, including presenting only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of selected financial data in this Form 10-K;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | An exception from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19

We may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years or such earlier time that we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, have more than $700 million in market value of our capital stock held by non-affiliates or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced reporting burdens. For example, we intend to take advantage of the reduced reporting requirements with respect to disclosure regarding our executive compensation arrangements, have presented only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and have taken advantage of the exemption from auditor attestation on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. To the extent that we take advantage of these reduced reporting burdens, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than you might obtain from other public companies in which you hold equity interests.
 In addition, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to adopt this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
