ITEM 1.             BUSINESS
Overview
CarParts.com, Inc. is a leading online provider of aftermarket auto parts and accessories. Our mission is to provide an easy online shopping experience to help customers get back on the road quickly.
We principally sell our products, identified as stock keeping units (“SKUs”), to individual consumers through our flagship website at www.carparts.com and online marketplaces. Our user-friendly website, and mobile-friendly platform, provide customers with a comprehensive selection of over 913,000 SKUs with detailed product descriptions, attributes and photographs. We have developed a proprietary product database that maps our SKUs to product applications based on vehicle makes, models and years to help ensure the right part for each specific vehicle is provided. Our online sales channel and relationships with suppliers enable us to eliminate intermediaries in the traditional auto parts supply chain and to offer a broader selection of SKUs than can easily be offered by offline retailer competition.
We were incorporated in California in 1995 as a distributor of aftermarket auto parts and launched our first website in 2000. We reincorporated in Delaware in 2006 and expanded our online operations, increasing the number of SKUs sold through our e-commerce network, adding additional websites, improving our internet marketing proficiency, and commencing sales on online marketplaces. 
In July of 2020, we changed the name of our company to CarParts.com, Inc. as we consolidated our network of websites into one e-commerce flagship website, www.carparts.com. In January of 2021, we launched the first electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid focused online shopping hub at www.carparts.com/ev.
Our vision of “Empowering Drivers Along Their Journey” focuses on creating a trusted platform that takes the stress out of vehicle repair and maintenance.  We believe our strategy consists of four areas of focus: outstanding customer service, operational excellence, financial discipline, and innovation. 
Outstanding Customer Service means delivering an extensive assortment of competitively priced, quality parts to drivers looking for simple, stress-free vehicle care in an unparalleled digital-first experience.  We accomplish this by leveraging our vertically integrated supply chain, expanding our domestic footprint to get closer to the customer, and improving our website and user experience. 
Operational Excellence means creating a culture of continuous improvement.  We focus on optimizing processes, eliminating bottlenecks, and improving communication and collaboration within our organization.  This requires a commitment to ongoing learning and development as well as embracing new technologies and processes.
Financial Discipline means optimizing costs and managing financial resources in a prudent and responsible manner in order to drive shareholder value.  At an organizational level, our goal is to optimize cash flow, control costs, and allocate resources effectively. 
Innovation means ensuring that our company continues to evolve and deliver products and services that meet our customers evolving needs.  There are currently products and services that are not widely available to customers that we believe are areas of opportunity. With meticulous execution, these innovations have the chance to build more value for our shoppers while creating additional revenues or profits in the future.  
Our corporate website is located at www.carparts.com/investor.
We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, ending on the Saturday nearest the end of December. References to 2022, 2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the 52-week fiscal year ended January 1, 2022, and the 53-week fiscal year ended January 2, 2021, respectively.

Our Products
We offer a broad selection of aftermarket auto parts. We continually refine our product offering by introducing new brands and parts categories, while discontinuing low-selling brands and SKUs. We broadly classify our products into three subcategories by function: replacement parts serving the wear and tear and body repair market, hard parts to serve the maintenance and repair market, and performance parts and accessories.
Replacement Parts. The replacement parts category is primarily comprised of parts for the exterior of an automobile. Our parts in this category are typically replacement parts for original body parts that have been damaged as a result of a collision or through general wear and tear. In addition, we sell an extensive line of mirror products, including one of our own house brands called Kool-Vue®, which are marketed and sold as aftermarket replacement parts and as upgrades to existing parts.
Hard Parts. The hard parts category is comprised of engine and chassis components as well as other mechanical and electrical parts, including one of our own house brands of aftermarket catalytic converters called Evan Fischer®. These parts serve as replacement parts for existing engine parts and are generally used by professionals and do-it-yourselfers for engine and mechanical maintenance and repair.
Performance Parts and Accessories. We offer performance versions of many parts sold in each of the above categories, including parts from one of our own house brands, JC Whitney®. Performance parts and accessories generally consist of parts that enhance the performance of the automobile, upgrade existing functionality of a specific part or improve the physical appearance or comfort of the automobile.
Our Sales Channels
Our sales channels include the online channel and the offline channel.
Online Sales Channel. Our online sales channel primarily consists of our flagship e-commerce website www.carparts.com. We also sell our products through online marketplaces, including third-party auction sites and shopping portals, which provide us with access to additional consumer segments. The majority of our online sales are to individual consumers.
Offline Sales Channel. We market our products nationwide to auto parts wholesale distributors. 
Our Fulfillment Operations
We fulfill customer orders using two primary methods: (1) stock-and-ship, where we take physical delivery of merchandise and store it in one of our distribution centers until it is shipped to a customer, and (2) drop-ship, where merchandise is shipped directly to customers from our suppliers. We believe that the flexibility of fulfilling orders using two different fulfillment methods allows us to offer a broader product selection, helps optimize product inventory and enhances our overall business profitability.
Stock-and-Ship Fulfillment. Our stock-and-ship products are sourced primarily from manufacturers and other suppliers located in Asia, Europe, Mexico, the United States, as well as various other countries, and are stored in one of our distribution centers located in Virginia, Illinois, Nevada, Texas or Florida. We also use temporary outside storage and third-party logistics partners from time to time. All products received into our distribution centers are entered into our inventory management systems, allowing us to closely monitor inventory availability. We consider a number of factors in determining which items to stock in our distribution centers, including which products can be purchased at a meaningful discount to domestic prices for similar items, which products have historically sold in high volumes, and which products may be out of stock when we attempt to fulfill via drop-ship.
Drop-Ship Fulfillment. We have developed relationships with several United States-based auto parts distributors that operate their own distribution centers and can deliver products directly to our customers. We internally developed a

proprietary distributor selection system, Auto-Vend™, which allows us to electronically select multiple vendors for a given order. Auto-Vend™ will attempt to first direct an order to one of our warehouses. If the product is not in stock, Auto-Vend™ will process the order to the next appropriate vendor based on customer location, cost, contractual agreements, and service level history.
Suppliers
We source our products from two primary regions: (1) our house brands product sourced primarily through manufacturers and distributors in the Asia-Pacific region, and (2) our branded product sourced primarily through drop-ship manufacturers and distributors located in the United States.
House Brands Product. Our house brands suppliers offer products which are generally less expensive and we believe provide better value for our consumers. As a result, our mix shift towards house brands product has continued to increase on a year-over-year basis. We stock-and-ship our house brands products in our distribution centers. We currently have over 70,000 house brands SKUs in our product selection.
Branded Product. Serving as a stocking distributor for many branded products, we have developed and implemented application programming interfaces with the majority of our branded, drop ship suppliers that allow us to electronically transmit orders, check inventory availability, and receive the shipment tracking information which is easily passed on to our customers. In addition, we are a significant customer for many of our drop-ship vendors and have long standing relationships and contracts with many of these suppliers. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, three of our drop-ship vendors accounted for approximately 9% of our total product purchases. We currently have over 843,000 branded SKUs in our product selection.
Marketing
Our online marketing efforts are primarily designed to attract visitors to www.carparts.com, convert visitors into purchasing customers and encourage repeat purchases among our existing customer base. We use a variety of marketing methods, including online marketing methods to attract visitors, which include paid search advertising, search engine optimization, affiliate programs, e-mail marketing and inclusion in online shopping engines. To convert visitors into paying customers, we periodically run promotions for discounted products. We seek to create cross-selling opportunities by displaying complementary and related products available for sale throughout the purchasing process, including bundled kits and sets. We utilize several marketing techniques, including targeted e-mails about specific vehicle promotions, to increase customer awareness of our products.
International Operations
In April 2007, we established offshore operations in the Philippines. Our offshore operations allow us to access a workforce with the necessary technical skills at a significantly lower cost than comparably experienced U.S.-based professionals. Our offshore operations are responsible for a majority of our website development, catalog management, and back office support. Our offshore operations also house our main call center. We also primarily source our house brands product from suppliers in the Asia-Pacific region.

Competition
The auto repair information and parts industry is competitive and highly fragmented, with products distributed through multi-tiered and overlapping channels. We compete with both online and offline retailers who offer original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”), aftermarket and private label parts to either the Do-It-Yourself (“DIY”) or Do-It-For-Me (“DIFM”) customer segments. Current or potential competitors include the following:

● | national auto parts retailers such as Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone, Napa Auto Parts, CarQuest, O’Reilly Automotive and Pep Boys;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | large online marketplaces such as Amazon.com (“Amazon”) and sellers on eBay;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other online retailers of automotive products and auto repair information websites;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | local independent retailers or niche auto parts retailers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | wholesale aftermarket auto parts distributors such as LKQ Corporation; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | manufacturers, brand suppliers and other distributors selling online directly to consumers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe the principal competitive factors in our market are helping customers easily find their parts, educating consumers on the service and maintenance of their vehicles, maintaining a proprietary product catalog that maps individual parts to relevant vehicle applications, broad product selection and availability, price, knowledgeable customer service, rapid order fulfillment and delivery, and easy product returns. We believe we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. However, some of our competitors may be larger, may have stronger brand recognition or may have access to greater financial, technical and marketing resources or may have been operating longer than we have. 
Human Capital
 Our ability to recruit, retain, and develop our employees is key to our long-term growth and success. As of December 31, 2022, we had 976 employees in the United States and 556 employees in the Philippines for a total of 1,532 employees. Additionally, we rely on independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider employee relations to be good.
 Diversity and Inclusion
 We strive to build and create a culture where each person feels valued, respected and understood. As of December 31, 2022, the makeup of our employees consisted of 39% women and approximately 82% non-white. 
 Employee Engagement
 We value employee feedback and are committed to collecting regular feedback primarily through employee surveys. In addition, we believe that offering training and career growth opportunities is valuable for employee engagement and we often have promoted current employees to higher level positions. We also provide competitive compensation and benefits programs that we believe meet the needs of our employees. 
 Health and Safety 
 We have implemented, and continue to implement, policies that provide for the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We are committed to operating in a safe workplace, and have established safety procedures and safety programs at our distribution centers. During the heighted risk times of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety modifications at all workforce locations and provided enhanced safety measures to safeguard our employees at our distribution centers.

Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property, including trademarks, service marks, domain names, patents, copyrights and trade secrets, is an important part of our business. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of laws and regulations, in addition to intellectual property rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, including trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret laws, together with contractual provisions and technical measures that we have implemented. To protect our trade secrets, we maintain strict control access to our proprietary systems and technology, including our platforms and infrastructure environments. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with third parties that provide products and services to us. 
We have current and pending trademarks registered in the United States, including Carparts.com®, Kool-Vue®, JC Whitney®, Evan Fischer®, SureStop®, TrueDrive®, DriveWire™, and DriveMotive™, amongst others, and we have additional trademark applications pending in the United States and other jurisdictions. 
​
Government Regulation
We are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and the handling of customer complaints and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. The growth and demand for online commerce has and may continue to result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on online companies. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, spyware and the tracking of consumer activities, marketing e-mails and communications, other advertising and promotional practices, money transfers, pricing, product safety, content and quality of products and services, taxation, electronic contracts and other communications and information security. In addition, most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket auto parts in collision repair work and/or require enhanced disclosure or vehicle owner consent before using aftermarket auto parts in such repair work and additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future.
There is also great uncertainty over whether or how existing laws governing issues such as sales and other taxes, auctions, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet and commercial online services. These issues may take years to resolve. For example, tax authorities in a number of states, as well as a Congressional advisory commission, are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce, and new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and commercial online services could result in significant additional taxes or regulatory restrictions on our business. These taxes or restrictions could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and overall financial condition. Furthermore, there is a possibility that we may be subject to significant fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements.
Seasonality
We believe our business is somewhat seasonal in nature.  It includes many categories, geographies, and channels which may experience seasonality from time to time based on various external factors. Additionally, seasonality may affect our product mix. These historical seasonality trends could continue, and such trends may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations in subsequent periods.
