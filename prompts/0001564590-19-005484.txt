Item 1. Business 
General 
 References to “Easterly,” “we,” “our,” “us” and “our company” refer to Easterly Government Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with our consolidated subsidiaries including Easterly Government Properties LP, a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to herein as our operating partnership. 
 We are an internally managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, focused primarily on the acquisition, development and management of Class A commercial properties that are leased to U.S. Government agencies that serve essential functions. We generate substantially all of our revenue by leasing our properties to such agencies either directly or through the U.S. General Services Administration, which we refer to herein as the GSA. Our objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over the long term through dividends and capital appreciation. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we 
wholly owned 62 operating properties in the United States that are 100% leased, including 60 operating properties that are leased primarily to U.S. Government tenant agencies and two operating properties that are entirely leased to private tenants, encompassing approximately 5.3 million square feet in the aggregate. In addition, we wholly owned two properties under development that we expect will encompass approximately 0.1 million square feet upon completion. We focus on acquiring, developing and managing U.S. Government-leased properties that are essential to supporting the mission of the tenant agency and strive to be a partner of choice for the U.S. Government, working with the tenant agency to meet its needs and objectives. 
 Our operating partnership holds substantially all of our assets and conducts substantially all of our business. We are the sole general partner of and own approximately 87.2% of the aggregate operating partnership units in our operating partnership. We believe that we have operated and have been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for U.S.
 federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2015.
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that we distinguish ourselves from other owners and operators of office and other commercial properties, including properties leased to the U.S. Government, through the following competitive strengths: 

• | High Quality Portfolio Leased to Mission-Critical U.S. Government Agencies. We focus primarily on the acquisition, development and management of Class A commercial properties that are leased to U.S. Government agencies that serve mission-critical functions and are of high importance within the hierarchy of these agencies. These properties generally meet our investment criteria, which target major federal buildings of Class A construction that are less than 20 years old, are at least 85% leased to a single U.S. Government agency, are in excess of 40,000 rentable square feet with expansion potential, are in strategic locations to facilitate the tenant agency’s mission, include build-to-suit features and are focused on environmental sustainability. As of December 31, 2018, the weighted average age of our operating properties was approximately 12.5 years based on the date the property was built or renovated-to-suit, where applicable, and the weighted average remaining lease term was approximately 7.6 years.

• | U.S. Government Tenant Base with Strong History of Renewal. Our leases with U.S. Government agencies are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. For the GSA leases, rents are paid from the Federal Buildings Fund and are not subject to direct federal appropriations. All of our leases with other federal agencies were executed under delegation from GSA, and therefore the Federal Buildings Fund stands behind these leases as a guarantor, even though the rent is paid from appropriated funds by the agencies who executed the lease contracts. Furthermore, the U.S. Government has never experienced a financial default to date. In addition to stable rent payments, our U.S. Government leases typically have initial total terms of ten to 20 years with renewal leases having terms of five to 15 years. U.S. Government leases governing properties similar to the properties that we target have historically had high renewal rates, which limit operational risk. We believe that the strong credit quality of our U.S. Government tenant base, our long-term leases, the likelihood of lease renewal and the high tenant recovery rate for our property-related operating expenses contribute to the stability of our operating cash flows and expected distributions.

• | Experienced and Aligned Management Team. Our senior management team has a proven track record of sourcing, acquiring, developing and managing properties leased to U.S. Government agencies. Collectively, our senior management team has been responsible for the acquisition of an aggregate of approximately 4.5 million square feet of U.S. Government-leased properties and the development of approximately 1.3 million aggregate square feet of such properties. We believe that our management expertise provides us with a significant advantage over our competitors when pursuing acquisition opportunities and engaging U.S. Government agencies in property development opportunities and provides us with superior property management and tenant service capabilities.

• | Access to Acquisition Opportunities with an Active Pipeline. Our senior management team has an extensive network of longstanding relationships with owners, specialized developers, leasing brokers, lenders and other participants in the U.S. Government-leased property market. Our team seeks to leverage these relationships to access a wide variety of sourcing opportunities, frequently resulting in the acquisition of properties that were not broadly marketed. In addition, we maintain a proprietary database that tracks approximately 8,100 leases totaling approximately 188 million rentable square feet and includes substantially every major U.S. Government-leased property that meets our investment criteria as well as information about the ownership of such properties. We believe that our longstanding industry relationships, coupled with our proprietary database, improve our ability to source and execute attractive acquisition opportunities. Further, these factors enable us to effectively initiate transactions with property owners who may not currently be seeking to sell their property, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage over others bidding in broadly marketed transactions.

• | Extensive Development Experience with U.S. Government-Leased Properties. Our senior management team has developed projects comprising approximately 4.4 million square feet, including 38 build-to-suit projects for the U.S. Government as well as other corporate tenants. In the aggregate, our senior management team has developed 21 projects for the GSA and U.S. Government agencies. Development of government projects, particularly build-to-suit projects, requires expertise in GSA and other U.S. Government requirements and the needs of tenant agencies. Since 1994, members of our senior management team have developed an average of approximately 51,905 square feet per year of U.S. Government-leased build-to-suit properties. We believe that our thorough understanding of the U.S. Government’s procurement processes and standards, our longstanding relationships with the GSA and other agencies of the U.S. Government, and our differentiated capabilities enables us to continue to compete effectively for U.S. Government development opportunities.

• | Value-Enhancing Asset Management. Our management team focuses on the efficient management of our properties and on improvements to our properties that enhance their value for a tenant agency and improve the likelihood of lease renewal. We work in close partnership with the U.S. Government tenant agencies to manage the construction of specialized, agency-specific design enhancements. These highly tailored build-outs substantially increase the likelihood of the tenant agency’s renewal and also typically generate a construction management fee paid by the tenant agency to us in the amount of approximately 14% of the actual cost of construction. We also seek to reduce operating costs at all of our properties, often by implementing environmentally-driven energy efficiency programs that help the U.S. Government achieve its conservation and efficiency goals. Our asset management team also conducts frequent audits of each of our properties in concert with the U.S. Government tenant agency to keep each facility in optimal condition, allow the tenant agency to better perform its stated mission and help to position us as a partner of choice for the U.S. Government and its tenant agencies.

• | Growth-Oriented Capital Structure. Our capital structure provides us with the resources, financial flexibility and the capacity to support the future growth of our business. Since our initial public offering, we have raised capital through three public offerings of our common stock and through sales of common stock under our at-the-market equity offering program, which we refer to as our ATM program. As of December 31, 2018, we had sold $67.7 million of our common stock under our ATM program, leaving us with the capacity to issue up to $32.3 million of additional shares. As of December 31, 2018, we had total indebtedness of approximately $770.9 million, including borrowings of approximately $134.8 million outstanding under our $450 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which we refer to as our revolving credit facility, for a net debt to total enterprise value of 41.1%. None of our outstanding indebtedness is scheduled to mature until 2022.

Business & Growth Strategies 
 Our objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over the long term through dividends and capital appreciation. We pursue the following strategies to achieve these goals: 

• | Pursue attractive acquisition opportunities. We seek to pursue strategic and disciplined acquisitions of properties that we believe are essential to the mission of select U.S. Government agencies and that, in many cases, contain agency-specific design enhancements that allow each tenant agency to better satisfy its mission. We target for acquisition primarily major federal buildings of Class A construction that are less than 20 years old, are at least 85% leased to a single U.S. Government agency, are in excess of 40,000 rentable square feet with expansion potential, are in strategic locations to facilitate the tenant agency’s mission, include build-to-suit features and are focused on environmental sustainability.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop Build-to-Suit U.S. Government Properties. We target attractive opportunities to develop build-to-suit properties for use by certain U.S. Government agencies. As U.S. Government agencies expand, they often require additional space tailored specifically to their needs, which may not be available in the agency’s target market and therefore require new construction. The U.S. Government typically solicits proposals from private companies to develop and lease such properties to the agency, rather than developing and owning the property itself. We expect to bid for those property

development opportunities published by the GSA or the relevant U.S. Government agency that suit our investment criteria.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Renew Existing Leases at Positive Spreads. We seek to renew leases at our U.S. Government-leased properties at positive spreads upon expiration. Upon lease renewal, U.S. Government rental rates are typically reset based on a number of factors, including inflation, the replacement cost of the building at the time of renewal and enhancements to the property since the date of the prior lease. During the term of a U.S. Government lease, we work in close partnership with the tenant agency to implement improvements at our properties to enhance the U.S. Government tenant agency’s ability to perform its stated mission, thereby increasing the importance of the building to the tenant agency and the probability of an increase in rent upon lease renewal.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduce Property-Level Operating Expenses. We manage our properties with a focus on increasing our income by continuing to reduce property-level operating costs and identifying cost efficiencies so as to eliminate any excess spending and streamline our operating costs. When we acquire a property, we review all property-level operating expenditures to determine whether and how the property can be managed more efficiently.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018 we had 32 employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. 
Significant Tenants 
 Substantially all of our current rents come from U.S. Government tenant agencies. As of December 31, 2018, our U.S. Government tenant agencies accounted for 98.8% of our annualized lease income. For further information on the composition of our tenant base, see “Item 2. Properties.” 
Insurance 
 We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on all of our properties, with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement-cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. The majority of our property policies include coverage for the perils of flood and earthquake shock with limits and deductibles customary in the industry and specific to the property. We also generally obtain title insurance policies when acquiring new properties, which insure fee title to our real properties. We currently have coverage for losses incurred in connection with both domestic and foreign terrorist-related activities. While we do carry commercial general liability insurance, property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our properties, these policies include limits and terms we consider commercially reasonable. There are certain losses that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in our belief, economically impractical to maintain such coverage. Should an uninsured loss arise against us, we would be required to use our own funds to resolve the issue, including litigation costs. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in the opinion of our management, the properties in our portfolio are adequately insured. 
Competition 
 We compete with numerous developers, real estate companies and other owners of commercial properties for acquisitions and pursuing buyers for dispositions. We expect that other real estate investors, including insurance companies, private equity funds, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, other REITs and other well-capitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. In addition, U.S. Government tenants are viewed as desirable tenants by other landlords because of their strong credit profile, and properties leased to U.S. Government tenant agencies often attract many potential buyers. This competition could increase prices for properties of the type we may pursue and adversely affect our profitability and impede our growth. In addition, substantially all of our properties face competition for tenants. Some competing properties may be newer, better located or more attractive to tenants. Competing properties may have lower rates of occupancy than our properties, which may result in competing owners offering available space at lower rents than we offer at our properties. This competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants, may reduce the rents we are able to charge and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Regulation 
 Environmental and Related Matters 
 Under various federal, state or local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or release of hazardous substances, waste, or petroleum products at, on, in, under or from such property, including costs for investigation or remediation, natural resource damages, or third-party liability for personal injury or property damage. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such materials, and the liability may be joint and several. Some of our properties may be impacted by contamination arising from current or prior uses of the property or adjacent properties for commercial, industrial or other purposes. Such contamination may arise from spills of petroleum or hazardous substances or releases from tanks used to store such materials. We also may be liable for the costs of remediating contamination at off-site disposal or treatment facilities when we arrange for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at such facilities, without regard to whether we comply with environmental laws in doing so. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination on our properties may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants and our ability to develop or sell or borrow against those properties. 
 In addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Noncompliance with these environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject us or our tenants to liability. These liabilities could affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us. Moreover, changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with such laws and regulations or increase liability for noncompliance. This may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations, or those of our tenants, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on us. We sometimes require our private tenants to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities in our leases with them. But in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of any of our tenants to satisfy such obligations, we may be required to satisfy such obligations. We are not presently aware of any instances of material noncompliance with environmental or health and safety laws or regulations at our properties, and we believe that we and/or our tenants have all material permits and approvals necessary under current laws and regulations to operate our properties. 
 With respect to properties we develop or may in the future develop, we may be subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction and similar matters, including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning requirements. In addition, we will be subject to registration and filing requirements in connection with these developments in certain states and localities in which we operate even if all necessary U.S. Government approvals have been obtained. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing properties due to building moratoriums that could be implemented in the future in certain states in which we intend to operate. 
 Americans with Disabilities Act 
 Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA, to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe the existing properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect. 
Corporate Responsibility
 We are committed to sustainability and continually seek to improve our environmental and social responsibility initiatives, efforts, programs and policies. We have an in-house team that meets regularly to identify, initiate and monitor sustainable practices in all aspects of our business for the benefit of our tenants, shareholders, employees and the community at large.  The U.S. Government serves as the natural partner for our environmentally-friendly endeavors. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the U.S. Government maintains “green lease” policies that include the “Promotion of Energy Efficiency and Use of Renewable Energy” as one of the factors it considers when leasing property.  The U.S. Government’s “green lease” initiative permits U.S. Government tenants to require LEED-CI certification in selecting new premises or renewing leases at existing premises. There are currently 15 properties in our portfolio that have achieved a total of 16 LEED certifications. 
 We are also committed to volunteerism, philanthropy and striving to make a positive impact on the communities in which we conduct business, which we believe mutually benefits our tenants, investors, employees and the communities in which we operate. We endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the resources and opportunities to succeed. We have a commitment to diversity in all of its forms and strive to promote and maintain a work environment where all employees are treated

with dignity and respect, offered opportunities for professional development and valued for their unique contributions to the Company's success. 
 REIT Qualification 
 We believe that we have operated and have been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2015.
 So long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on net taxable income that we distribute annually to our stockholders. In order to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the real estate qualification of sources of our income, the composition and values of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the diversity of ownership of our stock. In order to comply with REIT requirements, we may need to forego otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities and the manner in which we conduct our operations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” 
 Supplemental U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
 The following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the prospectus dated March 16, 2018 contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on March 16, 2018.  This summary is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice.  This discussion does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders of our securities in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances.
Consolidated Appropriations Act
 The Consolidated Appropriations Act (“CAA”) was signed into law on March 23, 2018.  The CAA amended various provisions of the Code and implicates certain tax-related disclosures contained in the prospectus. As a result, the discussion under “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—Taxation of Stockholders and Potential Tax Consequences of Their Investment in Shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock—Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders” in the second and third full paragraphs on page 47 of the prospectus are replaced with the following paragraphs: 
 For periods on or after December 18, 2015, to the extent our stock is held directly (or indirectly through one or more partnerships) by a “qualified shareholder,” it will not be treated as a USRPI. Further, to the extent such treatment applies, any distribution to such shareholder will not be treated as gain recognized from the sale or exchange of a USRPI. For these purposes, a qualified shareholder is generally a non-U.S. stockholder that (i)(A) is eligible for treaty benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States that includes an exchange of information program, and the principal class of interests of which is listed and regularly traded on one or more stock exchanges as defined by the treaty, or (B) is a foreign limited partnership organized in a jurisdiction with an exchange of information agreement with the United States and that has a class of regularly traded limited partnership units (having a value greater than 50% of the value of all partnership units) on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, (ii) is a “qualified collective investment vehicle” (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3)(B) of the Code) and (iii) maintains records of persons holding 5% or more of the class of interests described in clauses (i)(A) or (i)(B) above. However, in the case of a qualified shareholder having one or more “applicable investors,” the exception described in the first sentence of this paragraph will not apply to the applicable percentage of the qualified shareholder’s stock (with “applicable percentage” generally meaning the percentage of the value of the interests in the qualified shareholder held by applicable investors after applying certain constructive ownership rules). The applicable percentage of the amount realized by a qualified shareholder on the disposition of our stock or with respect to a distribution from us attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI will be treated as amounts realized from the disposition of USRPIs. Such treatment shall also apply to applicable investors in respect of distributions treated as a sale or exchange of stock with respect to a qualified shareholder. For these purposes, an “applicable investor” is a person who generally holds an interest in the qualified shareholder and holds more than 10% of our stock applying certain constructive ownership rules. 
 For periods on or after December 18, 2015, for FIRPTA purposes neither a “qualified foreign pension fund” nor any entity all of the interests of which are held by a qualified foreign pension fund is treated as a non-U.S. stockholder. A “qualified foreign pension fund” is an organization or arrangement (i) created or organized in a foreign country, (ii) established by a foreign country (or one or more political subdivisions thereof) or one or more employers to provide retirement or pension benefits to current or former employees (including self-employed individuals) or their designees as a result of, or in consideration for, services rendered, (iii) which does not have a single participant or beneficiary that has a right to more than 5% of its assets or income, (iv) which is subject to government regulation and with respect to which annual information about its beneficiaries is provided, or is otherwise available, to relevant local tax authorities and (v) with respect to which, under its local laws, (A) contributions that would otherwise be subject to tax are deductible or excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate, or (B) taxation of its investment income is deferred, or such income is excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate.

Recent FATCA Regulations 
 On December 18, 2018, the Internal Revenue Service promulgated proposed regulations under Sections 1471-1474 of the Code (commonly referred to as FATCA), which proposed regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on gross proceeds and thus implicate certain tax-related disclosures contained in the prospectus. As a result, the fourth sentence of the discussion under “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—Taxation of Stockholders and Potential Tax Consequences of Their Investment in Shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock—Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders—FATCA Withholding on Certain Foreign Accounts and Entities” on page 48 of the prospectus is replaced with the following: 
 While withholding under FATCA would have applied after December 31, 2018 to the gross proceeds from a disposition of property that can produce U.S. source interest or dividends, recently proposed Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed Treasury Regulations until final Treasury Regulations are issued. Withholding under FATCA currently applies with respect to other withholding payments (e.g., U.S. source interest and dividends).
