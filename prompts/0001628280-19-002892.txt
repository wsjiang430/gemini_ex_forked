ITEM 1. Business
General
Apyx Medical Corporation (“Company”, “Apyx Medical”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), formerly known as Bovie Medical Corporation, was incorporated in 1982, under the laws of the State of Delaware and has its principal executive office at 5115 Ulmerton Road, Clearwater, FL 33760.
We are a medical technology company and the developer of J-Plasma® (marketed and sold under the Renuvion™ Cosmetic Technology brand in the cosmetic surgery market), a patented plasma-based surgical product for cutting, coagulation and ablation of soft tissue. J-Plasma technology utilizes a helium ionization process to produce a stable, focused beam of plasma that provides surgeons with greater precision, and minimal invasiveness. The Company also leverages its expertise through original equipment manufacturing (OEM) agreements with other medical device manufacturers.
On August 30, 2018, we closed on a definitive asset purchase agreement with Specialty Surgical Instrumentation Inc., a Tennessee Corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Symmetry Surgical Inc. (“Symmetry”), pursuant to which we divested and sold our electrosurgical "Core" business segment and related intellectual property, including the Bovie® brand and trademarks, to Symmetry for gross proceeds of $97 million in cash. The divestiture and sale of our Core business segment to Symmetry allows us to further focus on our strategic objective of commercializing our J-Plasma technology, including the RenuvionTM brand in the cosmetic surgery market. We also entered into with Symmetry a transition services agreement, a Patent Licensing Agreement, a Disposables Supply Agreement, and a Generator Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, the latter of which will establish us as an OEM-provider of generators to Symmetry for a period of at least 10 years.
In connection with the asset purchase agreement, we also entered into an Electro Surgical Disposables and Accessories, Cauteries and Other Products Supply Agreement with Symmetry for up to a four-year term, whereby we will manufacture certain Core products and sell them to Symmetry at agreed upon prices. Any revenue, costs and expenses resulting from this agreement are netted and reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as Other gains or losses.
In connection with the asset purchase agreement, we also entered into a Manufacture and Supply Agreement with Symmetry for a ten-year term, whereby we will manufacture certain products and sell them to Symmetry at agreed upon prices. Revenue, costs and expenses resulting from this agreement are reported in our Consolidated Statements as income or loss from operations of our OEM reporting segment.
As of December 31, 2018, we had a direct sales force of 27 field-based selling professionals and a network of 14 independent sales agencies.  We also had three sales managers.  This selling organization is focused on the use of Renuvion in the cosmetic surgery market. In addition, we have invested in training programs and marketing-related activities to support accelerated adoption of Renuvion.
Our objective is to achieve profitable, sustainable growth by increasing our market share in the advanced energy category, including the commercialization of products that have the potential to be transformational with respect to the results they produce for surgeons and patients. In order to achieve this objective, we plan to leverage our long history in the industry, along with the reputation for quality and reliability that our brand enjoys within the medical community.

Our Two Business Segments
We currently have two reportable operating segments: Advanced Energy and OEM. The Corporate and Other category includes certain unallocated corporate and administrative costs which are not specifically attributed to any reportable segment. Net assets are shared, therefore, not allocated to the reportable segments.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, our OEM segment contributed 21.7% of our consolidated total revenue and our Advanced Energy segment contributed 78.3% of our consolidated total revenue.
Advanced Energy Segment
Overview
Our product portfolio consists of our Helium Plasma Technology that is marketed and sold as Renuvion® in the cosmetic surgery market and J-Plasma® in the hospital surgical market. Renuvion offers plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons and cosmetic physicians a unique ability to provide controlled heat to the tissue to achieve their desired results. The J-Plasma system allows surgeons to operate with a high level of precision, virtually eliminating unintended tissue trauma. This technology has US FDA clearance, CE mark, and clearance for sale in multiple other countries and is generally indicated for the cutting, coagulation and ablation of soft tissue. The system consists of an electrosurgical generator unit (ESU), a handpiece and a supply of helium gas. The proprietary radiofrequency (RF) energy is delivered to the handpiece by the ESU and used to energize an electrode. When helium gas passes over the energized electrode, helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the patient in the form of a precise helium plasma beam. The energy delivered to the patient via the helium plasma beam is very precise and cooler in temperature in comparison to other surgical energy modalities such as standard RF monopolar energy. This technology has been the subject of ten white papers and has been cited therein for its clinical utility in traditional surgical and cosmetic procedures.
This technology initially received FDA clearance in 2012 and a CE mark in December, 2014, which enables us to sell the product in the European Union. In 2014, we created and trained a direct sales force dedicated to sell this technology. In 2015, we continued the commercialization process for our helium plasma technology with a multi-faceted strategy designed to accelerate adoption of the product. This strategy primarily involved deployment of a dedicated sales force, extending and customizing the product line and expanding the specialties in which this technology can become the “standard of care“ for certain procedures.
During 2018, we continued our full scale commercialization efforts for Renuvion. As of December 31, 2018 we had a direct sales force of 27 field-based selling professionals and a network of 14 independent sales agencies.  We also had three sales managers.  This selling organization is focused on the use of Renuvion in the cosmetic surgery market. In addition, we have invested in training programs and marketing-related activities to support accelerated adoption of Renuvion.
From 2015 through 2018, we launched numerous new J-Plasma products in an effort to target new surgical procedures, users, and markets. As a result of our sales, marketing and product development initiatives, we have significantly increased the number of physicians using J-Plasma by expanding usage to include the cosmetic surgery market in the US, and the cosmetic surgery market as well as the surgical oncology market outside the US.
In 2018 specifically, we launched an updated version of the Apyx Ultimate generator, and a new J-Plasma handpiece for open surgical procedures. The updated version of the Apyx Ultimate generator and the new handpieces allow for the combination of our trademarked Cool-Coag technology and J-Plasma into one, multiple purpose handpiece. Cool-Coag combines standard monopolar coagulation waveforms with helium to provide three distinct modes to stop bleeding including a high fulguration/spray effect. During the second quarter of 2017, we refocused our U.S. sales team into the cosmetic surgery market. Since that time, we have seen a significant increase in the number of physicians using J-Plasma in the cosmetic surgery market.
In order to assist us in leveraging J-Plasma’s precision and effectiveness in multiple surgical specialties, we launched a Medical Advisory Board in 2015 which is currently comprised of surgeons who are recognized leaders in GYN, urology, cardiovascular and cardiothoracic surgery. In 2018, we added an additional surgeon to this board from the cosmetic surgical specialty and plan to add additional members in 2019.
In 2019, our J-Plasma commercial strategy in the U.S. will be primarily focused on advancing the usage of J-Plasma in the cosmetic surgery market (marketed as Renuvion in this segment). In our international markets, we will also focus on cosmetic surgery and

will continue to focus on the surgical oncology market. Our primary international focus will be on advancing the adoption of J-Plasma in the hospital setting. We believe the majority of our targeted procedures in international markets take place in the hospital surgical suite and believe the sales process is shorter in hospitals in international markets as compared to those in the United States. Also, in 2019, we will continue a clinical and regulatory strategy to support our market focus, once complete, we will launch a corresponding marketing campaign.
We are continuing to make substantial investments in the development and marketing of our Renuvion technology for the long-term benefit of the Company and its stakeholders and this may adversely affect our short term profitability and cash flow, particularly over the next 12 to 24 months. While we believe that these investments have the potential to generate additional revenues and profits in the future, there can be no assurance that J-Plasma will be successful or that such future revenues and profitability will be realized.
Customers
We primarily sell our Renuvion products through our direct sales force to physicians, surgical centers and cosmetic surgery offices.
Products
During 2018, Advanced Energy Products consisted of the J-Plasma/Renuvion line of products. The J-Plasma system consists of an electrosurgical generator unit (ESU), a handpiece and a supply of helium gas. Radiofrequency (RF) energy is delivered to the handpiece by the ESU and used to energize an electrode. When helium gas passes over the energized electrode, helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the patient in the form of a precise helium plasma beam. The energy delivered to the patient via the helium plasma beam is very precise and cooler in temperature in comparison to other surgical energy modalities such as standard RF monopolar energy. 
J-Plasma Generator
In June 2017, we launched the newest version of the Apyx Ultimate™ generator. The Apyx Ultimate 2.0 is a high frequency electrosurgical generator that can be used for delivery of RF energy and/or helium gas plasma to cut, coagulate and ablate soft tissue during open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. The generator offers users monopolar, bipolar and J-Plasma features in a single generator. It also powers the Cool-Coag technology that has been incorporated into the new Precise Open J-Plasma handpieces that were released in December 2017. These 2017 new product releases continue to expand the procedure base for J-Plasma by providing the surgeons with the tools they need to access additional anatomic locations and perform specific procedures.
J-Plasma Disposable Portfolio
We offer different hand pieces for open and laparoscopic procedures. The helium-based plasma generated from these devices have been shown to cause less thermal damage to tissue than CO2 laser, argon plasma and RF energy products currently available on the market. The technology has a general indication and can be used for cutting, coagulating and ablating soft tissue. The two primary specialties that are targeted in phase one of the product launch are surgical oncology and cosmetic surgery. The advantages of helium plasma continue to be studied throughout the medical and scientific communities. We believe that surgical applications are just one area of opportunity for this technology.
Competition
Currently, we are the only company with helium-based plasma and retractable blade products. However, there are RF based competitors, argon plasma competitors, and CO2 laser competitors for our target market. We believe our competitive position did not change in 2018.
