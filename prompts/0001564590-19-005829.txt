Item 1: Business
Overview 
 Roku pioneered streaming to the TV and we are capitalizing on this large economic opportunity as a leading TV streaming platform for users, content publishers and advertisers. Roku connects users to the streaming content they love, enables content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provides advertisers with unique capabilities to engage consumers. As of December 31, 2018, we had 27.1 million active accounts and during 2018 our users streamed 24.0 billion hours on the Roku platform. TV streaming’s disruptive content distribution model is shifting billions of dollars of economic value.
 Our business model is to grow gross profit by increasing the number of active accounts and related streaming hours, and growing revenue through the 
monetization of our streaming platform. We measure our platform monetization progress through average revenue per user, or ARPU, which we believe represents the inherent value of our business model. 
We grow new accounts through three primary channels: we sell streaming players; 
we partner with TV brands through our Roku TV licensing program; 
and we have licensing relationships with service operators. The fastest growing source of new accounts comes from our licensing relationships with TV brands and service operators which accounted for 50% of new accounts in 2018, up from 48% in 2017. We believe we have a significant opportunity to grow platform revenue as we further monetize users’ engagement with our TV streaming platform through the insertion of targeted video advertising in ad supported channels, our participation in revenues generated through sales of subscriptions and other transactions on our platform, and the placement of audience development and brand sponsorship promotions across our user interface. ARPU was $17.95 during the year ended December 31, 2018 up by 30% as compared to $13.78 for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
 Our Products and Services 
 Advertising, Content Distribution and Audience Development
 We generate advertising revenues primarily by serving video ads to our users and measuring the return on investment of these ads to advertisers. We collect a variety of information on the Roku platform, including user registration data as well as anonymized information like audience engagement, frequency and content-related use of features, and interactions with advertisements. With our co-branded smart TVs, or Roku TVs, we give users the ability to opt-in to use automatic content recognition and other technology to collect information about what users watch via antenna and devices connected to Roku TVs, and we collect data about the use of the Roku TV’s home screen and antenna programming guide. 
 Advertisers on our platform can reach our over the top, or 
OTT, 
audience with ads that are more relevant, interactive and measurable than advertising delivered on traditional linear TV. Our advertisers include brand marketers and content publishers who use our advertising services to attract and deve
lop their target 
audiences and promote their content on our streaming platform. As traditional TV audiences shrink, OTT audiences have become increasingly important to advertisers who must continue to reach large audiences. Our growth in active accounts and hours streamed has attracted more advertisers and content publishers to our TV streaming platform creating a better user experience. 
 In addition, we 
continue to refine and advance measurement capabilities on our advertising platform. Through our Measure
ment Partner Program, we use tools and partners to provide advertisers the capability to measure audience demographics, validate ad effectiveness, and quantify sales lift from advertising on the Roku platform. We offer engagement analytics such as impressi
ons served, click-through rates and video completion rates. We also work with a wide variety of third-party measurement companies to measure the branding impact of the ads we serve. Furthermore, we 
have relationships with third-party providers that focus on transactional or point of sale data, which enables our advertisers to compare the effectiveness of Roku ads to traditional linear television advertising.
 Our primary advertising products include: 
  
• | Video ads. Our ad-supported content publishers use video ads to monetize our users and we also use video ads to monetize our platform. Video ads are sold within channels on the Roku platform as 15-

second or 30-second spots inserted before a program starts or during a program break. One of the ways we secure video ad insertion rights from content publishers is via our distribution deals with those publishers. In addition, we can also serve as a source of revenue for content publishers who participate on The Roku Channel, and channels that authorize us to fill their unsold advertising inventory. Except for a minority of video ads that are passed unmodified in a traditional linear broadcast, all video ads are selected and delivered to a user in real-time, as the user is engaging on our platform. On the Roku platform, our video ads play full screen, are not skippable in most channels and are delivered into a curated channel list, which alleviates many of the concerns that some digital advertisers have with major online video distributors.

• | Brand sponsorships. We support a variety of promotional opportunities for advertisers, such as sponsored themes on our home screen and content sponsorships to give users the opportunity to experience a free movie or show (e.g. “Family movie night brought to you by…”). We also sell branded content rows on The Roku Channel.

• | Audience Marketplace. Through our Audience Marketplace program, we provide advertising buyers and sellers with the means to more effectively target audiences on the Roku platform in the United States. We leverage our first-party data and proprietary ad technology to enhance the ability of publishers to sell targeted audiences on the Roku platform to advertisers.

 We utilize a variety of ad placements, particularly native display ads, on the Roku home screen 
and screen saver to help content publishers drive channel downloads and traffic to their channels in order to drive subscriptions or movie and TV show consumption. We also sell branded channel buttons on player and Roku TV remote controls. The branded buttons provide easy access and drive incremental usage by allowing users to launch straight into the channel.
 We provide our content publishers with access to the most engaged OTT audience, as measured by average hours streamed. We negotiate revenue share agreements with content publishers for distribution on the Roku platform. Our platform enables content publishers to distribute streaming content through three primary business models, transaction video on demand, or TVOD, that includes channels that offer a la carte movie purchases or rentals, subscription video on demand, or SVOD, that includes subscriptions to individual video on demand channels and so-called virtual multichannel video programming distribution services, and advertising supported video on demand, AVOD, that includes channels that do not charge a subscription fee to users. We generate revenue from TVOD and SVOD channels from various forms of revenue sharing arrangements. Our revenue sharing arrangements generally apply to new subscriptions for accounts that sign up for new services and at the time of a movie rental or purchase for TVOD. Revenue from the distribution of AVOD channels is generated through the sale of advertising within the channel.
 AVOD is our fastest growing distribution model, and we are increasing the monetization of these hours by expanding our advertising capabilities both on and off the Roku platform. We intend to continue to leverage our data and analytics to deliver relevant advertising and improve the ability of our advertisers to optimize their campaigns and measure their results. We also plan to continue to expand our direct sales teams to increase the number of advertisers who use our services. 
 In late 2017, we launched The Roku Channel, which offers ad-supported free access for users to a collection of films, television series and other content, and at the same time we began a fundamental transition to increase video advertising inventory under our control and to create another way of connecting content publishers with users. The Roku Channel has grown from providing customers with free access to 1,000 movies and TV episodes to roughly 10,000 today and is rapidly becoming one of our leading sources of advertising inventory. In January 20
19, we launched Premium Subscriptions within The Roku Channel, through which we resell ad-free premium content subscription services from providers such as Showtime, Starz and Epix directly to our users. 
 Roku TVs and Streaming Players
 We acquire users by offering low cost streaming players and through Roku TVs that are manufactured and sold by TV brands that enter into licensing arrangements with us.

Roku TVs integrate our Roku Operating System, or Roku OS, and leverage our smart TV hardware reference design. We work with our TV brand licensees to assist in all phases of the development of Roku TVs, including development, planning, manufacturing and marketing. Roku TV brand licensees include TCL, Element, Hisense, Hitachi, JVC, RCA, Philips, Sanyo, Sharp, and Magnavox. They are available in sizes ranging from 24” to 75” at leading retailers in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In 2018, more than one in four smart TVs sold in the United States were Roku TVs. 
 We offer streaming players for sale under the Roku brand in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, the Republic of Ireland, Mexico and several other Latin American countries. We also license our Roku OS and streaming player designs, and provide ongoing technology and support services, to certain service operators that distribute Roku Powered players to their subscribers. All players run on the Roku OS, and stream content via built-in Ethernet or Wi-Fi capability, depending on the model. Our current streaming player line for the U.S. market includes several models at a range of manufacturers’ suggested retail prices to meet the needs of different users starting at $29.99. 
 Technology 
 We believe that the core technology supporting the Roku OS is a critical competitive advantage and therefore we continue to make substantial investments in our research and development efforts to enhance our platform for users, content publishers and advertisers. We have invested in delivering broad search and discovery capabilities for our users in order to organize and manage the vast amounts of content and pricing information on our platform. Our cloud-based search and discovery features for users are powered by state-of-the-art servers and databases that are purpose-built and support large scale audiences. We have also introduced user experience technology such as private listening and voice search for certain streaming devices. 
 For content publishers, we offer our open Channel Developer Program to create streaming channels. The Channel Developer Program is based on our Software Development Kit, or SDK, and proprietary implementation of the Brightscript scripting language, which is optimized to provide robust performance and a consistent user experience on any device with the Roku platform. Channel Developers may also take advantage of our feed-based Roku Direct Publisher program, which does not require content publishers to write a single line of code to publish a channel on our platform. 
 For advertisers, the Roku Ad Framework, or RAF, technology is integrated into the Roku OS. RAF provides a variety of critical and advanced advertising capabilities, including IAB VAST ad processing, interactive rich media features, demographic measurement, device IDs, user privacy controls and compatibility with all major video ad servers, SSPs and DSPs. 
 Our proprietary systems leverage our feature extraction, information retrieval and matching systems to provide the most relevant ads. The Roku OS also includes our core data platform that manages and analyzes billions of technical and user events and terabytes of uncompressed data that is processed through our platform each day. We use leading big data analytic technologies to identify rich insights to improve user, content publisher and advertiser value from the Roku platform. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We drive growth in our platform by building relationships with content publishers, advertisers, TV brands and service operators. We have dedicated business development teams that develop and maintain relationships, to promote and build awareness of the features and advantages of the Roku platform. Our data science team supports our sales and marketing efforts by analyzing data on our platform to increase effectiveness for our content publishers and advertisers as well as for our consumer marketing campaigns. We enter into distribution agreements with our content publishers and license their content through our dedicated content relationship management team. We sell advertising with two direct sales teams, one focused on content publishers, the other focused on traditional advertisers. Our relationship with content publishers is typically client-direct. We secure direct access to publishers’ video ad inventory as part of our distribution agreements and serve as an additional channel for content publishers to monetize their audience. These sales efforts are differentiated and complementary to that of our content publishers. Whereas our publishers typically sell on a cross-platform basis and feature their brand and content in their sale, we 
 7


focus on delivering a large OTT audience across many channels at once. We work with the major ad agencies and holding companies including Dentsu, Havas, Horizon, IPG, Publicis and WPP. We also offer smaller content publishers a self-serve platform to buy promotions and are increasingly incorporating programmatic capabilities into our advertising sales. We work with TV brands to assist in all phases of the development of Roku TVs, including development, planning, manufacturing and marketing, and similarly work with service operators on the planning and development of their Roku Powered players. 
 We grow our users by providing consumers with low cost, widely available players and TVs and we promote them using a wide range of marketing techniques. Our players and TVs are available at over 16,000 retail locations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, the Republic of Ireland, Mexico and several other Latin American countries. The majority of streaming players and Roku TVs are sold in the United States through traditional brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy, Target and Walmart, including their online sales platforms, and online retailers such as Amazon. We also sell players in the United States directly through our website. In addition, in some cases, we sell our streaming players to service operators or channel partners who bundle such players with services that they sell to their customers. We also sell products internationally through distributors and to retailers such as Currys in the United Kingdom and Amazon in France. In 2018 and 2017, Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart each accounted for more than 10% of our player revenue. These three retailers collectively accounted for 68% and 61% of our player revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. These retailers also sell products offered by our competitors. We support retailers with an experienced sales management team and work closely with these retailers to assist with in-store marketing and product mix forecasting, leading us to be a category captain in many major retail locations. 
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development model relies upon a combination of in-house staff and out-sourced design and manufacturing partners to cost-effectively improve and enhance our platform, and to develop new players, TVs, features and functionality. We work closely with content publishers, advertisers, TV brands and service operators to understand their current and future needs. We have designed a product development process that captures and integrates their feedback. In addition, we solicit user feedback in the development of new features and enhancements to the Roku platform. 
 We intend to continue to significantly invest in research and development to bring new devices to market and expand our platform and capabilities. 
 Manufacturing 
 We outsource the manufacturing of our products to contract manufacturers, using our design specifications. All of our products are manufactured by contract manufacturers located in the People’s Republic of China. Our contracts do not obligate them to supply products to us in any specific quantity or at any specific price. Our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble our products to demand forecasts we establish based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions. The contract manufacturers ship our products to our third-party warehouses in California and England where they ship players directly to retailers, wholesale distributors and to end users. 
Government Regulation 
 Our devices and platform are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. These laws and regulations include general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specific to providers of Internet-delivered streaming services and devices. New laws and regulations in these areas may have an adverse effect on our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. If we fail to comply with these laws, we may be subject to significant liabilities and other penalties. 
 In particular, our business is subject to foreign and domestic laws and regulations applicable to companies conducting business using the Internet. Both domestic and international jurisdictions vary widely as to how, or whether, existing laws governing areas such as personal privacy and data security, consumer protection, payment processing or sales and other taxes and intellectual property apply to the Internet and e-commerce, and these laws 
 8


are continually evolving. Moreover, the laws governing these areas, as well as those governing electronic contracts and Internet content and access restrictions, among other areas, are rapidly evolving. The laws in these areas are unsettled and future developments are unpredictable. Laws that lead to more stringent regulation of companies engaging in businesses using the Internet may have a negative impact on our business. 
 We are also subject to both general and e-commerce specific privacy laws and regulations that may require us to provide users with our policies on sharing information with third parties and advance notice of any changes to these policies. Related laws may govern the manner in which we store or transfer sensitive information or impose obligations on us in the event of a security breach or inadvertent disclosure of such information. International jurisdictions impose different, and sometimes more stringent, consumer and privacy protections, including the European Union’s newly enacted General Data Protection Regulation. Such consumer privacy laws are constantly changing and may become more diverse and restrictive over time, challenging our ability to fully comply with these laws in all jurisdictions. Privacy laws also may limit the ability of advertisers to fully utilize our platform, which could have a negative impact on our business. 
 Tax regulations in domestic and international jurisdictions where we do not currently collect state or local taxes may subject us to the obligation to collect and remit such taxes, to additional taxes or to requirements intended to assist jurisdictions with their tax collection efforts. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and e-commerce generally could result in significant additional taxes on our business. Further, we could be subject to fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements. The continued growth and demand for e-commerce is likely to result in more laws and regulations that impose additional compliance burdens on e-commerce companies, and any such developments could harm our business. 
 In addition, the Internet is a vital component of our business and also is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in jurisdictions throughout the world. We expect to rely on the historical openness and accessibility of the Internet to conduct our business, and government regulations that impede or fail to preserve the open Internet could harm our business. To the extent regulatory agencies adopt rules that allow network operators to restrict the flow of content over the Internet, such operators may seek to extract fees from us or our content publishers to deliver our traffic or may otherwise engage in blocking, throttling or other discriminatory practices with respect to our traffic, which could adversely impact our business. 
 Our content publishers also are subject to a wide range of government regulations that may vary by jurisdiction. Because our business depends on the availability of third-party content delivered over the Internet, increased regulation of our content publishers or changes in laws or regulations governing Internet retransmission of third-party content could increase our expenses and adversely affect our business and the attractiveness of our platform. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, patents and domain names to protect our intellectual property. Our trademarks, including “Roku” and the Roku logo and design, are an important part of our branding and the value of our business. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 70 issued U.S. patents (of which 16 are design patents) and 9 issued European Community design patents. 
 The claims for which we have sought patent protection apply to both our devices and software. Our patent and patent applications generally apply to the features and functions of our Roku OS and the applications associated with our platform. 
 We also incorporate generally available third-party software, including open source software, in our Roku OS and our platform, pursuant to licenses with such third parties. The termination of these software licenses would require redesign of parts of the Roku OS and our platform, which could delay or impair our ability to offer our devices and platform. 
 9


We enter into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and business partners, and generally control access and use of our proprietary and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls. These steps may not be adequate, however, and may not be effective to protect our intellectual property in the United States or other international markets in which we do business. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights or may challenge our issued patents. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our competitors could offer similar products and services which would harm our business. 
 Competition 
 The market for streaming media is continuing to grow and evolve. We face substantial competition from large technology and consumer electronics companies including Amazon, Google and Apple. These competitors have helped to increase consumer awareness of TV streaming and have contributed to the growth and evolution of the overall streaming media marketplace. However, their resources and brand recognition pose significant competitive challenges. In the face of this competition, our success in capitalizing on the expanding opportunities in the streaming market will depend on our ability to acquire users by delivering high quality devices at competitive prices and developing and monetizing engaged audiences with compelling content, promotional services and advertising.
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,111 full-time employees, of which 624 were in research and development, 304 were in sales and marketing, and 183 were in general and administrative and operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
