Overview
 
We are a leading software development company based in Tokyo, Japan. We provide software through two business units. The first business unit includes a customer experience management business that has been in existence for 12 years. Our CXM Platform includes marketing, sales, service and content management systems, as well as other tools and integrations, that enable companies to attract and engage customers throughout the customer experience. We also provide education, services and support to help customers be successful with our CXM Platform.
 
The second business unit is a digital transformation business which provides customers with robotics process automation, process mining and task mining to accelerate the digital transformation of enterprises. We also have an ongoing technology innovation team to develop software that supports the narrow needs of large enterprise customers.
 
We have made significant investments in our sales and marketing efforts globally. As of December 31, 2022, our sales and marketing organization was comprised of 14 employees including our field sales organization, which maintains a physical sales presence in the Japanese software market. Using our go-to-market strategy, we believe we have made significant contributions in Japan and have established a diversified revenue and customer base. As of December 31, 2022, our combined business units (customer experience management business unit and digital transformation business unit) had 903 total customers in Japan, of which 645, or 71.4%, were paying customers, and 24 total customers outside Japan, of which 2, or 0.2%, was a paying customer. Our 280 non-paying customers were originally paying customers that utilized our paid services but now use a free version of the CXM Platform. There is the potential for non-paying customers to become paying customers again if and when they start utilizing our paid services again.
 
On September 6, 2022, HeartCore Enterprises, Inc. entered into a share exchange and purchase agreement (“Sigmaways Agreement”) to acquire 51% of the outstanding shares of Sigmaways, a company incorporated under the laws of the State of California and is engaged in the business of developing and sales of software in the United States. The acquisition closed on February 1, 2023.
 
During 2022, we started the GO IPO business, which supports Japanese companies to list on Nasdaq and NYSE in the United States. As of March 30, 2023, we have entered into consulting agreements with nine companies to assist them in their IPO process, whereby we are entitled to receive from each company a consulting fee ranges from $350,000 to $900,000 and warrants or Japanese acquisition rights to purchase one to four percent of the fully-diluted share capital of such companies that is exercisable on certain dates at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The revenue in the GO IPO business helped to offset the decline in sales in the CX and DX divisions. In the first quarter of 2023, we formed HeartCore Financial and HeartCore Capital Advisors as a part of our Go IPO consulting business.
 
Industry Overview
 
Customer Experience Management Business
 
Companies must manage a huge amount of content, collaborate with other kinds of business processes, and build infrastructure to fulfill customers’ needs. To make it happen, companies need a content management system that allows easy implementation of a wide range of features including content creation, analysis, search capability and access controls into their websites, and enables them to deliver and receive content at the best time responding market changes. A customer experience management system is also becoming essential for companies to manage customers and deliver personalized content based on the users’ behavior, device, location and context. A customer experience management system is also required to analyze big data to deliver even the subconscious wants and needs of customers. Furthermore, these capabilities are not supposed to be limited to general websites but also to various kinds of services such as E-commerce, smartphone sites, smartphone apps, social networking services, blogs, and digital signage. Content management systems and customer experience management systems need to provide rich features to fill the new generation of customers’ needs.

Digital Transformation Business
 
RPA is a technology that allows automation for a defined set of tasks. RPA robots can emulate most human-computer interactions to carry out error-free tasks at high volume and speed. Some common tasks RPA can do include: (i) invoice processing; (ii) process sales orders; (iii) account reconciliation; (iv) enterprise resource planning data entry for core processes such as finance, human resources, manufacturing, supply chain, services, and procurement; (v) employee onboarding; (vi) payroll; and (vii) data queries.
 
As companies have strived to automate, it has become more and more challenging to identify RPA opportunities. This has included uncovering processes that would be good candidates for automation and having fundamental metrics about those processes (via task mining and process mining technology) at their disposal – like utilization and the specific steps in the process if it is not already documented – to aid them in their decision.
 
Task mining is a technology that enables organizations to discover, understand, and analyze the tasks employees perform as they relate to completing larger processes. Task mining software works by monitoring the actions users take. A recorder is installed on an employee’s computer to capture their interactions in the different applications they use, recording data like keystrokes, clicks, data entry, etc., to uncover how tasks are completed within the organization. The purpose of using task mining software is to discover and understand the tasks employees are performing. The ultimate objective is to find ways to improve how those tasks are carried out or automate them to increase operational efficiency, reduce errors, and improve employee engagement.
 
Process mining is a technology that investigates the mountains of data in enterprise event logs to discover and present end-to-end processes that the organization is performing to complete work. Event logs are essentially banks of data that store different information. The benefit of process mining software is that it presents the process it successfully mined, along with the process’ variants and suggestions on how to optimize and improve that process. Like task mining, the most common use case for adopting process mining technology is to improve processes, with the ideal goal of automating them for all the benefits and returns that come with automation, like improved customer and employee experiences.
 
Industry Characteristics
 
Explosive Growth of Cloud-Based Applications Creating a New Era of IT Complexity. Businesses around the world are spending hundreds of billions of dollars to adopt applications that help advance digital transformation and drive competitive advantages. With the proliferation of cloud technologies and SaaS, traditional software suites have been disaggregated into point solutions. For example, human capital management software has been segregated across recruiting, payroll, benefits administration, and other key business functions. As a result, enterprises have transitioned from managing a handful of multi-purpose, largely on-premises applications to managing hundreds and even thousands of specialized point solutions deployed across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments. According to the Wall Street Journal, in 2019 the number of software applications deployed by large firms across all industries worldwide had increased by approximately 70% over the previous four years. These applications, which were generally not designed for interoperability, run in tandem with long-running, legacy technologies. The increasing volume of applications has a compounding effect on the complexity of business processes and the IT environments that support them.
 
The Benefits of Digital Transformation Have Yet to Make Their Way to the Workforce. Modern enterprise applications enable deep and nuanced functionalities, such as conducting personalized marketing campaigns, predictive service delivery, and real time visibility of goods movement across the supply chain. However, despite massive functional advancement, the true promise and potential of digital transformation—reallocating human capital towards cognitive, higher-value activities—remains elusive, which is limiting improvements in productivity. For example, in the United States, non-farm real output per hour grew 31% during the decade ended December 31, 2009, but only 13% in the subsequent decade ended December 31, 2019.
 
Individual Business Processes Rely on Multiple Business Applications, and Workers to Orchestrate Them. While specialized applications deliver extensive functionality, they do not account for the full spectrum of how work gets done. The proliferation of specialized applications has resulted in humans being the connective tissue in an enterprise, working across a wide range of applications that individually are not built to address the needs of the actual processes they are supporting. As a result, activities performed by many workers today are still manual, mundane, and administrative tasks, limiting workers from focusing on higher-value activities that can directly improve business performance.

Automation is the New Frontier of Competitive Differentiation. Enterprises are demanding a new approach to unify, tailor, and run applications without significant IT resources or changes to existing infrastructure. Automation enables organizations to design and optimize business processes to improve productivity and business performance. Additionally, automation solutions that can accurately and consistently emulate human behavior can work within existing business processes in a way that traditional applications cannot. This allows businesses to harness the power of specialized applications in a differentiated manner. With the ability to emulate human behavior, this new approach to automation is disrupting traditional automation and transforming data-processing work by allowing customers to find efficiencies without materially changing business processes and supporting infrastructure.
 
Empowering Workers to Automate their Personal Workflows is Leading to a Democratization of Automation. The emerging workforce is graduating with increasingly advanced technical skills and training in automation. Individuals are entering the workforce with higher expectations related to job impact, satisfaction, and efficiency, and view software as a driving force in realizing those expectations. As a result, organizations are looking to empower workers with tools to optimize the more tedious parts of their jobs. The combination of technology that can emulate human behavior and a workforce with the knowledge and tools to create their own automations has enabled enterprises to begin to automate a significant number of use cases, from individual tasks to enterprise-wide processes.
 
Cost of Skilled Human Capital is Accelerating the Evolution Towards the Fully Automated Enterprise. The cost of skilled human capital continues to rise due to growing demand. We believe it is increasingly imperative for enterprises to leverage automation to liberate workers from menial, repetitive, and less productive tasks and to better utilize the positive qualities that only humans have, such as abstract thinking, making connections, dealing with ambiguity, creativity, innovation, passion, and community engagement. We believe this will drive business value and greater employee engagement. According to a 2020 Gallup study, business units with highly engaged employees are more present and productive; more attuned to the needs of customers; and more observant of processes, standards, and systems. When taken together, the behaviors of highly engaged business units result in 21% greater profitability.
 
Limitations of Existing Offerings
 
A number of technology companies have attempted to address the automation needs of organizations through the application of business process management, application development software offerings, RPA tools, and AI point offerings, as well as other horizontal software applications. However, these existing offerings are challenged by a number of inherent limitations, including:
 
Lack of An End-to-End Software. Many existing automation software offerings are point technologies and cannot offer end-to-end automation capabilities on an integrated software.
 
Not Capable of Emulating Human Behavior, Relying too Heavily on APIs. Many existing offerings do not effectively integrate AI computer vision and machine learning (“ML”) capabilities needed to accurately identify and emulate human actions in conjunction with APIs. Without these capabilities, organizations are limited to pursuing automation only within the narrow pathways permitted by existing APIs. Even when applications have an API, the functionality provided often does not fully capture what is required to conduct the business process. As the scope of a task or process expands from a single, discrete action to a sequence of multiple steps and sub-processes, the limitation in scope and complexity of supported API actions becomes more of an impediment to fully emulating the process. This frequently prevents this work from being truly automated solely through APIs alone. Bringing APIs together with an emulative approach made possible by AI computer vision and machine learning greatly expands the use cases for automation.
 
Inability to Automate Across Applications. While business processes typically involve multiple applications, many existing automation capabilities are built into specific applications and are limited in their ability to automate business processes across multiple applications. Accordingly, we believe enterprises build inefficient business processes to compensate for limited cross-functional automation capabilities.

Difficult to Link AI Capabilities to Execution. AI and ML (“AI/ML”) capabilities are needed to automate cognitive, high-value tasks. In recent years, enterprises have made significant investments in developing AI/ML models. However, it is difficult to leverage these models as the environments for developing them, typically used by data scientists, are distinct from the environments where processes are carried out, typically by employees using enterprise applications. This separation of environments limits the ability of an organization to deploy models that are necessary to automate complex processes.
 
Need to Change an Enterprise’s Underlying Infrastructure. Existing offerings generally are unable to emulate the human’s role in executing a business process, requiring organizations to make significant changes either to their applications and infrastructure or to the business processes themselves. The costs associated with changing underlying infrastructure and business processes make it uneconomical to automate anything outside of narrowly defined, high-volume tasks.
 
Unable to Realize Full Value of Automation Throughout an Organization. Existing solutions do not typically make automations accessible to everyone within the organization as they are often built with non-intuitive user interfaces and code heavy technology stacks. These solutions are too technical for most knowledge workers, limiting their application to a small number of use cases and users with significant developer experience. Existing solutions also frequently require additional time and resources to enable the resulting automation to be used by non-technical workers or to adapt the automation to nonstandard circumstances and environments.
 
Lack Governance Capabilities at Scale. Existing offerings do not typically offer centralized, secure governance capabilities to enforce, manage, and deploy organizational development standards.
 
Difficult to Deploy. We believe existing automation solutions generally require complicated, invasive implementation processes that, in turn, require extensive upfront and ongoing training and time commitment. This makes it difficult to build and maintain automations, resulting in the persistence of manual processes throughout enterprises.
 
Lack of Openness and Interoperability. Many existing solutions are not modular and lack the ability to integrate new, third-party technologies and operate with customized applications. Enterprises using these solutions are locked into a limited set of proprietary options not built for the future.
 
Lack of an Engaged Community of Automation Developers. Many existing automation vendors do not have open software and have not invested the time and resources required to cultivate a vibrant ecosystem of automation developers that freely exchange innovations and best practices.
 
Addressable Market
 
Our software addresses the market for intelligent process automation, which, in February 2021, International Data Corporation estimates to grow at a five-year compound annual growth rate of approximately 18.4% to $37.9 billion by the end of 2024. However, we believe that this does not fully encompass the opportunity associated with our vision of the fully automated enterprise.
 
According to an estimate by Bain & Company in the report Beyond Cost Savings: Reinventing Business Through Automation, the expansion of automation software by incorporating broader capabilities and technologies has increased the size of the addressable market for automation software to approximately $65 billion.
 
The size of our addressable market opportunity is underpinned by the substantial amount of business processes that could be improved through automation but are not currently automated. According to Forbes, there are more than 1 billion knowledge workers globally as of December 10, 2020. We expect our estimated global market opportunity will continue to expand as customers increase the size of their business units and hire additional employees, resulting in a greater number of users and processes that can benefit from automation throughout these enterprises. Additionally, we believe that we are unlocking a myriad of still unexplored automation possibilities as we continue to contribute to this market. We believe those possibilities represent a significant greenfield opportunity for us.

Build Business Resiliency and Agility into Digital Business Operations. Our software provides our customers with the flexibility they need to operate under ever-changing conditions. A company’s operations change over time. If companies have to modify their robots each time a change occurs, true efficiency will not be achieved. Our software robots are not only capable of performing tasks just like humans, but they can also keep changing as the business changes. Our robots can be deployed manned, unmanned, desktop, server-side, or hybrid, and can adjust seamlessly as conditions change. If necessary, they can also utilize spare resources in the enterprise (such as desktops at midnight) to perform time-consuming tasks and processes. Our software provides our customers with the ability to have a virtually unlimited digital workforce that operates 24/7, resulting in a more efficient and less error-prone digital workflow.
 
Fast Time-to-Value. We believe that our solutions provide companies with an immediate return on investment. Our software can be easily installed on any operating system, or company. It is also designed to be intuitive, minimizing the need for time-consuming and costly implementation and training. With automatic recording and playback capabilities, workers can create robots by simply performing routine tasks. Our simulation feature also allows us to verify the efficiency of the automation before it goes live and measure its effectiveness. By using our software, customers can reap significant benefits such as improved costs and increased worker productivity.
 
Organization-Wide Automation. Powerful, easy-to-use software allows workers across an enterprise organization to automate their work. Our software is designed to automate any business process or task, from individual desktop tasks to complex mission-critical business processes for departments across the enterprise. It also provides development software that does not require technical skills, allowing any employee in the organization to spread the automation. This will help spread automation throughout the organization as employees across departments and job functions use our technology to improve their performance.
 
Inspect, improve, and analyze business execution. Our solutions provide visibility into how work is actually being done in the enterprise, enabling our customers to understand, identify, and execute automation opportunities on an ongoing basis. For example, if there is duplication of work between multiple departments, you can choose to automate one of them but not the other. This allows us to optimize the automation. Our solution leverages advanced process discovery techniques and ML models from actual log data to understand individual patterns for executing work and address bottlenecks and inefficiencies. It is a very powerful solution that can optimize the entire company.
 
Improve Employee Productivity, Experience, and Satisfaction. By using our solutions, companies can achieve true digital transformation and establish a better work environment for their workers. With our software, enterprise workers will be able to automate tasks that can be used and operated efficiently and automate time-consuming manual tasks. We believe that this will improve the overall experience of our customers’ employees and allow them to focus on developing higher value-added skill sets. As a result, our clients will be able to retain a high-value, engaged workforce that is capable of delivering optimal business results.
 
Improve Accuracy and Compliance with Speed. Operations automated by our software are designed to be performed consistently as designed, allowing companies to achieve greater accuracy. For example, a sudden change in the user interface of a website will not affect the execution of the robot. It is very highly adaptive and is designed to eliminate human errors and inconsistencies that are common to workers who do their work manually. The work performed by the robot generates a log that can be reviewed and monitored at any time, allowing administrators to better control and comply with the work.
 
Enhance Customer Experiences. Companies can use our robots to solve known problems faster and more efficiently. We can also identify potential problems and help solve them. Business is always changing, and our software allows employees to focus on addressing critical customer issues and concerns, rather than performing repetitive, routine, and low-value tasks. Our robots improve the overall speed, accuracy, and effectiveness of a company’s customer service, increasing customer retention and loyalty.

Key Benefits to Employees
 
Our software is designed to eliminate the need for employees to execute low-value, manual tasks, freeing up time to focus on more meaningful, strategic work. We believe that this, in turn, causes employees to feel empowered and be more valuable in contributing to broader organizational goals. “Robotics Engineer” is one of the fastest emerging job roles globally, with LinkedIn reporting a 40% compound annual growth rate in job postings from 2015 to 2019. According to a survey conducted by International Data Corporation, 53% of respondents indicated that AI and robotics would have a positive impact on jobs in their companies. Additionally, according to a survey published in UiPath, Inc.’s 2020 “State of the RPA Developer Report,” 84% of respondents believe that having RPA skills would positively impact their future career moves.
 
We believe the democratization of automation leads to the following benefits tied to an improved employee experience:
 

● | greater professional fulfillment and job satisfaction; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------
● | increased creativity and innovation; 
● | improved performance and accuracy; 
● | enhanced skillsets;

HeartCore Community
 
We have created and cultivated a vibrant, global network of nearly several hundred thousand automation professionals who are building and sharing automations that are transforming work and their organizations.
 
Our Digital Transformation Products
 
Our software is built so that automation processes can be used throughout the enterprise. Customers can either adopt our products as a unified solution or use a subset of our products for each.
Discover
 
Process Mining. Process mining visualizes the event logs generated through various systems and applications by connecting them in chronological order and by pattern, by using process mining tools. This enables us to identify problems and their causes, such as exception processing that creates a burden for corrective actions, insufficient segregation of duties and rule deviations, inefficient business processing, bottlenecks, etc., so that we can improve our business effectively and speedily. In addition, if using the function to evaluate whether or not there is a problem by using the best practices of business processes as benchmarks, it becomes easier to examine the image of appropriate business processes. Furthermore, by updating the data to be captured and monitoring it continuously, it is possible to recognize the performance of business quality, changes, and anomalies in a timely manner, which can lead to improvements.
 
Currently, business process reforms are rapidly advancing, as exemplified by the automation of routine tasks through the introduction of RPA. In business process reform efforts, business processes have traditionally been visualized and evaluated in order to identify inefficient operations that need to be improved. However, these methods require a great deal of time and effort, such as interviewing the person in charge of the business, manually transcribing the contents of the business manual, which lacks accuracy and completeness, into a business flow, and repeatedly checking and revising the transcribed contents with various parties involved in the business. Furthermore, depending on the level of understanding and risk sensitivity of the interviewees, infrequent exceptions and so-called local rules were sometimes overlooked.

One of the concepts that will drive and enhance digital transformation is digital twin technology. Digital twin technology reproduces what is happening in a factory in a computer, for example, by outputting logs of information on machine tools, manufacturing equipment, and products in production, and putting the logs into process mining. It is also called a digital twin organization, which is an organization model that makes it easier to understand and manage business processes in real time, and to plan for the future. Using a model that behaves like a twin of a real factory system, it is possible to test the effects of production conditions that are not possible in reality, to test processes for efficiency, and to predict fatigue when manufacturing equipment is kept running. This factory simulation environment can reproduce the same environment as in reality.
 
In the 5G era, local 5G will be able to collect even more detailed logs of the factory. This will increase the accuracy of the simulations and enable even more advanced operational efficiency. By recreating not only factories but also white-collar workplaces in a digital twin, it will be possible to identify problems, eliminate bottlenecks, change workflows, and reform work styles.
 
Task Mining. Task mining is a method of analyzing individual PC operations of staff engaged in various tasks, i.e., detailed PC operation log data such as “application launch,” “screen launch,” “file open,” “mouse click,” “text input,” “copy and paste,” etc., to discover issues and problems. Task mining can highlight task-level issues such as, for example, whether a series of tasks to convert paper documents into digital data by reading them with OCR is taking longer than expected (inefficient tasks), or copying and pasting from email body to Excel is repeated with high frequency (repetitive tasks).
 
The merit of task mining is that it can point out issues and problems related to tasks, i.e., the various tasks that individual staff members perform on their PCs, based on facts such as the actual time required and the number of tasks processed. Conventional business analysis based on interviews can only provide information based on the subjective and sensory perceptions of the workers themselves, and the accuracy and reliability of the analysis results are not always high. In addition, the on-site measurement work by a researcher with a stopwatch was not only time-consuming and costly, but also had the possibility of adversely affecting the work itself of the workers to be measured. On the other hand, in the case of task mining, since the analysis targets the PC operation logs automatically collected through the sensors (agents) installed on each PC, the flow of work based on the facts as they can be reproduced. Therefore, the analysis results are extremely accurate and reliable. Moreover, it does not place a burden on the person in charge in the field.
 
Using task mining, the time and cost of collecting detailed business data can be significantly reduced and because it is fact-based, highly accurate and reliable analysis results can be obtained.
 
Manage
 
Robot Automation Portal. Our Robot Automation Portal is a web portal that allows customers to monitor and manage automation with RPA over a TCP/IP network (Internet and/or Intranet). The Robot Automation Portal records the results generated from the time the robot machine is registered in the portal. Customers can manage and operate all RPA robots in their company, and also report the results and monitor their status. Our Robot Automation Portal also provides an orchestration function that allows customers to send a robot to a terminal where RPA is not installed, run it in free time, and return only the results. This allows our clients to make full use of their internal resources.
 
Orchestrator. Our Orchestrator can provision, deploy, trigger, monitor, measure, and track the successful operation of robots on any supported device, and when combined with the Robot Automation Portal, it does so through a GUI interface.
 
CUI interface. There are many cases where GUI is not available for servers such as Linux and UNIX, etc., so our RPA also has a CUI command interface.
 
All robots are provided as JAR files, so as long as customers have a Java environment, they can run the robots and automate their operations without installing RPA.

Run
 
Development RPA. It is possible to create robots freely using flowcharts in a GUI interface, or to create robots by coding in the same way as Java development, using an interface similar to a Java IDE. It also comes with three types of OCR, making it suitable for creating a business robot that scans documents.
 
Execution RPA. The license is only for running the robot. Only one robot can be run simultaneously per license. The execution environment can be any device and any operating system. Although there is only one concurrent execution, there can be an unlimited number of installations.
 
Measure
 
When we start to automate with RPA robots, we tend to automate even tasks that would be more efficient without automation. This is an ironic result of automation becoming inefficient, but it is difficult to identify. Using our simulation and reporting functions, it is possible to identify inefficient automated tasks and change them to efficient operations. That may possibly be tasks that are performed by people, but the cost will vary greatly.
Govern
 
We offer powerful, centralized governance capabilities designed to ensure compliance with business standards. Our software balances compliance with empowerment through granular control of what can be automated, who can build and publish automations, and complete lifecycle management with role-based access control and enforcement. Governance capabilities are embedded across our software. The combination of our measurement and governance capabilities are critical as they are key to enterprise-scale automation programs and are a differentiated feature of our software.
Sales and Marketing
 
We have an efficient go-to-market model, which consists primarily of an enterprise field sales force supplemented by a high velocity inside sales team focused on small and mid-sized customers as well as a global strategic sales team focused on the largest global customers.
 
We have made significant investments in our sales and marketing efforts globally. As of December 31, 2022, our sales and marketing organization was comprised of 14 employees including our field sales organization, which maintains a physical sales presence in the Japanese software market.

Digital Transformation Business
 
We believe that the following are key strengths of our digital transformation business:
 
Broad Set of Complementary Solutions. Our software combines OCR, AI, task mining, process mining, RPA, and process discovery capabilities to enable automation across multiple non-desktop systems, mission-critical system-to-system automation deployment environments, and cloud-to-cloud applications. We can help you automate multiple systems without desktops, automation deployment environments between mission-critical systems, and across cloud applications. We provide our customers with a comprehensive set of capabilities to discover, build, manage, execute, engage, measure, and control automation across departments and personas within an organization or agency. Our software can run on multiple operating systems, including Linux, Unix, Mac, AS-400, as well as Windows, allowing for automation across a variety of systems. Also, since it is coded in Java, any Java engineer can easily build add-on functions.
 
Open Architecture. Our software embraces an open ecosystem with hundreds of enterprise application integrations that have been built by us and our community of technology partners. Our solution includes a variety of pre-built activities and connectors so customers can quickly create and deploy robots that execute operations and seamlessly interact with third-party systems. Our open ecosystem is architecture agnostic, which allows organizations to automate existing infrastructure and accelerate digital innovation without the need to replace or make large investments in their existing infrastructure.
 
Built-In AI/ML Capabilities. We incorporate our own Java components into our products to drive continuous improvement in business automation. Our RPA is a system that allows the reuse of existing programming assets to address complex use cases. Users can incorporate their current Java applications, if any, into our RPA. Furthermore, it does not only automate that application, but also expands the scope of integration with other applications. The capabilities of our software are not limited to automating existing operations, but can also adapt to ever-changing variables, such as the application of new business models, to achieve automation capabilities that dramatically improve business results and increase the competitive advantage of our customers.
 
Human Emulation Enables Addressing Expansive Use Cases. Our RPA robots emulate human behavior and adapt to the ever-changing external variables of business. By having the robots emulate the usual business behavior of humans, companies can leverage our software to address a myriad of use cases, from simple to complex. We believe that the power of our software is only limited by the use cases that human users can come up with.
 
Built for Mid to Enterprise Deployment. Our software grows as our customers increase their automation operations across their organizations. Customers can deploy our software on desktops, on-premises, in public clouds, private clouds, or in hybrid environments. In addition, it can be deployed on multiple operating systems and across multiple devices. Our software is designed with security and governance at its core, allowing our customers to seamlessly expand the scope of automation while ensuring that IT departments have the security they need to automate.

Resilient Automations. Our software is capable of fully emulating the behavior of enterprise workers as they manipulate applications and systems to execute processes. Our robots can leverage our proprietary capabilities to fully emulate human behavior, interpreting a very wide variety of document types and adapting and responding to changes in the work environment. It can also adapt to changes in display resolution and scale, as well as user interface changes, by utilizing our proprietary OCR capabilities. For example, the process of scanning and importing postal invoices does not require the user to memorize the format of each invoice, and a single template can be used for all types of invoices. In addition, we have developed a variety of features to enable elasticity in the process and execution of automation. For example, when testing the user interface of a website, our software can create the same state as a human being browsing the site and perform operational validation tests. It also allows for management, reuse and reliability of user interface elements. Thanks to this feature, when changes are made to the application, the operation can continue without having to update the robot. With such flexibility, robots demonstrate their resilience in automating tasks and reducing the number of errors across the enterprise.
 
Integrated and Portable Object API Models. Our customers can reuse our object-oriented robots. This capability allows them to extend the capabilities of our software and improve automation results. Our software makes it easy to deploy, manage, and improve objects built by customers and third parties, allowing you to allocate more human resources to business problems and use cases. objects are designed to be deployed and customized once created.
 
Automation Performance and Business Outcome Analytics. Our software enables customers to gain powerful insights and generate key performance indicators with actionable metrics by tracking, measuring, and predicting automation performance through the use of a Robot Automation Portal. Out-of-the-box dashboards display execution metrics and allow users to measure performance and report on the value of their automation.
 
Built for Collaboration with Human and Robot. Our software is designed to allow humans and robots to work together, so that each can focus on the tasks they do best. Robots can perform time-consuming, repetitive, and routine tasks that make work less interesting and satisfying, while humans can focus on more creative thinking, innovation, solving complex problems, and improving the customer experience. Our software allows our customers to harness the power of automation to create fully automated, highly efficient enterprises where humans and robots work in harmony.
 
Accelerating the Adoption of Automation within the Enterprise. The adoption of our software will automate simple, duplicative, repetitive and time-consuming tasks in the organization that are not interesting to people, thus allowing them to focus on creative and rewarding tasks. Most of our clients use our solutions to find and automate all the tasks that can be automated in their companies. Our solution works with your employees to evaluate and score high-value automation possibilities. As employees become more comfortable with automation, they will more easily adopt and implement it, discover new processes to automate within a particular, and provide new automation ideas to RPA for development and deployment. After a few iterations of this kind of behavior, a phenomenon occurs in which certain employees build useful automation on their own, which is then deployed throughout the organization. This action is different from the automation that has been discovered so far and contributes to further operational efficiency. It helps to organically surface a number of automation ideas that could not be achieved with the traditional top-down approach.
 
Our Growth Strategies
 
Customer Experience Management Business
 
The key elements to our growth strategy for our customer experience management business are:
 
Grow Our Customer Base. The market for our CXM Platform is large and underserved. Mid-market businesses are particularly underserved by existing point application vendors and often lack sufficient resources to implement complex solutions. Our all-in-one CXM Platform allows mid-market businesses to efficiently adopt and execute an effective inbound marketing, sales, customer service, and content management strategy to help them expand and grow. We will continue to leverage our inbound go-to-market approach, freemium pricing strategy and our network of solutions partners to keep growing our business.

Increase Revenue from Existing Customers. With 903 total customers from our combined business units in Japan as of December 31, 2022, we believe we have a significant opportunity to increase revenue from our existing customers. We plan to increase revenue from our existing customers by expanding their use of our CXM Platform by upselling additional offerings and features, adding additional users, and cross-selling our marketing, sales, service, and content management products to existing customers through touchless or low touch in-product purchases. Our scalable pricing model allows us to capture more spend as our customers grow, increase the number of their customers and prospects managed on our CXM Platform, and offer additional functionality available from our higher price tiers and add-ons, providing us with a substantial opportunity to increase the lifetime value of our customer relationships.
 
Keep Expanding Internationally. We intend to grow our presence in international market through additional investments in local sales, marketing and professional service capabilities, as well as by leveraging our solutions partner network. We plan to open international offices. We have significant website traffic from regions outside the United States, and we believe that markets outside the United States represent a significant growth opportunity.
 
Continue to Innovate and Expand Our CXM Platform. Mid-market businesses are increasingly realizing the value of having an integrated marketing, sales, customer service, and content management platform. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity by introducing new products and applications to extend the functionality of our CXM Platform.
 
Selectively Pursue Acquisitions. We plan to selectively pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies and teams that would allow us to add new features and functionalities to our platform and accelerate the pace of our innovation.
 
Digital Transformation Business
 
For our digital transformation business, we are pursuing a large market opportunity with growth strategies that include:
 
Acquire New Customers. Our market is rapidly growing. We believe that as more organizations adopt our automation software and experience quantifiable competitive advantages, other organizations will also adopt automation as a necessary tool to compete. While we sell to organizations of all sizes and across a broad range of industries, our go-to-market team’s key focus is on the largest organizations, including large enterprises and governments. We also use an inside sales team focused on small and mid-sized businesses. We plan to continue to invest in our go-to-market team to grow our customer base both domestically and internationally.
 
Expand Within Our Existing Customer Base. Our customer base represents a significant opportunity for us to become a strategic partner to our customers in their automation journeys and drive further sales expansion through the following vectors:
 

● | deploy more software robots across different departments; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------
● | provide more employees with their own robot assistants; 
● | increase adoption of software products; and 
● | expand use cases for automation in the organization. 

 
Over time, we seek to deploy our solution where every employee interacts with multiple robots. We believe we will be able to accomplish this through our continued democratization of automation and enablement of citizen developers. 
 
Grow and Cultivate Our Partner and Channel Network. We are focused on maintaining and growing our ecosystem of partners that build, train, and certify skills on our technology as well as deploy our technology on behalf of their customers. We have built a global partner ecosystem of more than 40 systems integrators, value-added resellers, business consultants, technology partners, and public cloud vendors. Our partner network includes, among others, content management systems, customer experience management systems, Heartcore Robo (RPA), Apromore, myInvenio and Controlio. We intend to continue to expand and enhance our partner relationships to grow our market presence and drive greater sales efficiencies.

Extend Our Technology Leadership Through Continued Innovation and Investment in Our Software. We believe that we have built a differentiated automation software and intend to continually increase the value we provide to our customers by investing in extending the capabilities of our software. For example, we have introduced over four new products and multiple new features over the last 24 months. We have made and will continue to make significant investments in research and development to bolster our existing technology and enhance usability to improve our customers’ productivity.
 
Foster the Next Generation of Workers and Grow Our Community. We have built an extensive ecosystem focused on training and supporting individuals on working with our software. We have created forums addressing automation in the workplace and learning plans for all the important roles in automation. We believe automation will be a foundation of the future of work and, as individuals build out their skillsets, this will drive greater adoption of our software.
 
Continue to Invest in Major Markets. Since inception, we have invested in developing an infrastructure that would allow us to scale globally. We continue seeing adoption of our products across all geographies in which we operate and believe we have a significant runway ahead of us. We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand use of our software in the top 25 countries as measured by gross domestic product. As of December 31, 2022, sales to customers located in such countries represented 100% of our total annualized renewal run-rate. We intend to continue to make significant investments to expand our sales and drive adoption of our software throughout those markets. In particular, we believe that North America represents a significant opportunity for us, and we intend on continuing to expand our sales and drive adoption of our software across the region. As of December 31, 2022, customers located in the United States represented 0% of our total annualized renewal run-rate.
 
Opportunistically Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We will evaluate acquisition opportunities that we believe will be complementary to our existing software, enhance our technology, and increase the value proposition we deliver to our customers.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Intellectual property rights are important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual protections, to protect our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how, and brand.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we held one issued patent in Japan. Our issued patent is scheduled to expire between October 2028 and January 2030. As of December 31, 2022, we held one pending U.S. trademark application, and more than two active foreign trademark filings. As of December 31, 2022, we held two domain names in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess and identify the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.
 
The terms of individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a country-to-country basis and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 
Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, development of new services, features, and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our software are equally essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.

We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. We require our employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and we control and monitor access to our software, documentation, proprietary technology, and other confidential information. Our policy is to require all employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, processes, and other intellectual property generated by them on our behalf and under which they agree to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our customers and partners.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology. In addition, we intend to continue to expand our international operations, and effective intellectual property, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.
 
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
 
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The pandemic, which has continued to spread, and the related adverse public health developments, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions, and mandated business closures, have adversely affected workforces, organizations, customers, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn and increased market volatility. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses, including ours.
 
For example, many cities, counties, states, and even countries have imposed or may impose a wide range of restrictions on the physical movement of our employees, partners and customers to limit the spread of the pandemic, including physical distancing, travel bans and restrictions, closure of non-essential business, quarantines, work-from-home directives, shelter-in-place orders, and limitations on public gatherings. These measures have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide. In March 2020, we temporarily closed our offices, including our corporate headquarters, suspended all company-related travel, and all HeartCore Co. employees were required to work from home for several months during the height of the pandemic. We cancelled or shifted our customer and industry events to virtual-only experiences. Although we have begun to slowly re-open our offices on a staggered, region-by-region basis in accordance with local authority guidelines, we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. All of these changes may disrupt the way we operate our business. In addition, our management team has, and will likely continue, to spend significant time, attention and resources monitoring the pandemic and seeking to minimize the risk of the virus and manage its effects on our business and workforce.
 
Although our company has been in existence for less than two years, our wholly owned operating subsidiary, HeartCore Co. operated throughout the pandemic and continues to operate after the pandemic. HeartCore Co.’s business is affected by a variety of external factors related to the pandemic and post-pandemic that are beyond our control. For existing customers, the pandemic had no impact on the use of our software; for new customers in the travel, hotel, airline, rail, and food service industries in the CX division, the pandemic resulted in a decrease in new orders. However, although the pandemic is coming to an end, it will take some time before the economy is fully normalized. This results in even lower sales in 2022 than in 2021. Regarding the impact of the pandemic on the DX sector, demand for our DX software increased as large companies were forced to change their work patterns, forcing employees to work remotely. In 2022, after the pandemic, a number of employees left the company, forcing the company to downsize its operations and resulted in a decline in sales. During 2022, we started the GO IPO business, which supports Japanese companies to list on Nasdaq and NYSE in the United States. As of March 30, 2023, we have entered into consulting agreements with nine companies to assist them in their IPO process, whereby we are entitled to receive from each company a consulting fee ranges from $350,000 to $900,000 and warrants or Japanese acquisition rights to purchase one to four percent of the fully-diluted share capital of such companies that is exercisable on certain dates at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The revenue in the GO IPO business helped to offset the decline in sales in the CX and DX divisions.

The duration and extent of the impact from the pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions and the disruption caused by such actions, the effectiveness of vaccines and other treatments for COVID-19, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners and vendors. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be harmed.
 
To the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the “Risk Factors” section, including, in particular, risks related to our dependence on customer renewals, the addition of new customers and increased revenue from existing customer, risks that our operating results could be negatively affected by changes in the sizes or types of businesses that purchase our platform and the risk that weakened global economic conditions may harm our industry, business and results of operations.
 
Corporate History

Employees and Human Capital Management
 
Helping millions of organizations grow better requires a truly remarkable team. We are passionate about building a company culture where people can do their best work. Our company culture and our people are not just human resources priorities but critical business priorities. As a result, we consistently focus on how we can continue to help employees grow, both personally and professionally.
 
Since 2009, we have expanded beyond our Japanese headquarters to several offices globally and have built a large remote community. Currently, we are operating primarily from our office in Japan. As of December 31, 2022, we had 49 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 

● | Culture and Values. Our culture is built on the firm belief that personal and professional growth is just as important as business growth. We believe the best people do not only fit our culture, they further it.

We have prioritized employee safety and transparency during the pandemic and continue to do so, ensuring all employees are set up to work remotely and providing clarity on office closures and evolving guidelines, where possible. In the third quarter of 2020, we made the decision to permanently move to a hybrid workplace model, which means that as of January 1, 2021, our employees have the option to be fully remote, work full-time from one of our offices, or have the flexibility to work between office and remotely. This move provides our employees with continued flexibility, following the pandemic, to work in person, remotely, or in a hybrid model. This will enable us to grow better in serving our customers.

Government Regulation
 
Our business is and will continue to be subject to extensive U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations involving privacy, data protection, security, intellectual property, competition, taxation, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, and other similar laws. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and these laws and regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations are high and likely to increase in the future. Further, the impact of these laws and regulations may disproportionately affect our business in comparison to our competitors that have greater resources.
 
In the United States, we are subject to data security and privacy rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), and other state and federal laws relating to privacy and data security. The CCPA requires covered businesses to provide new disclosures to California residents and to provide them new ways to opt-out of the sale of personal information, and provides a private right of action and statutory damages for data breaches. Other jurisdictions in the United States are beginning to propose laws similar to the CCPA.
 
As a result of our international operations, we must comply with a multitude of data security and privacy laws that may vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established or is in the process of establishing data security and privacy legal frameworks with which we or our customers must comply. Our failure to comply with the laws of each jurisdiction may subject us to significant penalties. For example, the data protection landscape in Europe, including with respect to cross-border data transfers, is currently unstable and other countries outside of Europe have enacted or are considering enacting cross-border data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. We are not presently a party to any litigation the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. Defending such proceedings is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.
