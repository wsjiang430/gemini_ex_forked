Overview
We are a clinical stage biotechnology company developing a novel approach to immunotherapy designed to employ the body’s own T cells to generate an antigen-specific cell-mediated immune response with curative potential for the patient.
The backbone of our approach is our proprietary Artificial Immune Modulation, or AIMTM, nanoparticle technology platform. The AIM technology enables the rational construction of nanoparticles, or artificial antigen presenting cells, that function as synthetic dendritic cells. Like natural dendritic cells, the AIM nanoparticles employ natural signaling proteins, antigen presentation and co-stimulation, to deliver precise instructions to specific T cells directing a desired immune response.
We believe this is a revolutionary approach to directing antigen-specific T cell function specific to each disease, with several key advantages over other technologies.  Our platform is designed to:
•Deliver either “upregulatory” or “downregulatory” messages to targeted T cells (or T cell populations) to direct an antigen-specific therapeutic response without impairing healthy tissue or immune function. The artificial antigen-presenting cell, or aAPC, nanoparticle employing the activating co-stimulatory signal is used to activate and expand antigen-specific T cells that are intended to fight cancers and infectious diseases. The aAPC nanoparticle constructed with a suppressor or apoptotic co-stimulatory signal is intended to engage or suppress antigen specific autoreactive T cells to treat autoimmune diseases.
•Simultaneously target T cells directed at multiple antigens in a single product. We believe this is critical for addressing tumor escape mechanisms in cancer resulting in a durable response or for addressing diverse populations of autoreactive T cells.
•Be an “off-the-shelf” injectable product which creates substantial new benefits in terms of ability to scale and commercialize T cell targeting therapies, with advantages in cost, reimbursement, logistics, administration and time to patient delivery. Additionally, this modality unlocks significant potential in autoimmune applications. Taken together, this enables products based on the AIM technology as a way to reach broader populations more effectively than other T cell therapies.
This technology was originally developed at Johns Hopkins University. It has been further developed and optimized by NexImmune following its formation in 2011. The technology translates into two product modalities that include multi-antigen targeted adoptive cell therapies and multi-antigen targeted injectable off the shelf products. The most advanced programs, NEXI-001 and NEXI-002, are adoptive cell therapies which are currently in Phase 1/II trials. Importantly, these two modalities share the same mechanism of action in engaging and directing the function of antigen specific T cells. 
Scientific Context
Directing antigen-specific immune responses is one of the top priorities in immunology. It has been demonstrated by multiple modalities ways that harnessing the power of the immune system can be a powerful factor in fighting cancers, infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. While advances have been made, new modalities are needed to accelerate progress.
The search for a way to successfully amplify the potential benefits of antigen-specific therapies without impacting the broader immune system has gone on for many years, if not decades.
Some of the greatest progress has been in blood cancers, where novel technologies like CAR-Ts and bi-specific T cell engagers (BiTEs) have been able to target well-characterized surface antigen targets, like CD-19 or BCMA with several approved modalities. However, opportunities remain to address tumor escape, durability as well as significant toxicity and scale-up issues, particularly in the case of autologous cell therapies. In solid tumors, checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) such as PD-L1 and CTLA-4 antibodies are considered the most significant breakthrough in immune-oncology and are well-established in many indications as the standard of care. Yet achieving the next wave of immuno-therapy breakthroughs in solid tumors has been challenging, with a lack of progress in “I/O-I/O combinations”. Increasing the numbers effective tumor-specific T cells to clear tumors, establishing immunologic memory combined with broad scalability remain challenges.
In autoimmune disorders, these learnings from oncology are now being applied to create new possibilities for immune-based treatment. Like in solid tumors, most treatments are systemic (e.g., TNF or CD20 antibodies) and not antigen-specific for the disease in question. The emerging opportunity is to target the antigen specific autoreactive T cells directly and leave healthy tissue alone.
The AIMTM Platform
The AIM technology enables the rational construction of nanoparticles that function as synthetic dendritic cells. These synthetic dendritic cells interact with specific populations of T cells (defined both by antigen specificity and phenotype specificity) to direct a specific T cell function. Typically, this is either a message of activation or suppression.
The following graphic illustrates the critical parts and functions of the nanoparticle (the core and conjugated proteins) as well as the relative size of the nanoparticle to a T cell:
We believe that one of the critical advantages of the AIM technology platform is the modular design enabling the ability to rapidly customize it for new therapeutics. We have developed a rapid antigen peptide loading method that can be used to create new potential products with different antigen targets in months. Some of our collaborations, such as with the target-identifying AI company Zephyr, highlight the potential to validate targets and create therapeutics. We have also developed protein conjugation techniques so that nanoparticles can be customized quickly for different therapeutic goals by changing core materials, Signal 1(HLA alleles) and Signal 2 messages. It is even possible to add additional signals or homing proteins. This gives the platform tremendous flexibility and application.
One of the most significant points of flexibility is that this nanoparticle platform can be used for two therapeutic modalities creating ex vivo adoptive cell therapy products or directly-injectable, off-the-shelf, in vivo T cell therapy products. We call the adoptive cell therapy modality AIM ACT, and the direct-injectable off-the-shelf modality AIM INJ. Both modalities share the same mechanism of action in engaging and directing antigen specific T cell responses. 
We have two programs currently in clinical trials using the AIM ACT modality: NEXI-001 in acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, patients that have relapsed post allo-stem cell transplant, and NEXI-002 in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, or MM, both with potential to move into earlier diseases (lower tumor burden) and combine with emerging SOC in select patient populations. Both these clinical trials have been paused due to resource constraints, but the available data is reviewed in the “Preliminary Data” sections of the product reviews below and we expect to be able to provide the full data sets from these trials around an upcoming conference in 2023. Assuming successful final results from these Phase I/II clinical trials, we expect to discuss with the U.S. Federal Drug Administration, or the FDA, plans to progress both programs into registration trials designed to support potential approval of both product candidates in the United States. In parallel, we plan to explore partnering opportunities for further clinical development and, if approved, commercialization in these indications. While our first AIM 
ACT program in solid tumors, NEXI-003 (HPV-related malignancies), has also been paused due to resource constraints we are evaluating the potential to advance our HPV strategy using the AIM INJ modality.
The AIM INJ modality is a next-generation opportunity to revolutionize multi-antigen-specific T cell therapy. Because we are injecting our antigen-peptide-loaded nanoparticles directly into the body, our products are customizable and off-the-shelf. Importantly, we can deliver up-regulatory or down-regulatory instructions directly to targeted T cells (or T cell populations) regardless of host dendritic cell function without impairing healthy tissue or immune function. With the consistent ability to target multiple antigens in a single product, there is powerful potential to change the course of treatment in oncology, infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. We are currently in preclinical development of this technology in multiple diseases (see Pipeline section below) but expect to progress these technologies into clinical trials.
Our ability to engineer AIM nanoparticles using our platform is expected to also enable rapid new multi-antigen product development. Our nanoparticles are manufactured “unloaded,” meaning that while the Signal 1 and Signal 2 proteins are conjugated to the nanoparticle, the specific antigen peptides are not yet loaded into the HLA molecules. The nanoparticles in this form can be stored for significant periods of time. Then, when antigen peptide targets have been identified and validated, they are "”loaded”, a process that takes hours. The nanoparticle can then be vialed and is ready for delivery to the patient. Effectively, this means that the time to product creation depends only on the time to identify and produce the relatively simple antigen-specific peptide (or mix of peptides for multiple targets). This can reduce the time for new multi-antigen-specific product development from years to months. The AIM nanoparticles themselves can be used as a preclinical tool for target validation to expedite the process.
In summary, our AIM nanoparticle technology is designed to bypass the dendritic cells and deliver the right kind of instructions directly to T cells using natural biology. In essence, we create nano-sized synthetic dendritic cells. These nano-sized synthetic dendritic cells are designed to deliver precise instructions to a specific set of targeted T cells, and these instructions will be different depending on the therapeutic goal. 
Our Pipeline
Our pipeline consists of programs using both the AIM ACT and AIM INJ modality.
We have two product candidates in human clinical trials, NEXI-001 in patients with AML and NEXI-002 in patients with MM. Both of these programs are in Phase I/II trials. Enrollment is both of these programs is currently paused for resource reasons, with a discussion of the available data below.
As Phase I/II trials, the trials consist of two parts. In the first part of the trials, the initial safety evaluation phase, we will assess the safety and tolerability of NEXI-001 or NEXI-002 T cells. In the second part of the trials, the expansion phase, we will further define safety and will also evaluate the initial efficacy of each product candidate at the dose and regimen established in the safety evaluation phase. We have completed enrollment and dosing of patients in the safety evaluation phase of the trial for NEXI-001 and NEXI-002, and we expect to be able to provide the full data sets from these trials in the first half of 2023.
Our next adoptive cell therapy product candidate, NEXI-003, is our first product candidate targeted at solid tumors. The IND has been accepted by the FDA, but this program has also been paused due to resource constraints.
We have combined the learning from our adoptive cell therapies and INJ pre-clinical efforts which include: 
1. Ability to expand healthy, fit, antigen-specific T cells from late-stage, heavily pre-treated patients providing insight into the potential to activate healthy, fit, specific T cells in vivo. 
2. AIM nanoparticles expand antigen-specific T cells with important subtypes known to be associated with anti-tumor activity and immunologic memory regardless of modality or stage. 
3. AIM nanoparticle-expanded T cells proliferate, traffic to tumor site and persist.
4. No obvious off-tissue toxicity.
5. Potential synergistic effects when combining AIM-activated antigen-specific T cells with other IO mechanisms suggesting a increased durable response.
We have completed substantial non-clinical work to advance the AIM INJ modality towards a potential investigational new drug application, or IND, filing, including preparing appropriate IND-enabling experiments in support of a planned clinical program focusing on solid tumors. Subject to regulatory feedback and an IND filing, we anticipate a second clinical program that would target autoimmune disease and which would be the first AIM product candidate to suppress, rather than activate, T cell function. In support of this potential program, we have generated and published pre-clinical data in which we observed that AIM nanoparticles engaged and suppressed auto-reactive T cells.
Additionally, we are developing the AIM platform for potential clinical application in patients suffering from specific infectious disease. In non-clinical studies, we have been able to expand CD8+ T cells directed against viral antigens including Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Human Papillomavirus.
The following table summarizes our pipeline as well as many of our key collaborators:

Our Approach
Our approach to immunotherapy employs the body’s own T cells and is designed to generate a specific, potent and durable immune response that mimics natural biology. We believe the key attributes of this platform are:
•Ability to target specific T cell populations. The AIM nanoparticles are programmed to be antigen-specific. That antigen can either be on the T cell itself (in the case of autoreactive T cells) or on a target cell (in the case of oncology or infectious diseases). Importantly, this means that the activation or suppression message is NOT delivered to other cells. The message is for a particular T cell only and does not impact healthy tissue or benign cells. Other T cell technologies can be specific to particular antigens (e.g., CAR-T or TCR therapies), but they cannot also deliver the other major benefits listed here.
•Ability to target multiple T cell populations simultaneously. While a single AIM nanoparticle is directed at a single antigen, it is preferred to mix nanoparticles targeted at different antigens into a nanoparticle cocktail for administration and use, thereby creating a product which can address multiple targets at the same time. Our current clinical programs target five (5) antigens simultaneously, but we have tested higher numbers successfully. This ability to target multiple antigens simultaneously is a powerful tool against tumor escape in oncology, as well as a practical approach to addressing diverse autoreactive T cell populations in autoimmune disorders.
•No genetic engineering. The AIM technology works by delivering natural signaling to T cells from the natural repertoire. In ACT, there is no need to genetically alter the T cell offering a more streamline manufacturing process and potential for improved tolerability as a cell therapy. As an INJ therapy, no patient specific manufacturing is required. This has clear benefits for cost, simplicity, and scalability.
•“Off-the-shelf” manufacturing and administration. The AIM INJ modality is scalable and simple to administer. Nanoparticles can be manufactured ahead of time and stored, enabling a significant cost and scalability advantage over most other T cell therapies.
•Rapid new product development. In addition to these core principles of differentiation, we believe the modular design of the AIM platform facilitates the rapid design of new product candidates based on synergies derived from interchangeable components, specifically antigen peptides, signaling proteins and core material, as well as shared methods for nanoparticle construction, protein conjugation, peptide loading, and a platform manufacturing system for T cell therapy products. Specifically, we can customize and load new sets of antigen targets and signaling proteins to efficiently create new products for new indications and new therapeutic areas. Rather than having to create a fully-new biologic molecule, like an antibody, against the target, the peptides can simply be loaded onto the nanoparticles for immediate testing.
While there are many technology platforms and product candidates in development across the biotechnology industry focused on influencing T cell activity, there is no platform that can deliver this combination of attributes besides the AIM platform.
Our Strategy
Our mission is to create therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer and other life-threatening immune-mediated diseases. We believe that in the long term, our AIM technology has the potential to be a core component of many immunotherapy combinations used to treat a variety of immune-mediated diseases. Our ultimate goal is to develop and bring to patients, independently or working with partners, a portfolio of off-the-shelf T cell products with specific application to a wide range of cancers, autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases.
Key elements of our strategy include:
•Advance the AIM INJ program candidates into clinical trials. We believe that one of the most significant advantages presented by our AIM technology is the potential for an “off-the-shelf,” injectable form of the AIM nanoparticle. Our first program is likely to be in oncology, and our next program likely in the autoimmune disorder space. The specific timing for the start of the clinical trials will depend on resource availability but the development of the AIM INJ product candidates remains our top priority.
•Advance NEXI-001 and NEXI-002 to registrational trials. While enrollment in both these programs is currently paused due to resource constraints, we have been generating meaningful proof-of-concept data in both safety and efficacy. Life Cycle Development Plans to move into earlier lines of therapy and evaluate novel IO/IO combinations in specific populations based on emerging pre-clinical data have also been paused.
•Drive forward NEXI-003, our first solid tumor product candidate. Our first solid tumor product candidate, NEXI-003 represents a powerful new expansion of the capability and utility of the AIM platform to advance potential IO/IO breakthroughs. Also, given the large number of potential antigen combinations in solid tumors, we expect licensing and partnerships to be a core element of our strategy as we establish the broader applicability of our AIM technology.
•Leverage partnerships to drive new product development in autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases. The AIM INJ modality will be constructed to deliver either “suppressive” or “apoptotic” co-stimulation signals directly to auto-reactive T cell populations, which is critical for addressing autoimmune disorders. In addition to autoimmune disorders, we believe that there may be significant opportunities to address virally-mediated infectious diseases via either the AIM ACT or AIM INJ modality. We also believe that the AIM technology may be applicable to the treatment of, and preparation for, future virally-mediated epidemics and pandemics. While we believe that our AIM technology platform is well-suited to address these new therapeutic opportunities, we expect that we would partner with experienced biopharmaceutical companies with deep capabilities in these areas to advance new therapies in these potential indications. Our collaboration with Yale University in Type 1 Diabetes is an example of the kinds of partnerships we will establish to help drive this technology forward for patients.
While we intend to establish our own internal capabilities to develop and commercialize our product candidates, we will also explore strategic collaborations or partnerships that may accelerate our development timelines, broaden the therapeutic reach of our AIM technology platforms and maximize the full potential of both the AIM ACT and AIM INJ modalities.
Our Clinical-Stage Product Candidates
We have two programs in clinical trials: NEXI-001 for AML patients and NEXI-002 for MM patients, with enrollment in both currently paused due to resource constraints.
NEXI-001
NEXI-001 is an allogeneic cell therapy in Phase I/II development for the treatment of patients with AML who have relapsed disease after receiving allo-HSCT. Allo-HSCT is currently the only therapeutic procedure with established curative potential for intermediate and high risk AML patients. However, of the approximately 20,000 patients diagnosed with AML in the United States in 2019, approximately 50% were young or healthy enough to qualify for allo-HSCT. Of those patients who do receive allo-HSCT, fewer than half are cured. Patients who relapse after allo-HSCT face a dismal prognosis and are left with very limited treatment options. Most will succumb to their disease within one year of relapse and the two-year survival rate is less than 15%. Many of these patients fail to respond to further salvage treatments with an even worse prognosis. 
Treatment Paradigm for AML
While there are currently no approved therapies for this relapsed patient population, donor lymphocyte infusion, or DLI, is employed as the standard-of-care treatment. DLI is a procedure in which non-selected and non-disease specific T cells are collected from an AML patient’s original stem cell donor by apheresis. The T cells are then infused directly into the AML patient with the hope that some populations of the infused T cells will recognize and kill the patient’s leukemia cells, directing a graft versus leukemia, or GvL, effect. Unfortunately, this blunt approach works in only approximately 15% to 20% of patients. Making matters worse, approximately 50% to 60% of patients that receive DLI therapy experience life-threatening toxicities associated with non-leukemia specific T cells from the donor attacking healthy cells in the patient, a condition referred to as Graft Versus Host Disease, or GvHD. Currently, there is no way for a treating physician to “de-couple” the benefits of GvL from the toxicities of GvHD. They are not able to separate the “good” T cells from the “bad.” Because each NEXI-001 infusion contains high proportions of T cells that are directed to specifically recognize and attack only a patient’s leukemia cells and are comprised of very few T cell subtypes capable of eliciting a GvHD response, we believe therapy with NEXI-001 offers the potential to enhance the benefits of GvL while significantly reducing the risk of GvHD.
Our AIM technology is used to produce the NEXI-001 product candidate. As illustrated in the graphic below, AIM nanoparticles are loaded with AML-specific peptides from the WT 1, PRAME and Cyclin A1 antigens, which are used to enrich and expand AML-specific T cells. These AML-specific T cells recognize and attack these specific antigen peptide targets, which are commonly over-expressed on both leukemic blasts and leukemic stem cells
The T cells in NEXI-001 are designed to be highly potent and highly selective in their ability to distinguish leukemia cells from healthy cells, and to contain key T cell subtypes that promote immunologic memory and long-term T cell persistence. We believe this combination of attributes has the potential to deliver deep and durable clinical responses for these AML patients.
Phase I/II Clinical Trial Design
Our clinical trial with NEXI-001 is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalating Phase I/II trial that aims to enroll between 22 and 26 patients. The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of a single infusion of NEXI-001 T cells in patients with AML who have either minimum residual disease, or MRD, or morphologically detectable disease after an HLA-matched allo-HSCT. As a practical point, the NEXI-001 trial enrolls patients who have not achieved a remission to salvage therapy after relapse following the transplant. Secondary objectives include signals of immunologic responses and preliminary anti-tumor activity, including evaluations of the following clinical endpoints: overall response rate, or ORR, which includes complete response, or CR, progression free survival, or PFS, and overall survival, or OS. Additional analysis will assess the in vivo persistence, proliferation, functionality and TCR repertoire of NEXI-001 T cells as measured in blood and bone marrow samples. Our clinical endpoints have been recognized as appropriate measurements of safety and clinical response.
This trial consists of two parts. The initial safety evaluation phase assesses the safety and tolerability of a single infusion of NEXI-001 at escalating dose levels. In the second part of the trial, the dose expansion phase, investigators further characterize safety and will also evaluate the initial efficacy of NEXI-001 T cells at the dose established in the safety evaluation phase. Once the recommended dose and regimen have been determined, evaluations of safety, tolerability and initial clinical response will become the objectives of the second part of the trial, the expansion phase. We are currently in the safety evaluation phase of the trial. The City of Hope Cancer Center is the lead clinical trial site for this trial, with additional trial sites at the Dana Farber Cancer Center, the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Karmanos Cancer Institute, the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the Advent Hospital in Orlando, Florida.
 The schema for this trial (and current enrollment) is shown below:
Preliminary Data from the Phase I/II Clinical Trial
At this point, we have completed enrollment and dosing in the dose escalation phase, with a total enrollment of 11 patients. We have reported data from six patients across Dose Level 1, Dose Level 2 and Dose Level 3 safety cohorts to date. We are still collecting data from existing patients and that data will be shared at an appropriate scientific forum.
Each of these patients has been closely monitored for safety and early signs of clinical activity. In addition, biomarkers were analyzed to assess early signs of immunologic response; clinical lab reports and patient charts were used to measure myeloid activity (neutrophils counts, platelet counts, Red Blood Cell counts, transfusion burden); and validated clinical endpoints were incorporated to measure early signs of clinical activity. It is important to note that we are early in the safety evaluation and dose-finding part of the Phase I/II trial, and that the results reported here represent data from the first five patients only and are not statistically significant. Additional data from all safety cohorts is expected to be announced in 2023.
Safety and tolerability. The NEXI-001 therapy has been well tolerated without dose limiting toxicities, observed after a single infusion of NEXI-001 T cells at doses of 50M, 100M and 200M total T cells. This includes no > grade 3 cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, or ICANS, or infusion-related reactions, or IRRs at any Grade Level (Grade 1-4).
Immunological responses.In the first six patients, treated we have observed initial indicators of immunologic response after the infusion of NEXI-001 T cells, including (i) early lymphocyte reconstitution to baseline levels after administration of lymphodepleting therapy with rapid and robust recovery of the CD4+ T cell compartment; (ii) the proliferation and persistence of NEXI-001 antigen-specific T cells as measured by multimer-staining of peripheral blood when adequate samples were available for analysis; (iii) clonal expansion and persistence of NEXI-001 T cells in both peripheral blood and bone marrow as measured by TCR sequencing when data was available; and (iv) the presence of T cell subtypes that support anti-tumor activity, T cell proliferation, self-renewal and long-term persistence as measured by phenotype staining of NEXI-001 antigen-specific T cells in peripheral blood over time when adequate samples were available for analysis. It is important to note that we are early in the safety evaluation and dose-finding part of the Phase I/II trial, and that these results are not statistically significant.
Patient Characteristics
Summary of Patient Experience
As discussed above, we have reported clinical data in six patients for NEXI-001’s initial clinical trial. Importantly, this has been part of a dose-ascending clinical plan where the first patient received a single dose of 50M T cells, the next three patients received a single dose of 100M T cells, and the next patients received two doses of 200M cells after Day 30 for a total of 400M cells. The next and final planned dose level will be 200M cells administered weekly for three weeks, followed by a week of rest, followed by a repeat of the 200M cells administered weekly for three weeks, a total of 1.2 billion T cells.
The data from the initial dose levels reported to date is encouraging and supports progression into the higher doses. Specifically, we have observed:
NEXI-001 is well-tolerated.
•As previously described, there have been no grade ≥3 SAEs observed. One case of Grade 2 CRS was reported, which resolved within 24 hours.
NEXI-001 generates a robust immune response across all dose levels reported to date:
Rapid recovery of absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) following the pre-therapy lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen including reconstitution of both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subtypes, despite the fact that NEXI-001 contains CD8+ T cells only. Expansion and persistence of antigen-specific T cells in both the peripheral blood and bone marrow.
•The phenotypes of the antigen-specific T cells in the NEXI-001 product candidate, including stem-cell-like memory and central memory T cell populations, are maintained in blood and the bone marrow over time.
Signals of NEXI-001 of clinical activity across all dose levels reported to date: 
In particular, patients are seeing some or all of the following:
•Evidence of marrow recovery based on improved donor chimerism (i.e., granulocytes, T cells, bone marrow) and where relevant, reduced transfusion burden
•Improved ECOG performance.
•Evidence of reduced tumor burden based on decreases in peripheral blasts and a decrease in bone marrow blasts (in Dose Level 3). 
The following chart summarizes the clinical experience of the patients at the various dosing levels disclosed here: 
As described above, we have completed enrollment and dosing of patients in Dose Level 4. We are still collecting data on these patients and expect to share this data at an appropriate scientific forum. At this time, further enrollment is paused due to resource constraints.
NEXI-002
NEXI-002 is an autologous cell therapy in Phase I/II clinical development to treat patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM who have failed at least three prior lines of therapy. We have currently paused enrollment in this trial due to resource constraints. MM accounts for around 10% to 15% of all hematologic malignancies and primarily affects older individuals, with approximately 32,000 new cases a year in the United States. While significant progress has been made in the treatment of MM, there is currently no cure for the condition.
Treatment Paradigm for MM
There are currently several T cell therapies under clinical investigation for this patient population. Among them, anti-B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, transduced CAR T therapies have demonstrated early and impressive initial clinical results across multiple Phase II/III clinical trials, with objective responses rates, or ORR, greater than 90% in patients reported within some individual trials, and progression free survival, or PFS, rates of approximately 11 months. As clinical trial experience grows and initial data sets mature, certain and common limitations of these therapies are also becoming evident, with many directly attributable to the technology itself.
CAR T therapy, by design, uses an antibody to target a single protein, such as BCMA, expressed on the surface of a plasma cell. These surface proteins are not critical to the survival of the plasma cell and can be down-regulated when under immune pressure, such as from the CAR T cellular therapy. As a result, the tumor cell can avoid detection by the CAR T cell in a process known as tumor escape. We also believe that a primary driver of tumor relapse following CAR T therapy is the loss of CAR T cells from a patient’s body: the CAR T cells do not persist. Due to the way CAR T cells are manufactured, they contain highly potent T cells, but do not contain the natural T cell subtypes that support self-renewal, immunologic memory and long-term persistence. When the CAR T cells die out, the cancer can relapse.
NEXI-002 was designed to address these emerging limitations of CAR T therapy.
•Tumor escape. Each infusion of NEXI-002 contains populations of T cells directed to recognize and attack multiple antigen targets on each malignant plasma cell, as shown in the figure below. These targets represent a combination of cell surface antigen proteins, such as CS-1 and CD138, and endogenously presented survival antigen proteins, such as WT-1 and NY-ESO. We believe that by targeting multiple antigen proteins that are over-expressed on each malignant plasma cell, some of which are necessary for tumor cell survival, NEXI-002 has the potential to effectively address tumor escape as an immune evasion mechanism.
•Tumor relapse. The AIM technology has been optimized to consistently produce product candidates that contain T cell subtypes that support anti-tumor potency, self-renewal, immunologic memory and long-term T cell persistence. We believe the combination of these T cell characteristics has the potential to effectively address disease relapse due to short-term T cell survival.
When taken together, we believe these attributes of NEXI-002 give it the potential to improve the durability of clinical responses observed with current BCMA-transduced CAR T products, extend PFS rates and improve the toxicity profile reported to date when using these genetically engineered T cell modalities.
As with NEXI-001, our AIM technology is used to produce each NEXI-002 infusion. AIM nanoparticles loaded with MM-specific antigen peptides, enriched and expanded by the E+E system, generate populations of T cells that are directed to recognize and attack the specific antigen targets, as illustrated in the graphic below.
The T cells in each NEXI-002 infusion are designed to be highly potent and highly selective in their ability to distinguish malignant plasma cells from healthy plasma cells, and to contain key T cell subtypes that promote anti-tumor potency, immunologic memory and long-term T cell persistence. We believe this combination of attributes has the potential to deliver deep and durable clinical responses for MM patients who have failed at least three lines of prior therapy.
Phase I/II Clinical Trial Design
Our clinical trial with NEXI-002 is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalating Phase I/II clinical trial that aims to enroll between 19 and 23 patients. This trial consists of two phases. The initial safety evaluation phase assessed the safety and tolerability of a single infusion of NEXI-002 within a single dose range. In the second part of the trial, the expansion phase, investigators will further define safety and will also evaluate the initial efficacy of each product candidate at the dose established in the safety evaluation phase. We are currently in the expansion phase of the trial. The trial’s primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of a single infusion of NEXI-002 T cells in patients with MM who have failed at least three prior lines of therapy. Secondary objectives include signals of anti-tumor activity, ORR (which includes CR), OS and PFS. Additional biomarker analysis will assess the in vivo persistence, proliferation, functionality and TCR repertoire of NEXI-002 T cells as measured in blood and bone marrow samples. Our clinical endpoints have been recognized as appropriate measurements of safety and clinical response. The clinical trial sites include City of Hope Cancer Center, the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Karmanos Cancer Institute, the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Dana Farber Cancer Center, and the Advent Hospital in Orlando, Florida.
Preliminary Data from the Phase I/II Clinical Trial
Enrollment in this clinical trial has been paused with seven patients enrolled and dosed. We have reported data on a total of five patients, of which three patients were treated in the Safety Evaluation Phase and two patients were treated in the Expansion Phase. The remaining data is being collected and will be shared in an appropriate scientific forum.
Safety and tolerability. The NEXI-002 therapy has been well tolerated without dose limiting toxicities observed after a single infusion of NEXI-002 T. This includes no > grade 3 cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, or ICANS, or infusion-related reactions, or IRRs at any Grade Level (Grade 1-4).
Immunological responses. TCR sequencing showed that NEXI-002 product contains T cell clones that were undetectable in the peripheral blood of patients at baseline. The product contains CD8+ antigen specific T cells with memory phenotypes. Upon dosing, patients saw a rapid lymphocyte recovery with reconstitution of both CD4 and CD8+ T cells. NEXI-002 cells were detected in the peripheral blood and bone marrow and persist and proliferate over time. The quality and functionality of the NEXI-002 T cells is comparable to those expanded from healthy donors. Strategies to yield higher product doses have been implemented as the trial progresses and the NEXI-002 protocol has been amended to include patients with smoldering multiple myeloma (an early stage of multiple myeloma). Analyses of immunologic and clinical activity are ongoing. We expect to announce additional data in 2023.
Patient Characteristics
Summary of Patient Experience
Future Opportunities
Moving forward, our strategy is to focus on the development of the AIM INJ modality, with the expectation that we will be able to advance it through IND approval and into a Phase I/II clinical trial, resources permitting. We believe the data we have already collected is validating of the AIM platform’s mechanism, which gives us a favorable risk profile as we seek to establish the technology in solid tumors, infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. We have generated a significant body 
of combined clinical and non-clinical data to support this approach, which we use to prioritize our clinical development efforts and to identify potential disease areas and indications to pursue.
•Solid Tumors. Our IND for NEXI-003 in HPV-associated malignancies has been accepted by the FDA, but the planned Phase I/II clinical trial has been paused due to resource constraints. HPV-associated malignancies remains a disease area of high interest for the AIM INJ platform, and there are many more opportunities for the AIM technology in the solid tumor space. The scientific community has identified, robustly characterized and clinically evaluated over 75 specific antigen targets across multiple solid tumor types, and we plan to use this data to inform our next wave of product development in oncology. Additionally, combinations of multi-antigen specific AIM therapeutics with CPI’s remain a potential IO/IO breakthrough.
•Hematology (Blood Cancers). The AIM multi-antigen approach has the potential to pursue a broader set of targets to address escape and durability. Combined, early clinical data is consistent with pre-clinical results demonstrating antigen specific cells proliferate, traffic and persist at the site of tumor. Additionally, opportunity exists to move into earlier disease to halt progression. Recent pre-clinical data suggests potential novel IO/IO combinations with Bispecific T cell engagers (e.g. CD3/BCMA, CD3/Flt-3) offers the potential to achieve synergistic, superior potency and durability in select populations. 
•Autoimmune Disorders. We believe that our AIM technology will enable us to target autoimmune conditions using either the AIM ACT or AIM INJ modality. For most autoimmune disorders like Type 1 Diabetes, autoreactive (or self-destructive) T cells become the cells targeted for therapeutic intervention. For these conditions, AIM nanoparticles can be loaded with Signal 1 antigen peptides that autoreactive T cells recognize, and Signal 2 peptides that deliver a suppressive or apoptotic signal that either tolerizes or eliminates the disease-causing T cells. In conditions like multiple sclerosis, or MS, the Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, plays a critical role in mediating the disease process. Eliminating EBV-infected cells with EBV-specific T cells has been shown by others to impact disease progression for patients with Primary Progressive MS and could be done using the AIM ACT approach. We believe that EBV-specific AIM ACT or AIM INJ product candidates can be developed for clinical evaluation in various forms of MS.
•Infectious Diseases. We believe that there may be significant opportunities to address other viral-mediated diseases using the AIM platform to develop either AIM ACT or AIM INJ product candidates. We also believe that the AIM technology may offer a novel approach to the rapid treatment of, and preparation for, future viral-epidemics and pandemics.
•Expanding to new HLA allele subtype populations. We are also developing additional HLA allele subtypes. NEXI-001 and NEXI-002 currently use the HLA-A2 allele, which is the most prevalent allele in the North American population. However, the additional HLA subtypes we plan to develop, including HLA-A1, HLA-A3, HLA-A11, HLA-A24 and HLA-B7, would broaden the patient eligibility of future product candidates. We believe the modular AIM platform will facilitate the rapid development of nanoparticles that exchange the current HLA-A2 for new HLA subtypes, which will then be used for all AIM product candidates in development.
In addition, we continually survey the scientific and industry landscape for opportunities to license, partner or acquire technologies that may help us advance current or new T cell therapies for the benefit of patients.
Commercialization
Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused commercial organization in the United States to market, sell and distribute our products. We believe that such an organization can efficiently address the community of hematologists and oncologists who are the key specialists treating the patient populations for which our most advanced product candidates are being developed. Outside the United States, we expect to enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties to support any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval.
Given our potential to generate novel product candidates with potential to address a wide variety of cancers, autoimmune and infectious diseases, we may also consider opportunistically entering into strategic partnerships focused on certain targets, product candidates, disease areas or geographies. These collaborations could advance and accelerate our current clinical and platform development programs in ways that could maximize product availability and value creation.
Competition
We are initially developing product candidates to address hematological malignancies, which will be followed by an expansion into solid tumors, autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases. Accordingly, we may face competitors from multiple biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies, many of which have access to greater resources, technical expertise and broader collaborations that could result in faster development, exclusive access to novel enabling technologies, biomarker-based differentiation or commercialization. These competitors also compete for recruiting and retaining talent in critical areas of research, development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercial functions. If NEXI-001, NEXI-002 or any of our future product candidates do not offer sustainable advantages over competing products, we may not be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors.
The field of immuno-oncology is rapidly evolving, and we expect to compete with companies developing other approaches to direct T cell function. These include but are not limited to, the following modalities.
Genetically Engineered T Cells
These include both CAR-T and TCR engineered cell therapies being developed as treatments for MM and AML. CAR-T cell therapies generally target single cell surface antigen proteins and are mostly limited to blood tumors, including products and product candidates being developed at companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Novartis AG, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Fate Therapeutics, Inc. and Mustang Bio, Inc. We also expect to compete with TCR engineered cell therapies, which employ high affinity TCR’s against a single endogenously presented antigen peptide, including products and product candidates being developed by companies such as Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Immatics N.V.
Non-engineered T Cells
These are cell therapy approaches that employ the ex vivo activation and expansion of non-genetically engineered endogenous T cells, including TIL products, such as those being developed by Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc., and antigen presenting cell, or APC, based systems, ex vivo activation and expansion systems, such as those being developed by Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc. and Marker Therapeutics, Inc.
Cancer Vaccines
Cancer vaccine approaches rely on host antigen presenting cells as intermediaries to process and present specific signals that direct a targeted T cell function, including products and product candidates being developed at companies like SQZ Biotechnologies Company, BioNTech SE and Moderna, Inc.
Antibody Platforms
These modalities employ modified antibodies to redirect T cell function and include bispecific T cell engagers, or BiTEs, and dual-affinity re-targeting proteins, or DARTs, including products and product candidates being developed at companies like Amgen Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson and MacroGenics, Inc.
Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may, or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products. These competitors may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products.
Johns Hopkins License Agreement
In June 2011, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Johns Hopkins, which was subsequently amended and then superseded in January 2017 by an amended and restated exclusive license agreement, which we refer to as the A&R Johns Hopkins License Agreement. Pursuant to the A&R Johns Hopkins License Agreement, we have (i) an exclusive license to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale and sell artificial antigen presenting cells (AIM nanoparticles) covered by patent rights owned by Johns Hopkins in therapeutic, diagnostic and non-clinical fields, (ii) an exclusive license to make have made, use, import, offer for sale and sell fusion proteins covered by patent rights owned by Johns Hopkins in the therapeutic field, (iii) a non-exclusive license to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale and sell fusion proteins covered by patent rights owned by Johns Hopkins in diagnostic and non-clinical fields and (iv) a non-exclusive right to use Johns Hopkins’s know-how to develop, make, have made and sell products covered by patent rights owned by Johns Hopkins and to develop and provide services covered by the patent rights owned by Johns Hopkins. The rights licensed to us are worldwide and include the right to grant sublicenses.
Johns Hopkins retains rights to practice the patent rights and know-how for itself and other non-profit academic and non-profit research institutions for any non-profit, non-commercial research or other non-commercial purpose. The United States government may have a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States throughout the world the inventions described in the patent rights owned by Johns Hopkins that were supported by federal funding. We may be obligated to manufacture the products sold or used in the United States that are covered by patent rights supported by federal funding substantially in the United States.
Under the terms of the 2011 license agreement and the A&R Johns Hopkins License Agreement, Johns Hopkins was entitled to an up-front license fee of $155,000 and we issued them 26,918 shares of our common stock. Johns Hopkins was also entitled to milestone fees of $75,000 in connection with clinical trial milestones. For the first licensed product or licensed service in the therapeutic field, we may be required to pay Johns Hopkins additional aggregate milestone fees of $1.6 million for clinical and regulatory milestone fees. We may be required to pay Johns Hopkins reduced milestone fees for the second and third licensed products or licensed services in the therapeutic field in connection with clinical and regulatory milestones. In the diagnostic field, we may be required to pay Johns Hopkins aggregate milestone fees of $400,000 for the first licensed product or licensed service and reduced milestone fees for the second and third licensed products or licensed services. We may be required to pay Johns Hopkins aggregate milestone fees of $100,000 for commercial milestones for the first licensed product or licensed service in the non-clinical field. In the aggregate, we may be required to pay Johns Hopkins additional milestone fees of up to $4.2 million for all clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones for all licensed products or licensed services in the therapeutic field, the diagnostic field and the non-clinical field. We may also be required to pay royalties in the low to upper single digits on net sales of licensed products and licensed services in the therapeutic field, diagnostic field and non-clinical field that are covered by the patent rights owned by Johns Hopkins or use know-how of Johns Hopkins. We are required to make minimum annual royalty payments of $100,000 to Johns Hopkins for the remainder of the term of the A&R Johns Hopkins License Agreement; the amount of the minimum annual royalty payment started in the low five figures in the first year of the agreement and increased to $100,000 in the third year of the agreement and for each subsequent year of the agreement. We may also be required to pay Johns Hopkins a low double digit percentage, not to exceed 15%, of any non-royalty sublicense consideration we receive. We are also required to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet certain clinical and technical diligence milestones.
We must make minimum royalty payments, which began upon the 4th anniversary of the agreement and upon every anniversary thereafter during the term of the agreement, which offset future royalties per above owed to John Hopkins.
In the event Johns Hopkins or another party provides us with clinical or other evidence demonstrating the practicality of a particular market or use within the therapeutic, diagnostic or non-clinical fields that we are not developing or commercializing, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to start development or attempt to sublicense to a suitable third party for that particular market or use. If we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to commence development or do not grant a sublicense to a suitable third party, all rights to that particular use will revert back to Johns Hopkins at no cost and Johns Hopkins will be able to license that particular use to third parties. We are not required to cause development of any licensed product or licensed service for a particular market or use if we reasonably demonstrate to Johns Hopkins that developing such licensed products or licensed services or granting a sublicense for such market or use would a have a potentially adverse commercial effect upon licensed products or licensed services being developed or sold by us, our affiliates or our existing sublicensees.
Unless terminated earlier in accordance with the agreement, the A&R Johns Hopkins License Agreement and the royalty obligations thereunder will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product or licensed service-by-licensed service and country-by-country basis until the expiration date of the last-to-expire patent or, if no patents issue, until the tenth anniversary of the agreement, at which time the licenses will become fully paid up and royalty-free.
We or Johns Hopkins may terminate the A&R Johns Hopkins License Agreement if the other party files for insolvency or if there is an uncured breach of obligations or failure to perform by the other party. We may terminate the A&R Johns Hopkins License Agreement upon giving Johns Hopkins 90 days’ written notice.
Zephyr Joint Research Agreement
In March 2022, we entered into a Joint Research Agreement, or JRA, with Zephyr AI, Inc., or Zephyr, focused on the joint collaboration, identification and validation of certain targets in order to facilitate further research, development and potential commercialization of immunotherapies. Pursuant to the JRA , Zephyr will identify suitable antigens or combinations thereof for validation and testing by NexImmune. The Joint Steering Committee provided for by the JRA, or the JSC, will then determine which identified candidates shall be subject to further analysis. We will validate which, if any, of the identified antigens are suitable for T-cell engagement and killing function, which antigens are referred to as the Final Candidates. The JSC will make a good-faith determination as to whether the data supports the further IND-targeted development by us of any of the Final Candidates. We and Zephyr will jointly own any Final Candidates, including the intellectual property related thereto. Each of the company and Zephyr shall be responsible for payment of their own respective costs and expenses in connection with the performance of their respective obligations under the JRA. If a Final Candidate is to be further developed, then we and Zephyr shall engage in good-faith negotiations to agree on the terms and conditions of an agreement with respect to the further development and commercialization of such Final Candidate. If such an agreement is not executed within the prescribed negotiation period, then neither the we nor Zephyr may further develop such Final Candidate.
Each of the company and Zephyr can terminate the JRA (i) for any reason upon 90 days’ written notice, and (ii) upon the other’s breach or default of any of the terms and conditions thereof, subject to 30 days’ notice and cure period. Absent early termination or mutual extension, the JRA shall terminate two (2) years after the effective date.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our patents and patent applications, and other proprietary rights, that we own or control through licensing, are important to our business and competitive position. In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovations to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We seek to protect these, in part, through confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants, advisors and other parties. Our success will depend in part on our ability, and the ability of our licensor, to obtain, maintain (including making periodic filings and payments) and enforce our patents, including those patents and applications to which we have exclusive rights.
We own or have exclusively licensed seven issued United States patents and eight pending patent applications for the United States (including U.S. provisional applications). We also have 80 issued or allowed foreign patents and 46 pending foreign patent applications (including pending PCT Applications) intended to protect the intellectual property underlying our technology. In addition to the United States, we have patents issued or applications pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe (EPO), Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russian Federation, and Singapore. Our patent applications describe and claim certain features of our technologies, including our T cell activation and expansion platform, our cell therapy product candidates, and our drug candidates based on injectable artificial antigen presenting cells. We currently control issued patents in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe (through the European Patent Convention), Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, and Russian Federation, which relate to the technology for generating our cell therapy products (NEXI-001 and NEXI-002) from allogeneic or autologous T cells. Applications relating to our NEXI-001 and NEXI-002 programs remain pending in all jurisdictions for which we have filed patent applications, including more recent patent applications that relate in part to the NEXI-001 and NEXI-002 composition of matter. In addition, we control issued or allowed patents in the United States, Australia, Brazil, China, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Europe (through the European Patent Convention) that relate to our AIM INJ programs, including patents covering compositions of matter and methods of use. Applications relating to our AIM INJ programs remain pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Russian Federation, South Korea, Singapore, and United States. We have and will continue to actively protect our intellectual property, including filing patent applications for our innovations, prosecuting our pending patent applications, and maintaining and enforcing our issued patents. We currently have one pending PCT Application and one pending U.S. provisional application relating to both our cell therapy and AIM INJ technology. No assurances can be given that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or that the examination process will not require us to narrow our claims. In addition, issued patents may be circumvented by third parties, or found unenforceable or invalid if contested before a court or administrative agency. Thus, we may not be able to successfully enforce our patent rights against third parties. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop a similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us.
Each of our patents, if and when granted, will generally have a term of 20 years from its earliest, non-provisional filing date, subject to available extensions. Our patents and, if granted, patent applications have expiry dates ranging from 2034 to 2044.
For more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology and processes, please see the section of this filing on Form 10-K captioned “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Therapeutic products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and other governmental agency regulations in the United States and in foreign countries. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals or clearances, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, denial of export applications, governmental prohibitions on entering into supply contracts, and criminal prosecution. Failure to obtain regulatory approvals or the restriction, suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals or clearances, as well as any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In connection with therapeutic approval, we will have to comply with the many requirements associated with preclinical and clinical trials, the FDA application process, the terms of any pre-certification protocols and agreements, FDA manufacturing requirements for prototypes, and testing. Upon approval of a Biologics License Application, or BLA and similar approvals in other jurisdictions, there will be additional regulation relating to the packaging, distribution, marking, marketing and claims of our potential products. These later regulations are not only found in federal regulation but many states and, of course, foreign countries.
The U.S. FDA Process
The FDA regulates the clinical testing and design of therapeutics to ensure that medical products distributed in the United States are safe and effective for their intended uses. The application process for a new therapeutic is highly regulated.
As a biopharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation by relevant authorities. Our potential products will be regulated as biologics. With this classification, commercial production of our potential products will need to occur in registered and licensed facilities in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, established by the FDA for biologics. The FDA categorizes human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps, as either minimally manipulated or more than minimally manipulated, and has determined that more than minimally manipulated products require clinical trials to demonstrate product safety and efficacy and the submission of a BLA for marketing authorization.
Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local levels) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in a foreign country. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Product Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Services Act, or PHSA, and their respective implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The FDA has limited experience with 
commercial development of T cell therapies for cancer, including direct-injectable technologies such as AIM INJ. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practice, or GLP, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
•submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, compliance with the FDA’s current good tissue practice, or cGTP, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
•potential FDA audit of the trial and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
•review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; and
•FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
Preclinical studies
Before testing any biological product candidate, including our product candidates, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product candidate’s biological characteristics, chemistry, toxicity, stability and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
Human clinical trials in support of a BLA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to human research subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a clinical trial involving a biological product candidate at any time before or during the trial due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, the trial may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent form that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. In certain cases, clinical trials also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
Information about certain clinical trials, including details of the protocol and eventually study results, also must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on the ClinicalTrials.gov data registry. Information related to the investigational product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Failure to timely register a covered clinical trial or to submit trial results as provided for in the law can give rise to civil monetary penalties and also prevent the non-compliant party from receiving future grant funds from the federal government. The NIH’s Final Rule on ClinicalTrials.gov registration and reporting requirements became effective in 2017, and both NIH and FDA have recently begun enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase I. The product candidate is initially introduced into human subjects to test for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
•Phase II. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible safety risks (adverse effects), optimize dosing and preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases.
•Phase III. Clinical trials are undertaken in an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, and safety, often at geographically dispersed trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase IV clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events, or SAEs, occur. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the clinical protocol, GCP, or other IRB requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor known as the data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints.
During the development of a new drug or biological product, sponsors have the opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain points, including prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II, and before submission of a BLA. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 
II meeting to discuss their Phase II clinical results with the agency and to present their plans for the pivotal Phase III studies that they believe will support approval of the new drug or biological product.
Human immunotherapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of subjects the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of immunotherapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. A BLA in particular must contain sufficient evidence of the biological product candidate’s safety, purity, potency and efficacy for its proposed indication or indications. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, or PDUFA, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
According to the goals and policies for original BLAs agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. For all original BLAs, the ten and six-month time periods run from the filing date; for all other submissions, including resubmissions, efficacy supplements and other supplements, the FDA’s stated review time periods, ranging from two to ten month, run from the submission date. Despite these review goals, it is not uncommon for FDA review of a BLA to extend beyond the goal date.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date it is accepted for filing, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months from the date the application is accepted for filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making final decisions on approval. The FDA likely will re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the drug or biological product. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For cell- or tissue-based immunotherapy products, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the cGTP, to the extent applicable. The FDA’s cGTP regulations and guidance documents govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that cellular tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, cGTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration is required to submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase II meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase III or Phase II/III clinical trial. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from pre-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the PREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s).
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The CRL may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may choose to either resubmit the BLA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in response to an issued CRL in either two or six months depending on the type of information included. 
Even with the submission of this additional information, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
If a product receives regulatory approval from the FDA, the approval is limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the application. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval trials, including Phase IV clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development or review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include fast track designation, Breakthrough Therapy Designation and priority review designation and regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation.
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the BLA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA. In addition, fast track designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging from the clinical trial process.
In addition, with the enactment of FDASIA in 2012, Congress created a new regulatory program for product candidates designated by FDA as “breakthrough therapies” upon a request made by the IND sponsors. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs or biologics designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval of their respective marketing applications. The FDA must take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, such as holding timely meetings with and providing advice to the product sponsor, which are intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
Finally, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug or biologic that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines at the time that the marketing application is submitted, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months for an original BLA from the date of filing.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, congress created an accelerated approval pathway for regenerative medicine advanced therapies, or RMATs, which includes therapeutic tissue engineered products, human cell and tissue products, cell therapies and combination products using any such therapies. The program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative medicine therapies that are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.
A sponsor may request a RMAT designation from the FDA concurrently with or any time after the IND submission. The FDA has 60 calendar days to determine if the drug product meets the required criteria. Preliminary clinical evidence that the product has the potential to address a serious unmet need or condition is expected, is not required to indicate that the drug product may offer significant improvement over current therapies. The RMAT designation provides the same benefits of the fast track and breakthrough designation programs and programs may be eligible for priority review. Products with the RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval if pre-agreed criteria are met.
Accelerated Approval Pathway
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval from the FDA and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a drug or biologic when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures. Drugs and biologics granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval when the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate long-term clinical benefit of a drug.
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. For example, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large clinical trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase IV or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm the predicted clinical benefit of the product during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw approval of the drug. All promotional materials for product candidates being considered and approved under the accelerated approval program are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA 
or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use will be disclosed publicly by the FDA; the posting will also indicate whether the drug or biologic is no longer designated as an orphan drug. More than one product candidate may receive an orphan drug designation for the same indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to seven years of orphan product exclusivity. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a product containing the same active moiety for the same disease, except in very limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Thus, orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our potential products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA and we are not able to show the clinical superiority of our product candidate or if our product candidate’s indication is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product orphan indication. In addition, the FDA will not recognize orphan drug exclusivity if a sponsor fails to demonstrate upon approval that the product is clinically superior to a previously approved product containing the same active moiety for the same orphan condition, regardless of whether or not the previously approved product was designated an orphan drug or had orphan drug exclusivity. A product that has received orphan drug designation may not receive orphan exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received the designation. Orphan exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the same disease or condition, or the same product for a different disease or condition.
The period of orphan exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA and applies only to the disease or condition for which the product has been designated. In September 2021, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit held that, for the purpose of determining the scope of exclusivity, the term “same disease or condition” in the statute means the designated “rare disease or condition” and could not be interpreted by the Agency to mean the “indication or use.” Thus, the court concluded, orphan drug exclusivity applies to the entire designated disease or condition rather than the “indication or use.” It is unclear how this court decision will be implemented by the FDA.
Patent Term Restoration
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our biological products, some of our US patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension. These patent term extensions permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for any patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of a BLA, plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
Pediatric exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is a type of non-patent marketing exclusivity available in the United States and, if granted, it provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described studies.
Reference Product Exclusivity for Biological Products
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was enacted in the United States and included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA. The BPCIA amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in 
Europe. The FDA has also issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to reviewing and approving biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars.
A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Upon licensure by the FDA, an interchangeable biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product, although to date no such products have been approved for marketing in the United States.
The biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that the product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical studies to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency.
A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed. If pediatric studies are performed and accepted by the FDA as responsive to a Written Request, the 12-year exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months. In addition, the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a supplement for the reference product for a subsequent application filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the reference product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
The BPCIA is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any potential products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses (known as off-label use), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available medical products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem such uses to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, it is FDA’s position that manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or a supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS 
could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the quality and long-term stability of the product. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our product candidates must meet cGMP and cGTP requirements and satisfy the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities before any product is approved and our commercial products can be manufactured. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP and cGTP regulations. These third-party manufacturers must comply with cGMP and cGTP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP and cGTP. Manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics and HCT/Ps are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, cGTP, and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP and cGTP compliance, as applicable. Future inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our CMOs that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, the discovery of conditions that violate these rules, including failure to conform to cGMP or cGTP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, voluntary recall and regulatory sanctions as described below.
Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
Once an approval or clearance of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. Furthermore, the the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, including most biological products. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10-year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations within the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the 28-member European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. It is not yet clear how the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union will affect the approval of medicinal products in the UK. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
European Union drug development, review and approval
In the European Union, our product candidates also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. Similar to the United States, the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
The new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which became effective in January 2022, aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the CTA must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. Investigational medicinal products used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practices. Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAA, either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures.
ATMP review and approval in the EU
In the EU, medicinal products, including advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by regulatory authorities at both the EU and Member State levels. Regulated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007, ATMPs comprise gene therapy products, somatic cell therapy products and tissue engineered products. Gene therapy products deliver genes into the body that lead to a therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic effect. We anticipate that our NEXI-001 and NEXI-002 product candidates will be regulated as ATMPs in the EU.
To obtain regulatory approval of an ATMP under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, under the centralized procedure administered by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. The application used to submit a BLA in the United States is similar to the required application process in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, certain specific requirements set out in the ATMP Regulation, for example certain additional product characteristic information that must be included in the MAA. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid across all of the EU. As provided for in the ATMP Regulation, the scientific evaluation of MAAs for ATMPs is primarily performed by a specialized scientific committee called the Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT. The CAT prepares a draft opinion on the quality, safety and efficacy of the ATMP which is the subject of the MAA, which is sent for final approval to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. The CHMP recommendation is then sent to the European Commission, which adopts a decision binding in all EU Member States. The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA for an ATMP is 210 days from receipt of a valid MAA, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CAT and/or CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, which makes and issues the final decision to grant a marketing authorization within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the timeframe of 210 days for assessment will be reduced to 150 days (excluding clock stops), but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
Now that the United Kingdom (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Irish Protocol, centralized marketing authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations on January, 1 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the United Kingdom medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required.
Conditional approval
In specific circumstances, E.U. legislation (Article 14(7) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on Conditional Marketing Authorizations for Medicinal Products for Human Use) enables applicants to obtain a conditional marketing authorization prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products) if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) the product fulfills unmet medical needs and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization.
Pediatric studies
Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are set forth in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, which is referred to as the Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine in children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population.
Before a marketing authorization application can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP.
European Union regulatory exclusivity
In the EU, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
European Union orphan designation and exclusivity
The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union, are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The ten-year market exclusivity in the EU may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:
•the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
•the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
•the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
PRIME designation
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines (“PRIME”) scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation, where the marketing authorization application will be made through the centralized procedure. Eligible products must target conditions for which where is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the EU or, if there is, the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the CHMP or CAT are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of 
the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. Where, during the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.
Periods of authorization and renewals
A marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
Brexit and the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom
In June 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, in March 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The United Kingdom formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which EU pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the United Kingdom. This transition period ended on December 31, 2020. Since the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU Directives and Regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom as United Kingdom legislation now has the potential to diverge from EU legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom in the long-term. The MHRA, the United Kingdom medicines and medical devices regulator, has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow from January 1, 2021 now that the transition period is over, which will be updated as the United Kingdom’s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission issued a decision that the United Kingdom ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred under the GDPR from the European Union to the United Kingdom.
Rest of the world regulation
For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products approved by the FDA will depend in significant part on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement for the products. Third-party payors include government healthcare programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Further, there is no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement in the United States. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals.
Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
Furthermore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree.
Moreover, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Payment methodologies may also be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. There also has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. By way of example, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated, or the impact of the IRA on our business.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to currently available therapies (so-called health technology assessment, or HTA) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be priced significantly lower.
The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States and parallel distribution (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states) can further reduce prices. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
Other U.S. Health Care Laws and Regulations
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors expose us to broadly applicable healthcare regulation and enforcement by the U.S. federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our 
business, such as fraud and abuse, transparency and health information privacy rules and regulations. These laws include, without limitation:
•the federal anti-kickback statute, prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
•the federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and the civil monetary penalties law, which among other things prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters;
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, for covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates and covered subcontractors that provide services to, or on behalf of, the covered entity that involve individually identifiable health information;
•the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act require certain manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report, on an annual basis, to the Department of Health and Human Services, or DHS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will also be required to report information related to payments and other transfers of value provided in the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives;
•the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws and regulations pertaining to our financial relationships and interactions with foreign government officials, which prohibit U.S. companies and their employees, officers, and representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official (including, potentially, healthcare professionals in countries in which we operate or may sell our products), government staff member, political party, or political candidate to obtain or retain business or to otherwise seek favorable treatment; and
•analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving health care items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
In November 2020, the DHHS finalized significant changes to the regulations implementing the AKS, as well as the Physician Self-Referral Law (Stark Law) and the civil monetary penalty rules regarding beneficiary inducements, with the goal of offering the healthcare industry more flexibility and reducing the regulatory burden associated with those fraud and abuse laws, particularly with respect to value-based arrangements among industry participants.
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, or the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. In addition, state and local laws may require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Violations of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, may subject us to significant penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.
Health Care Reform in the United States and Potential Changes to Health Care Laws
The FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
As previously mentioned, a primary trend in the U.S. health care industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other health care funding. As previously mentioned, a primary trend in the U.S. health care industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other health care funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Act. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact health care laws and regulations or our business.
There has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical and biologic products. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other health care funding and applying new payment methodologies. In addition to the sweeping reforms contained in the ACA, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States that may affect health care expenditures. For example, the 2020 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-94) included a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act, or the CREATES Act. The CREATES Act aims to address the concern articulated by both the FDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the distribution of their products, including by invoking the existence of a REMS program for certain products, to deny generic product developers access to samples of brand products. Because generic product developers need samples to conduct certain comparative testing required by the FDA, some have attributed the inability to timely obtain samples as a cause of delay in the entry of generic products. To remedy this concern, the CREATES Act establishes a private cause of action that permits a generic product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples on “commercially reasonable, market-based terms.” Whether and how generic product developments will use this new pathway, as 
well as the likely outcome of any legal challenges to provisions of the CREATES Act, remain highly uncertain and its potential effects on our future commercial products are unknown.
The Biden Administration, which assumed control of the Executive Branch on January 20, 2021, has indicated that lowering prescription drug prices is a priority. For example, in July 2021, President Biden issued a sweeping executive order on promoting competition in the American economy that includes several mandates pertaining to the pharmaceutical and health care insurance industries. Among other things, the executive order directs the FDA to work towards implementing a system for importing drugs from Canada (following on a Trump administration notice-and-comment rulemaking on Canadian drug importation that was finalized in October 2020). The Biden order also called on HHS to release a comprehensive plan to combat high prescription drug prices, and it includes several directives regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s oversight of potentially anticompetitive practices within the pharmaceutical industry. The drug pricing plan released by HHS in September 2021 in response to the executive order makes clear that the Biden Administration supports aggressive action to address rising drug prices, including allowing HHS to negotiate the cost of Medicare Part B and D drugs, but such significant changes will require either new legislation to be passed by Congress or time-consuming administrative actions.
We expect that federal, state and local governments in the United States will continue to consider legislation directed at lowering the total cost of health care. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the states’ ability to regulate pharmaceutical benefit managers, or PBMs, and other members of the health care and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that may lead to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize any product that is ultimately approved, if approved. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
