ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 Ennis, Inc. (formerly Ennis Business Forms, Inc.) (collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “Registrant,” “Ennis,” or “we,” “us,” or “our”) was organized under the laws of Texas in 1909. We and our subsidiaries print and manufacture a broad line of business forms and other business products.  We distribute business products and forms throughout the United States primarily through independent dealers.  This distributor channel encompasses independent print distributors, commercial printers, direct mail, fulfillment companies, payroll and accounts payable software companies, and advertising agencies, among others.  We also sell products to many of our competitors to satisfy their customers’ needs.
 On July 31, 2018, we issued an aggregate of 829,126 shares of our common stock, par value $2.50 per share (the “Shares”), to the former stockholders of Wright Business Forms, Inc., d/b/a Wright Business Graphics (“Wright” or “WBG”), as partial consideration for the acquisition by us of all of the outstanding equity interests of WBG by way of a merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours with and into WBG pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 16, 2018 (the “Merger Agreement”).  The Shares issued to the former stockholders of WBG represent aggregate consideration under the Merger Agreement equal to approximately $16.2 million.  An additional $19.7 million was paid in cash to the stockholders of Wright, subject to a final working capital adjustment, and $2.6 million was paid to pay-off outstanding debt.  The sale of the Shares was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act of 1993, as amended, and Regulation D promulgated thereunder.  The goodwill recognized as a part of the merger is not deductible for tax purposes.  Wright is a printing company headquartered in Portland, Oregon with additional locations in Washington and California.  The business produces forms, pressure seal, packaging, direct mail, checks, statement processing and commercial printing and sells mainly through distributors and resellers. Wright, which generated approximately $58.0 million in sales for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, continues to operate under its brand names.
 On April 30, 2018, we acquired the assets of Allen-Bailey Tag & Label (“ABTL”), a tag and label operation located in New York for $4.7 million in cash plus the assumption of trade payables, subject to a working capital adjustment.  In addition, contingent consideration of up to $500,000 is payable to the sellers if certain sales levels are maintained over the next three years.  On July 7, 2017, we acquired the assets of a separate tag operation located in Ohio for $1.4 million in cash plus the assumption of certain accrued liabilities.  Management considers both of these acquisitions immaterial.
 On January 27, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Independent Printing Company, Inc. and its related entities (collectively “Independent”) for $17.7 million in cash consideration, in a stock purchase transaction.  Independent’s main facility located in DePere, Wisconsin. The business produces presentation folders, checks, wide format and commercial print. Independent operates under its brand name and generated approximately $37.0 million in sales during the 2016 calendar year.  Independent sells mainly through distributors and resellers. We now have four folder facilities located in Michigan, Kansas, California and Wisconsin, as well as wide format capabilities in Colorado and Wisconsin.
 Business Overview
 Our management believes we are the largest provider of business forms, pressure-seal forms, labels, tags, envelopes, and presentation folders to independent distributors in the United States.
 We are in the business of manufacturing, designing and selling business forms and other printed business products primarily to distributors located in the United States. We operate 60 manufacturing plants throughout the United States in 21 strategically located states as one reportable segment. Approximately 95% of the business products we manufacture are custom and semi-custom products, constructed in a wide variety of sizes, colors, number of parts and quantities on an individual job basis, depending upon the customers’ specifications.

The products we sell include snap sets, continuous forms, laser cut sheets, tags, labels, envelopes, integrated products, jumbo rolls and pressure sensitive products in short, medium and long runs under the following labels: Ennis®, Royal Business Forms®, Block Graphics®, Specialized Printed Forms®, 360º Custom LabelsSM, ColorWorx®, Enfusion®, Uncompromised Check Solutions®, VersaSeal®, Ad ConceptsSM, FormSource LimitedSM, Star Award Ribbon Company®, Witt Printing®, B&D Litho®, Genforms®, PrintGraphics®, Calibrated Forms®, PrintXcel®, Printegra®, Falcon Business FormsSM, Forms ManufacturersSM, Mutual GraphicsSM, TRI-C Business FormsSM, Major Business SystemsSM, Independent PrintingSM, Hoosier Data Forms®, Hayes Graphics®, Wright Business GraphicsSM and Wright 360SM.  We also sell the Adams McClure® brand (which provides Point of Purchase advertising for large franchise and fast food chains as well as kitting and fulfillment); the Admore®, Folder Express® and Independent Folders® brands (which provide presentation folders and document folders); Ennis Tag & LabelSM (which provides custom printed, high performance labels and custom and stock tags); Allen-Bailey Tag & LabelSM, Atlas Tag & Label®, Kay Toledo Tag® and Special Service Partners® (SSP) (which provides custom and stock tags and labels); Trade Envelopes®, Block Graphics®, Wisco® and National Imprint Corporation® (which provide custom and imprinted envelopes) and Northstar® and General Financial Supply® (which provide financial and security documents).
 We sell predominantly through private printers and independent distributors, as well as to many of our competitors. Northstar Computer Forms, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, also sells direct to a small number of customers, generally large banking organizations (where a distributor is not acceptable or available to the end-user).  Adams McClure, LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary, also sells direct to a small number of customers, where sales are generally through advertising agencies.
 The printing industry generally sells its products either predominantly to end users, a market dominated by a few large manufacturers, such as R.R. Donnelley and Sons, Staples, Inc., Standard Register Co. (a subsidiary of Taylor Corporation), and Cenveo, Inc., or, like the Company, through a variety of independent distributors and distributor groups. While it is not possible, because of the lack of adequate public statistical information, to determine the Company’s share of the total business products market, management believes the Company is the largest producer of business forms, pressure-seal forms, labels, tags, envelopes, and presentation folders in the United States distributing primarily through independent dealers. 
 There are a number of competitors that operate in this segment, ranging in size from single employee-owned operations to multi-plant organizations. We believe our strategic locations and buying power permit us to compete on a favorable basis within the distributor market on competitive factors, such as service, quality, and price.
 Distribution of business forms and other business products throughout the United States is primarily done through independent dealers, including business forms distributors, resellers, direct mail, commercial printers, payroll and accounts payable software companies, and advertising agencies.
 Raw materials principally consist of a wide variety of weights, widths, colors, sizes, and qualities of paper for business products purchased primarily from one major supplier at favorable prices based on the volume of business.
 Business products usage in the printing industry is generally not seasonal. General economic conditions and contraction of the traditional business forms industry are the predominant factors in quarterly volume fluctuations.
 Patents, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
 Outside of the patent for our VersaSeal® product, we do not have any significant patents, licenses, franchises, or concessions.

 Customers
 No single customer accounts for as much as five percent of our consolidated net sales or accounts receivable.
 Backlog
 At February 28, 2019, our backlog of orders was approximately $22.5 million, as compared to approximately $17.4 million at February 28, 2018.
 Research and Development
 While we seek new products to sell through our distribution channel, there have been no material amounts spent on research and development in fiscal years 2019, 2018 or 2017.
Environment
 We are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, wastewater discharges, air emissions and solid waste disposal. Our manufacturing processes do not emit substantial foreign substances into the environment. We do not believe that our compliance with federal, state, or local statutes or regulations relating to the protection of the environment has any material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position. There can be no assurance, however, that future changes in federal, state, or local regulations, interpretations of existing regulations or the discovery of currently unknown problems or conditions will not require substantial additional expenditures. Similarly, the extent of our liability, if any, for past failures to comply with laws, regulations, and permits applicable to our operations cannot be determined.
Employees
 At February 28, 2019, we had 2,470 employees.  252 employees are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements, which are subject to periodic negotiations.  We believe we have a good working relationship with all of the unions that represent our employees.
