Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Fortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress” or the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to acquiring, developing and commercializing pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and product candidates, which we do at the Fortress level, at our majority-owned and majority-controlled subsidiaries and joint ventures, and at entities we founded and in which we maintain significant minority ownership positions. Fortress has a talented and experienced business development team, comprising scientists, doctors and finance professionals, who identify and evaluate promising products and product candidates for potential acquisition by new or existing partner companies. We have executed such arrangements in collaboration with some of the world’s foremost universities, research institutes and pharmaceutical companies, including City of Hope National Medical Center, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and University College London.
 
Following the exclusive license or other acquisition of the intellectual property underpinning a product or product candidate, Fortress leverages its business, scientific, regulatory, legal and finance expertise to help our partners achieve their goals. Our partner companies then assess a broad range of strategic arrangements to accelerate and provide additional funding to support research and development, including joint ventures, partnerships, out-licensings, and public and private financings.
 
Our business approach is designed for maximum flexibility, allowing us to pursue a broad array of new biopharmaceutical technologies with clinical and commercial potential. It enables us to move quickly to take advantage of time-sensitive opportunities when necessary and provides us with a range of options from which to select what we deem the most advantageous corporate or financial structure for each drug candidate. We seek to acquire, develop and commercialize drugs, drug candidates, technologies and operating subsidiaries with high growth potential, both at the Fortress level and via our partner companies. We believe that focusing on the identification, acquisition and early-stage development of product candidates while benefitting from our partners’ development and commercialization expertise will reduce our internal expenses and allow us to have a larger number of product candidates progress to later stages of drug development.
 
As of the end of 2018, several of our partner companies possess licenses to product candidate intellectual property, including Aevitas Therapeutics, Inc. (“Aevitas”), Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. (“Avenue”), Caelum Biosciences, Inc. (“Caelum”), Cellvation, Inc. (“Cellvation”), Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (“Checkpoint”), Cyprium Therapeutics, Inc. (“Cyprium”), Helocyte, Inc. (“Helocyte”), Journey Medical Corporation (“Journey” or “JMC”), Mustang Bio, Inc. (“Mustang”), and Tamid Bio, Inc. (“Tamid”). 
 
As used throughout this filing, the words “we”, “us” and “our” may refer to Fortress individually or together with our affiliates and partners, as dictated by context.
Product Candidates and Other Intellectual Property

Triderm™: Triderm™ is topical corticosteroid cream indicated for the he relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. Triderm™ is sold under a co-promote agreement with Crown Labs.
 
MB-107 (XSCID)
 
Our partner company Mustang also collaborates with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (“St. Jude”) in the development of a first-in-class ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy for the treatment of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (“XSCID”). On August 2, 2018, Mustang entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with St. Jude for the development of a first-in-class ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy for the treatment of XSCID. Mustang paid an upfront fee of $1.0 million, in August 2018 in consideration for the exclusive license. Additional payments are due to St. Jude upon the achievement of five development and commercialization milestones. XSCID is the most common form of severe immune deficiency. The acquisition of this license expands our pipeline into gene-therapy, allowing us to leverage existing synergies for Mustang’s Worcester, Massachusetts cell-processing facility.
 
CAEL-101 (AL Amyloidosis)
 
Our partner company Caelum, in collaboration with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is working to develop a novel antibody (“mAb 11-1F4”), CAEL-101, for the treatment of amyloid light chain (“AL”) amyloidosis. CAEL-101 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody (“mAb”) designed to improve organ function by reducing or eliminating amyloid deposits in the tissues and organs of patients with AL amyloidosis. The antibody is designed to bind to insoluble light chain amyloid protein, including both kappa and lambda subtypes. In a Phase 1a/1b study, CAEL-101 demonstrated improved organ function, including cardiac and renal function, in 27 patients with relapsed and refractory AL amyloidosis who had previously not had an organ response to standard of care therapy. This data supports CAEL-101’s potential to be a well-tolerated therapy that promotes amyloid resolution. CAEL-101 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a therapy for patients with AL amyloidosis, and as a radio-imaging agent in AL amyloidosis.
 
Hematologic Malignancies
 
Our partner company Mustang collaborates with the City of Hope National Medical Center (“COH”) and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (“Fred Hutch”) in the development of proprietary chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) engineered T-cell (“CAR T”) therapies. CAR T uses the patient’s own T-cells to engage and destroy specific tumors. The process involves selecting specific T-cell subtypes, genetically engineering them to express chimeric antigen T-cell receptors and placing them back in the patient where they recognize and destroy cancer cells. We believe that harnessing the body’s own immune system to treat cancer is the next generation of cancer care that may prove curative across tumor types that have proved resistant to standard pharmacological and biological treatments.

MB-102 (CD123 CAR T Program for AML)
 
CD123 is a subunit of the heterodimeric interleukin-3-receptor (“IL-3R”) which is widely expressed on human hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”). In addition, CD123 can be found on the surface of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“B-ALL”), hairy cell leukemia, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (“BPDCN”), chronic myeloid leukemia (“CML”) and Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
 
Our partner Mustang is currently investigating CD123 as a target for adoptive cellular immunotherapy in AML and BPDCN since high CD123 expression is associated with enhanced AML blast proliferation, increased resistance of blasts to apoptosis, and poor clinical prognosis. CD123 is overexpressed in the vast majority of cases of AML and in essentially all cases of BPDCN. MB-102 is currently in development at our partner company Mustang.
 
MB-106 (CD20 CAR T Program for B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma)
 
CD20 is a B-cell lineage-specific phosphoprotein that is expressed in high, homogeneous density on the surface of more than 95% of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”). CD20 is stable on the cell surface with minimal shedding or internalization upon binding antibody and is present at only nanomolar levels as soluble antigen. It is well established as an effective immunotherapy target, with extensive studies demonstrating improved tumor responses and survival of B-NHL patients treated with rituximab and other anti-CD20 antibodies.
 
More than 70,000 new cases of NHL are diagnosed each year in the United States, and more than 19,000 patients die of this group of diseases annually. Most forms of NHL including follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma, which account collectively for ~45% of all cases of NHL are incurable with available therapies, except for allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (“allo-SCT”). However, many NHL patients are not suitable candidates for allo-SCT, and this treatment is also limited by significant rates of morbidity and mortality due to graft versus host disease. Innovative new treatments are therefore urgently needed.
 
Fred Hutch has an open IND for a Phase 1 clinical study to assess the anti-tumor activity and safety of administering CAR T cells; as of December 31, 2018, five patients have been treated. This IND was submitted on February 24, 2017, with Fred Hutch as the sponsor. The trial will also assess the T cell persistence and determine the potential immunogenicity of the cells, and Mustang together with Fred Hutch will determine a recommended Phase 2 dose. MB-106 is currently in development at our partner company Mustang.
 
MB-104 (CS1 CAR T for Multiple Myeloma and Light Chain Amyloidosis)
 
CS1 (also known as CD319, CRACC and SLAMF7) was identified as an NK cell receptor regulating immune functions. It is also expressed on B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, NK-T cells, and monocytes. CS1 is overexpressed in multiple myeloma (“MM”) and light chain amyloidosis (“AL”), which makes it a good target for immunotherapy. A humanized anti-CS1 antibody, elotuzumab (EmplicitiÔ), has shown promising results in clinical studies. Despite great advances in treatment, MM remains an incurable malignancy of plasma cells. AL is a protein deposition disorder that is a result of a plasma cell dysplasia, similar to MM. Immunotherapy is an attractive approach for AL because of the low burden of disease. Our academic partners at COH have developed a novel second generation CS1-specific CAR T cell therapy. In pre-clinical studies, they have demonstrated efficacy of these CAR T cells, both in vitro and in vivo, within the context of clinically relevant models of MM and AL. COH will be evaluating the safety of this CS1-specific CAR T cell therapy in a Phase 1/2 trial that is scheduled to commence in the first half of 2019.

Solid Tumors
 
MB-101 (IL13Ra2 CAR T Cell Program for Glioblastoma)
 
Glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM”) is the most common brain and central nervous system (“CNS”) cancer, accounting for for 45.2% of malignant primary brain and CNS tumors, 54% of all gliomas, and 16% of all primary brain and CNS tumors. There are an estimated 12,390 new glioblastoma cases predicted in 2017 in the US. Malignant brain tumors are the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in adolescents and young adults aged 15-39 and the most common cancer occurring among 15-19 year-olds in the US. While GBM is a rare disease (2-3 cases per 100,000 persons per year in the US and EU), it is quite lethal, with five-year survival rates historically under 10%. Standard of care therapy consists of maximal surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy with temozolomide, which, while rarely curative, is shown to extend median overall survival from 4.5 to 15 months. GBM remains difficult to treat due to the inherent resistance of the tumor to conventional therapies.
 
Immunotherapy approaches targeting brain tumors offer promise over conventional treatments. IL13Ra2 is an attractive target for CAR T therapy, as it has limited expression in normal tissue but is over-expressed on the surface of greater than 50% of GBMs. CAR T cells are designed to express membrane-tethered IL-13 receptor ligand mutated at a single site (glutamic acid at position 13 to a tyrosine; E13Y) with high affinity for IL13Rα2 and reduced binding to IL13Ra1 in order to reduce healthy tissue targeting (Kahlon KS et al. Cancer Research. 2004;64:9160-9166).
 
Our partner Mustang is currently developing an optimized CAR T product incorporating enhancements in CAR T design and T cell engineering to improve antitumor potency and T cell persistence. The next step is to continue to enroll patients in this Phase 1 study to determine the maximum tolerated dose and a recommended Phase 2 dose. Additionally, in this Phase 1 study, Mustang is exploring optimal modes of delivery for CAR T cells for the treatment of GBM and optimal T cell selection. MB-101 is currently in development at our partner company Mustang.
 
MB-103 (HER2 CAR T for GBM & Metastatic Breast Cancer to Brain)
 
HER2/neu (often shortened to “HER2”) is a growth-promoting protein on the outside of all breast cells. Breast cancer cells with higher than normal levels of HER2 are called HER2-positive (“HER2+”). These cancers tend to grow and spread faster than other breast cancers. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, with over 40,000 women in the United States expected to die from advanced metastatic disease in 2018. Approximately 20% to 25% of breast cancers overexpress HER2, which is an established therapeutic target of both monoclonal antibodies (“mAbs”) and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. With the advent of effective mAbs directed against HER2, the median overall survival of patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer has improved. However, management of metastatic disease in the brain and/or CNS observed in up to 50% of HER2+ breast cancer patients, continues to be a clinical challenge in large part due to the inability of mAbs to sufficiently cross the blood-brain barrier. Although small-molecule inhibitors of HER2 exist and have been clinically approved, their single-agent efficacy in the context of metastatic disease to the brain has been limited. While HER2-targeted therapy in combination with conventional agents has shown some promise for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer, control of brain metastases remains a significant unmet clinical need, as most patients survive less than two years following CNS involvement.
 
CAR-based T-cell immunotherapy is being actively investigated for the treatment of solid tumors, including HER2+ cancers. Mustang’s academic partners at COH have developed a second-generation HER2-specific CAR T-cell for the treatment of breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain. COH’s preclinical data demonstrate effective targeting of breast cancer brain metastases with intraventricular delivery of HER2-BB CAR T cells. COH will be evaluating the safety of this HER2-specific CAR T cell therapy in two phase 1/2 Trials that commenced in Q4 2018. MB-103 is currently in development at our partner company Mustang.
 
MB-105 (PSCA CAR T for Prostate & Pancreatic Cancers)
 
PSCA is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell membrane glycoprotein. In addition to being highly expressed in the prostate it is also expressed in the bladder, placenta, colon, kidney, and stomach. Prostate cancer may be amenable to T cell-based immunotherapy since several tumor antigens, including prostate stem-cell antigen (PSCA), are widely over-expressed in metastatic disease. Mustang’s academic partners at COH have developed a second-generation PSCA specific CAR T cell therapy that has demonstrated robust in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity in patient-derived, clinically relevant, bone-metastatic prostate cancer xenograft models. COH will be evaluating safety of this PSCA-specific CAR T cell therapy in a Phase 1/2 Trial that is scheduled to commence in the second half of 2019. MB-105 is currently in development at our partner company Mustang.

Intravenous (IV) Tramadol
 
Our partner company Avenue, in collaboration with InvaGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is developing intravenous (IV) Tramadol, for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe post-operative pain. IV Tramadol may fill a gap in the acute pain market between IV acetaminophen/NSAIDs and IV conventional narcotics. Avenue is currently evaluating IV Tramadol in a pivotal Phase 3 program for the management of postoperative pain with positive data from its first pivotal Phase 3 study announced in May 2018. The second pivotal Phase 3 trial was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018, and Avenue expects to announce topline data in mid-2019.
CK-101 (EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC)
 
Our partner company Checkpoint is currently evaluating a lead small-molecule, targeted anti-cancer agent, CK-101, in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In September 2018, Checkpoint announced preliminary interim safety and efficacy data from its ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of CK-101. The data were presented in an oral presentation at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer in Toronto. Enrollment in the trial is ongoing to identify the optimal dose with a new softgel capsule formulation to maximize therapeutic effect, following which a Phase 3 trial is planned to initiate in 2019 in treatment-naïve EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC patients.
 
CK-301
 
Checkpoint is also currently evaluating its lead antibody product candidate, CK-301, an anti-PD-L1 antibody licensed from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in checkpoint therapy-naïve patients with selected recurrent or metastatic cancers, including ongoing cohorts intended to support one or more Biologies License Application (“BLA”) submissions.
 
CUTX-101
 
Our partner company Cyprium is currently developing CUTX-101, a copper histidinate injection for the treatment of Menkes disease. Menkes disease is a rare X-linked pediatric disease caused by gene mutations of copper transporter ATP7A, which affects approximately one in 100,000 newborns per year. Biochemically, Menkes patients may have low levels of copper in their blood and brains, as well as abnormal levels of catecholamine, but definitive diagnosis is typically made by sequencing of the ATP7A gene. There is no current FDA-approved treatment for Menkes disease and its variants. CUTX-101, along with an AAV-ATP7A gene therapy that is also being developed by Cyprium, was granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). CUTX-101 was also granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA for classic Menkes disease in patients who have not demonstrated significant clinical progression.
 
In January 2019, Cyprium received notification from the U.S. FDA that the sponsorship of the Investigational New Drug (“IND”) Application for CUTX-101 was transferred to Cyprium.
 
Triplex
 
Through our partner company Helocyte we are developing Triplex, a first-in-class and potentially best-in-class universal recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara viral vector vaccine engineered to induce a robust and durable virus-specific T cell response to three immuno-dominant proteins [UL83 (pp65), UL123 (IE1), UL122 (IE2)] linked to cytomegalovirus (CMV) complications in the transplant setting. In a Phase 1 study, Triplex was found to be safe, well-tolerated and highly immunogenic when administered to healthy volunteers at multiple dose levels (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01941056). In a recently-completed Phase 2 trial, Triplex was observed to be safe, well-tolerated, highly immunogenic and efficacious in reducing CMV events in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02506933). Triplex is currently the subject of multiple other ongoing and planned studies, one involving vaccination of the stem cell transplant donor (followed by vaccination of the recipient) in higher risk patients - potentially introducing CMV immunity sooner and positioning Triplex ahead of prophylactic antivirals in the standard of care. Helocyte secured an exclusive, worldwide license to Triplex from City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California in April of 2015.
Other Product Candidates
 
ConVax
 
We and our partner Helocyte are also developing ConVax, a universal recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara viral vector vaccine designed to induce robust and durable humoral and cellular immune responses to cytomegalovirus (CMV).

CEVA-101
 
Through our partner company Cellvation we are working to develop CEVA-101, a cellular product comprised of autologous Bone Marrow-derived Mononuclear Cells (“BMMNCs”) currently being developed for the treatment of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in adults and children.
 
CEVA-D and CEVA-102
 
Also in partnership with Cellvation, we are developing CEVA-D, a novel bioreactor device that enhances the anti-inflammatory potency of bone marrow-derived cells without genetic manipulation, using wall shear stress (WSS) to suppress tumor necrosis factor-a (“TNF-a”) production by activated immune cells. CEVA-102 is the first cell product produced by CEVA-D, which we plan to develop for the treatment of severe traumatic brain injury (“TBI”) in adults and children.
 
TAMID-001
 
Through our majority-owned partner Tamid we are developing Tamid-001, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy that targets the ocular manifestations of Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), a rare and progressively debilitating disorder which is caused by the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in multiple organs.
 
AVTS-001
 
Through our majority-owned partner Aevitas we are developing AVTS-001, an AAV gene therapy that restores lasting production of regulatory proteins, potentially providing a curative treatment for diseases with high unmet need.
 
CNDO-109
 
We continue to develop CNDO-109, a lysate that activates donor Natural Killer (NK) cells. We are also working with our partner company Mustang to genetically engineer CNDO-109-activated NK cells to express a CD123 chimeric antigen receptor construct as a potential combination therapy to treat AML.
 
Methazalomide
 
We are developing, in collaboration with Effcon Laboratories, Inc., an extended release formulation of methazalomide. Effcon leads the development efforts in connection therewith under our supervision and direction. We expect to initiate a pivotal and food effects study in 2019.
Intellectual Property Generally
 
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our and, in some cases, our partner companies’ product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our and, in some cases, our partner companies’ product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, patent protection may not afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents.
 
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our and our partners’ management and research and development personnel, as well as that of our advisers, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we and our partners currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we and our partners require all of our employees, consultants, advisers and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.

Competition
 
We and our partners operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Many of our and our partners’ competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research, some in direct competition with us and our partners. We and our partners also may compete with these organizations to recruit scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 
The only pharmaceutical area in which we sell marketed products is dermatology, and the dermatological product competitive landscape is highly fragmented, with a large number of mid-size and smaller companies competing in both the prescription sector and the OTC and cosmeceutical sectors. The market for our dermatological products is very competitive, both across product categories and geographies. In addition to larger diversified pharmaceutical and medical device companies, we face competition from mid-size and smaller, regional and entrepreneurial companies with fewer products in niche areas or regions. The oral acne antibiotic market, in which Targadox competes, is divided into two categories: minocycline and doxycycline. Targadox competes in the doxycycline category, primarily against Mayne Pharma’s Doryx® brand. Also, Almirall recently introduced SEYSARA™, a tetracycline-class drug indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 9 years of age and older. Exelderm®, a broad spectrum anti-fungal with two formulations, competes against Sebela Pharma’s Naftin® and Ortho Dermatologics Luzu®.
 
Our competitors are pursuing the development and/or acquisition of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and OTC products that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting in biotechnology, biopharmaceutical, dermatological and other therapeutic areas. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. The principal methods of competition for our products include quality, efficacy, market acceptance, price, and marketing and promotional efforts, patient access programs and product insurance coverage reimbursement.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we and our partners are developing.
United States Pharmaceutical Product Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical (drug and biologic) products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product-development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:

7
-


· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices (“GLPs”) or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Product Drug Application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s current good clinical practices (“GCPs”), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologic License Application (“BLA”) for a new pharmaceutical product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA/ BLA; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA/BLA.
--+----------------------------------------

 
The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain.
 
Products for somatic cell therapy are derived from a variety of biologic sources, including directly harvested autologous, allogeneic, or cultured cell lines. Product safety requires that these sources be well characterized, uniform, and not contaminated with hazardous adventitious agents. Also, cells directly from humans pose additional product safety issues. Because of the complex nature of these products, a controlled, reproducible manufacturing process and facility are required and relied on to produce a uniform product. The degree of reliance on a controlled process varies depending on the nature of the product. Because complete chemical characterization of a biologic product is not feasible for quality control, the testing of the biologic potency receives particular attention and is costly.
 
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the pharmaceutical product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA places the IND on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such clinical trial.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by the sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA if conducted under a U.S. IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB or ethics committee if conducted outside of the United States, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB or ethics committee is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB or ethics committee also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. We intend to use third-party clinical research organizations (“CROs”) to administer and conduct our planned clinical trials and will rely upon such CROs, as well as medical institutions, clinical investigators and consultants, to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and to play a significant role in the subsequent collection and analysis of data from these trials. The failure by any of such third parties to meet expected timelines, adhere to our protocols or meet regulatory standards could adversely impact the subject product development program. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

8
-


· | Phase 1. The pharmaceutical product is usually introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer treatments, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA/BLA or foreign authorities for approval of marketing applications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be requested by the FDA as a condition of approval.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or, if used, its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s or ethics committee’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected, tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
United States Review and Approval Processes
 
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA/BLA requesting approval to market the product.
 
The NDA/BLA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA/BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA/BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we, our partners or our or their suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements.

Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any pharmaceutical products for which we or our partners receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties.
 
The FDA also may require Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
 
Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, special incentives exist for sponsors to develop products for rare diseases or conditions, which are defined to include those diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Requests for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the submission of an NDA or BLA. In June 2012, we were notified by the FDA that CNDO-109 was granted orphan drug designation and in September 2012, the USPTO issued the first U.S. patent covering CNDO-109. If CNDO-109 is commercialized, we will be obligated to pay UCLB annual royalties based upon the net sales of product or if we sublicense CNDO-109, a portion of sub-licensing revenue we receive, if any.
 
If a product that has an orphan drug designation is the first such product to receive FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity for that use. This means that, subsequent to approval, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, for seven years. The FDA may approve a subsequent application from another person if the FDA determines that the application is for a different drug or different use, or if the FDA determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior, or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public’s need. If the FDA approves someone else’s application for the same drug that has orphan exclusivity, but for a different use, the competing drug could be prescribed by physicians outside its FDA approval for the orphan use, notwithstanding the existence of orphan exclusivity. A grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved. If a sponsor receives orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, there can be no assurance that the exclusivity will prevent another person from receiving approval for the same or a similar drug for the same or other uses.
 
Pediatric Information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs and BLAs or supplements to NDAs and BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the treatment for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the treatment is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides BLA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity-patent or non-patent-for a product if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within a specific time frame.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we and our partners receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation and regulations, including the Affordable Care Act.
International Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of any product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.

Item 1. | Legal Proceedings
--------+------------------

Fortress Biotech, Inc.
 
Dr. Falk Pharma, GmbH v. Fortress Biotech, Inc. (Frankfurt am Main Regional Court, Ref. No. 3-06 0 28/16). Dr. Falk Pharma, GmbH (“Dr. Falk Pharma”) and Fortress were among the parties to that certain Collaboration Agreement dated March 20, 2012, whereby they agreed to collaborate to develop a product for treatment of Crohn’s disease. A dispute arose between Dr. Falk Pharma and Fortress with respect to their relative rights and obligations under the Collaboration Agreement; specifically, Dr. Falk Pharma contended that it had fulfilled its contractual obligations to Fortress and is entitled to the final milestone payment due under the Collaboration Agreement - EUR 2.5 million. Fortress contended that no such payment is due because a condition of the EUR 2.5 million payment was the delivery of a Clinical Study Report that addressed the primary and secondary objectives of a Phase II trial, and Fortress contended that Dr. Falk Pharma failed to deliver such a Clinical Study Report. Dr. Falk Pharma filed a lawsuit against Fortress in the above-referenced Court in Frankfurt, Germany to recover the EUR 2.5 million plus interest and attorneys’ fees, and Fortress filed an answer to the complaint, denying that it had any liability to Dr. Falk Pharma. On July 27, 2017, Fortress received a judgment from the court in Frankfurt awarding the full amount (EUR 2.5 million) plus interest to Dr. Falk Pharma. Fortress appealed the decision to the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt on August 28, 2017, and the initial response of Dr. Falk Pharma to the appeal was filed on February 16, 2018. At an appellate hearing in the Higher Regional Court on June 12, 2018, the court issued an oral ruling upholding the lower court’s judgment and indicating that an impending written, enforceable judgment would do the same. On July 12, 2018, the Higher Regional Court approved and recorded terms of settlement between Fortress and Dr. Falk Pharma pursuant to which Fortress paid $3.3 million to Dr. Falk Pharma during the calendar year of 2018, and approximately $39,500 to the court in mandated administrative fees. An additional $300,000 is due during calendar year 2019.
