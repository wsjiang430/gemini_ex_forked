Repurchase of the Preferred Stock from Wipro, LLC
 
On December 2, 2022, we repurchased all 9,926 of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”) from Wipro, LLC (“Wipro”), the sole holder of the Preferred Stock pursuant to an agreement we entered into with Wipro in June 2022 (the “Repurchase Agreement”).
 
The Preferred Stock was repurchased in exchange for (i) a cash payment equal to its liquidation value, or a total cash payment of $9,926,000 and (ii) the issuance to Wipro, LLC of 100,000 shares of Harte Hanks common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the “Common Stock”).

On December 1, 2022, we repurchased all of the assets (the “Transaction”) of Inside Out Solutions, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“InsideOut”), for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $7.5 million (the “Purchase Price”) pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, dated as of December 1, 2022 by and between Harte Hanks and InsideOut (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”).

In addition, the owner and CEO of InsideOut entered into a two-year consulting agreement with us, which will ensure consistency in our delivery of these sales enablement offerings, post-closing.
 
Restructuring Activities
 
Our management team continuously reviews and adjusts our cost structure and operating footprint to optimize our operations, and invest in improved technology.  During 2020, in an effort to right-size our operating footprint, we terminated leases in Wilkes Barre (PA) and Grand Prairie (TX) and exited our last direct mail facility in Jacksonville (FL). We completed the migration of our fulfillment business from the Grand Prairie (TX) operations into a new 400,000 square foot facility in Kansas City (KS) in December 2020.  In the first quarter of 2021, we completed the migration of our Shawnee (KS) operations to Kansas City (KS).  The new Kansas City (KS) location is now our primary facility in the Midwest.  In 2020, we also reduced the footprint of our Customer Care business by reducing our Austin (TX) office location by approximately 50,000 square feet in addition to exiting one of our two Manila offices as the business was operating effectively in a work-from-home environment.  Finally, in 2021 we exited our remaining Customer Care office leases in Texarkana (TX) and Austin (TX) upon expiration of the lease term. 
 
In connection with our cost-saving and restructuring initiatives, we incurred total restructuring charges of $27.6 million through the end of 2021.  We completed our restructuring in 2021 and did not incur any additional restructuring expenses in 2022.
 
Customers
 
Our services are marketed to specific industries or markets. We tailor our services and software products depending on the industry or market we are targeting. We believe that we are generally able to provide services to new industries and markets by modifying our existing services and applications. We currently provide services primarily to the B2B, consumer brand, financial services, retail, and healthcare vertical markets, in addition to a range of other select markets. Our clients include large multinational enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses and government organizations.  Our largest client (measured in revenue) generated 12.2% of total revenues in 2022. Our largest 25 clients in terms of revenue generated 72.5% of total revenue in 2022.  We generally enter into long-term contracts with our clients ranging in duration from one to three years. Most of our contracts do not require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services from us. In general, our contracts with our customers are terminable on short notice with little or no penalty payable on termination.
Sales and Marketing
 
We rely on our enterprise and solution sellers to primarily sell our products and services to new clients and task our employees supporting existing clients to expand our client relationship through additional solutions and products. Our marketing services sales force sells a variety of solutions and services to address clients’ cross-selling targeted marketing needs. We maintain solution-specific sales forces and sales groups to sell our individual products and solutions. We currently have 12 employees in our sales and marketing function.
 
Facilities
 
Our services are provided at the following facilities, all of which are leased:
 

Domestic Offices | 
--------------------------------+-------------------------
Chelmsford, Massachusetts | Lenexa, Kansas 
Deerfield Beach, Florida | St. Petersburg, Florida 
East Bridgewater, Massachusetts | Trevose, Pennsylvania 
Kansas City, Kansas | 
International Offices | 
Hasselt, Belgium | Manila, Philippines 
Iasi, Romania | Uxbridge, United Kingdom

Competition
 
Our competition comes from local, national, and international marketing, advertising, customer care, print fulfillment, 3PL, and logistics companies, and internal client resources, against whom we compete for individual projects, entire client relationships, and marketing expenditures. Competitive factors in our industry include the quality and scope of services, technical and strategic expertise, the perceived value of the services provided, reputation, pricing, and brand recognition. We also compete against social, mobile, web-based, email, print, broadcast, and other forms of advertising for marketing and advertising dollars in general.  During 2022, we continued to see an increase in the insourcing of capabilities among our clients, which resulted in a decrease in revenues from these customers.  
 
Seasonality
 
Our revenues tend to be higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters during a given year. This increased revenue is a result of overall increased activity prior to and during the holiday season in the retail vertical and due to the open enrollment period in the healthcare vertical.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION  
 
As a company conducting varied business activities for clients across diverse industries around the world, we are subject to a variety of domestic and international legal and regulatory requirements that impact our business, including, for example, regulations governing consumer protection, and unfair business practices, contracts, e-commerce, intellectual property, labor, and employment (especially wage and hour laws), securities, tax, and other laws that are generally applicable to commercial activities.  We do not expect to need to make material capital expenditures to maintain compliance with government regulations.  
 
We are also subject to, or affected by, numerous local, national, and international laws, regulations, and industry standards that regulate direct marketing activities, including those that address privacy, data security, and unsolicited marketing communications. The most material of these laws and regulations that may be applied to, or affect, our business or the businesses of our clients include the following:
 

• | The Federal Trade Commission’s positions regarding the processing of personal information and consumer protection as expressed through its Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change, Data Brokers, Big Data and Cross-Device Tracking reports (each of which seek to address consumer privacy, data protection, and technological advancements related to the collection or use of personal information for marketing purposes).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data protection laws in the United States (“U.S.”) (which are generally state specific) and in the European Union (“EU”), including the General Data Protection Regulation (“EU Regulation 679/2016”), each of which imposes a number of obligations with respect to the processing of personal data, and with respect to EU Regulation 679/2016 also imposes prohibitions related to the transfer of personal information from the EU to other countries, including the United States, that do not provide data subjects with an “adequate” level of privacy or security, and applies to all of our products in the EU. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, also known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLB”), which, among other things, regulates the use for marketing purposes of non-public personal financial information of consumers held by financial institutions. Although Harte Hanks is not considered a financial institution, many of our clients are subject to the GLB. The GLB also includes rules relating to the physical, administrative, and technological protection of non-public personal financial information.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which regulates the use of protected health information for marketing purposes and requires reasonable safeguards designed to prevent intentional or unintentional use or disclosure of protected health information.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), which governs, among other things, the sharing of consumer report information, access to credit scores, and requirements for users of consumer report information.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACT Act”), which amended the FCRA and requires, among other things, consumer credit report notices for creditors that use consumer credit report information in connection with risk-based credit pricing actions and also prohibits a business that receives consumer information from an affiliate from using that information for marketing purposes unless the consumer is first provided a notice and an opportunity to request the business not to use the information for such marketing purposes, subject to certain exceptions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal and state laws governing the use of email for marketing purposes, including the U.S. Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (“CAN-SPAM”), Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (“CASL”) and similar e-Privacy laws in Europe (in support of Directive 2002/58/EC).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal and state laws governing the use of telephones for unsolicited marketing purposes, including the Federal Trade Commission’s Telemarketing Sales Rule (“TSR”), the Federal Communications Commission’s Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), various U.S. state do-not-call laws, Canada’s National Do Not Call laws and rules (“Telecommunications Act”) and similar e-Privacy laws in Europe (in support of Directive 2002/58/EC).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal and state laws governing the collection and use of personal data online and via mobile devices, including but not limited to the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which seek to address consumer privacy and protection.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal and state laws in the U.S., Canada, and Europe specific to data security and breach notification, which include required standards for data security and generally require timely notifications to affected persons in the event of data security breaches or other unauthorized access to certain types of protected personal data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
There are additional consumer protection, privacy, and data security regulations in locations where we or our clients do business. These laws regulate the collection, use, disclosure, and retention of personal data and may require consent from consumers and grant consumers other rights, such as the ability to access their personal data and to correct information in the possession of data controllers.  
 
    6 

  

As a result of increasing public awareness and interest in individual privacy rights, data protection, information security, and environmental and other concerns regarding marketing communications, federal, state, and foreign governmental and industry organizations continue to consider new legislative and regulatory proposals that would impose additional restrictions on direct marketing services and products. Examples include data encryption standards, data breach notification requirements, consumer choice and consent restrictions, and increased penalties against offending parties, among others.
 
In addition, our business, in general, and the way we do business in particular, may be affected by the impact of these restrictions on our clients and their marketing activities. These additional regulations could increase compliance requirements and restrict or prevent the collection, management, aggregation, transfer, use, or dissemination of information or data that is currently legally available. Additional regulations may also restrict or prevent current practices regarding unsolicited marketing communications. For example, many states have considered implementing “do-not-mail” legislation that could impact our business and the businesses of our clients and customers. In addition, continued public interest in individual privacy rights and data security may result in the adoption of further voluntary industry guidelines that could impact our direct marketing activities and business practices.
 
We cannot predict the scope of any new legislation, regulations, or industry guidelines or how courts may interpret existing and new laws. Additionally, enforcement priorities by governmental authorities may change and impact our business either directly or through requiring our customers to alter their practices. Compliance with regulations is costly and time-consuming for us and our clients, and we may encounter difficulties, delays, or significant expenses in connection with our compliance. We may also be exposed to significant penalties, liabilities, reputational harm, and loss of business if we fail to comply with applicable regulations. There could be a material adverse impact on our business due to the enactment or enforcement of legislation or industry regulations, the issuance of judicial or governmental interpretations, enforcement priorities of governmental agencies, or a change in customs arising from public concern over consumer privacy and data security issues.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
 
Our intellectual property assets include trademarks and service marks that identify our company and our services, know-how, software, and other technology that we develop for our internal use and for license to clients and data and intellectual property licensed from third parties, such as commercial software and data providers. We generally seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of license agreements and trademark, service mark, copyright, and trade secret laws as well as through domain name registrations and enforcement procedures. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with many of our employees, vendors, and clients and seek to limit access to and distribution of intellectual property and other proprietary information. We pursue the protection of our trademarks and other intellectual property in the U.S. and internationally. Although we from time to time evaluate inventions for patentability, we do not own any patents, and patents are not core to our intellectual property strategy (other than as may be incidental to commercially available technology or software we license).
 
We have developed proprietary software including NexTOUCH and Allink®360, each of which are integral to our business. NexTOUCH is key to the success of our print and product fulfillment business while Allink®360 ensures customers' products are delivered on-time and on-budget.
 
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
As of December 31, 2022, Harte Hanks employed 1,881 full-time employees and 823 part-time employees, of which approximately 1,646 are based outside of the U.S., primarily in the Philippines. A portion of our workforce is provided to us through staffing companies. None of our workforce is represented by labor unions. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
