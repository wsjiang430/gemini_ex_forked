Organization and Nature of Business
 
The Company was incorporated as Conceptualistics, Inc. on January 6, 1988 in Delaware. Subsequent to its incorporation, the Company changed its name to Eat at Joe’s, Ltd. In February 2015, the Company changed its name to SPYR, Inc. and adopted a new ticker symbol “SPYR” effective March 12, 2015.
 
The Company’s common stock is traded on OTC Markets under the symbol “SPYR.”
 
The primary focus of SPYR, Inc. (the “Company”) is to act as a holding company and develop a portfolio of profitable subsidiaries, not limited by any particular industry or business.
 
The Company has the following wholly owned subsidiaries:
 

· | SPYR APPS, LLC a Nevada Limited Liability Company;
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | E.A.J.: PHL, Airport Inc. a Pennsylvania corporation; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------

On March 24, 2015, the Company organized its wholly owned subsidiary SPYR APPS, LLC, (“Apps”) a Nevada Limited Liability Company. The focus of the SPYR APPS subsidiary is the development and publication of our own mobile games as well as the publication of games developed by third-party developers.
 
Operating Losses
 
The Company has incurred net losses from operations of $7,110,000 and $15,643,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Such operating losses reflect developmental and other administrative costs for 2018 and 2017. The Company expects to incur losses in the near future until profitability is achieved. The Company’s operations are subject to numerous risks associated with establishing any new business, including unforeseen expenses, delays and complications. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve or sustain profitable operations.
Future Capital Needs and Uncertainty of Additional Funding
 
Revenues are not yet sufficient to support the Company’s operating expenses and are not expected to reach such levels until the Company completes its expansion plans of building a portfolio of mobile games published and/or developed under its umbrella.
Our Business and Strategy
 
Our current strategy is to publish and market games developed by third-party developers with the potential to develop our own games, either by contracting with third-party developers or by building or acquiring an in-house development team and to acquire revenue-producing games or companies. As of the date of this annual report, we have not built or acquired an in-house development team but are currently in the process of exploring acquisitions in the mobile games space that would include a development team. We intend to generate revenues from the games based upon users paying for additional features and levels of game play, and from the sale of advertising in our games. Our games use the “free to play” model, which allows users to download the games onto their devices and play them at no cost. “Free to play” is a business model that has existed in videogames (and other industries) for quite some time but one that has, in the last 3-5 years, been adopted by a large number of game developers and publishers both big and small. The “free to play” model allows us to offer games that have zero cost barriers preventing players from trying our games. Players that choose to not continue with the game nonetheless still become marketing channels to their friends, who may become a critical mass of players who do choose to pay for optional aspects of the games, including customization, faster game progress, additional content and more effective competition against other players. There are no limitations on potential purchases, thus catering to the financial capabilities/preferences of all players. We monetize the games by offering features and opportunities within the games that allow players to spend money to unlock new game levels, items and features, as well as in game advertising.

Our Games
 
Contracting with a third-party developer, we released three games: “Plucky,” “Plucky Rush” and Rune Guardian in April, May and December 2015, respectively. They are available for free download on mobile devices in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
 
We entered into our first publication and marketing agreement on October 21, 2015 with Superplus Games Oy for the publication of “Retro Shot.” “Retro Shot” was fully launched in February of 2016 and is available for free download on mobile devices in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
 
We entered into our second publishing and marketing agreement on December 17, 2015 with Spectacle Games Publishing (“Spectacle Games”), for its “Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game,” “Pocket Starships,” which is available in Google Play Store and the Amazon App Store for free download, and can also be played in a web browser, via hundreds of web portals around the world or on Facebook’s “Game Room” and VK.com.
 
Pocket Starships is a space warfare themed game that is available to be played regardless of what operating system the player uses, whether that is a Google Android device, including phones and tablets from a variety of hardware manufacturers using the Android operating system, or an Amazon Fire OS device such as a Kindle. Pocket Starships is also available to play on the Internet in any web browser at www.pocketstarships.com. Pocket Starships’ software engine allows players worldwide to play against each other in real time and in the same game “universe,” regardless of what platform is used. Thus, players can play Pocket Starships in the same game universe regardless of whether they are playing in a web browser at their desk or using an iPhone on the other side of the planet. Pocket Starships’ game play is hardware and software agnostic, so regardless of device all users have the same game experience.
 
In June 2016, we obtained an exclusive option to purchase all assets pertaining to Pocket Starships (the “Option”) in consideration for 3,750,000 cash-based options, exercisable as follows: (a) 500,000 shares at $1.00 per share, expiring on December 31, 2017; (b) 750,000 shares at $2.50 per share, expiring on December 31, 2018; and (c) 2,500,000 shares at $5.00 per share, expiring on December 31, 2019. Under the Option, had the Company decided to exercise the Option, it would have purchased the assets for a cash payment of $5,000,000 plus $10,000,000 worth of shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at the time of closing of the purchase. The exclusive Option was exercisable by us at any time, in our sole discretion, through December 31, 2020.
 
On October 23, 2017, we restructured and exercised the Option by entering into a definitive agreement pursuant to which SPYR® acquired all of the game related assets of Pocket Starships in a cashless transaction, including the publishing agreement with Spectacle. The original terms of the Option were terminated. As a result, SPYR® acquired rights to retain 100% of the revenue generated from the game and will be the sole owner of all of the assets related to the game. The acquisition included, among other assets, all Pocket Starships related intellectual property, the userbase, artwork, software, internet domains, game store accounts (such as App Store, Play Store, Amazon, and Facebook Gameroom), web portal accounts (Facebook, VK.com, Kongregate, etc.) and internet domains (www.pocketstarships.com). Under the terms of the agreement, the game's owner received 8,000,000 restricted shares of SPYR® stock (subject to resale gating provisions) and 8,000,000 three-year cash-based options exercisable at $0.50 per share.
 
During 2017, we signed an agreement with CBS Consumer Products that will allow the incorporation of intellectual property (IP) from various Star Trek television series into future Pocket Starships updates and expansions. In Pocket Starships, players can build and pilot several ships and forge alliances on their quest for galactic domination. Players can perform or initiate various activities ranging from fighting pirates to participating in Faction Alerts. With the future release of an expansion, those playing Pocket Starships will be able to explore new sectors and engage in exciting battles with the Borg and will be able to staff their ships with their favorite Star Trek characters from the Star Trek TV series franchise – including The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager, through a trading card expansion.

During July 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Reset Studios, LLC for the development of new idle tapper game called Steven Universe: Tap Together, which features characters and storylines from Cartoon Network’s Steven Universe. The Company has secured the necessary license to use the Steven Universe IP in the game through a license agreement with Cartoon Network. The game allows players to play as a team of their favorite Steven Universe characters to battle increasingly difficult enemies in order to unlock new characters and rewards. By performing simple actions such as tapping the screen, players can progress in the game even when they’re not actively playing. Steven Universe: Tap Together was launched globally on the Google Play Store on August 2, 2018 and on the IOS App Store on August 9, 2018.
 
The Company intends to utilize cash on hand, shareholder loans and other forms of financing such as the sale of additional equity and debt securities, capital leases and other credit facilities to conduct its ongoing business, and to also conduct strategic business development, marketing analysis, due diligence investigations into possible acquisitions, and software development costs and implementation of our business plans generally. The Company may also decide to diversify, through acquisition or otherwise, in other unrelated business areas if opportunities present themselves.
 
Government Regulation
 
The Company is subject to all pertinent federal, state, local, and international laws governing its business. Each subsidiary is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of authorities in its State or municipality. These may include health, safety, and fire regulations. The Company’s operations are also subject to Federal and State minimum wage laws governing such matters as working conditions, overtime and tip credits.
Competition
 
The mobile game market is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Our ability to compete depends upon many factors within and outside our control, including the timely development and introduction of the mobile games we publish and market, and the related enhancements, functionality, performance, reliability, customer service and support and marketing efforts. Due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the mobile game market, we expect additional competition from other emerging companies. Many of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger than us and have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources that will compete for available users, developers, talent and third-party games. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the publishing and promotion of their mobile games. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 4 employees, none of whom is represented by a labor union.
