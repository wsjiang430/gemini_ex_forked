Item 1.  Business.
General

We are a Maryland REIT engaged in owning and operating commercial properties in culturally diverse markets in major metropolitan areas. Founded in 1998, we changed our state of organization from Texas to Maryland in December 2003.  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).

We are internally managed and, as of December 31, 2018, we wholly-owned a real estate portfolio of 57 properties that meet our Community Centered Property® strategy containing approximately 4.8 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”), located in Texas, Arizona and Illinois.  Our consolidated property portfolio has a gross book value of approximately $1.1 billion and book equity, including noncontrolling interests, of approximately $359 million as of December 31, 2018.
Further, as of December 31, 2018, we, through our investment in Pillarstone OP, owned a majority interest in 11 properties that do not meet our Community Centered Property® strategy containing approximately 1.3 million square feet of GLA (the “Pillarstone Properties”). We own 81.4% of the total outstanding units of Pillarstone OP, which we account for using the equity method. We also manage the day-to-day operations of Pillarstone OP. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated, we do not include the Pillarstone Properties when we refer to our properties.
Our common shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.001 per share, are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “WSR.” Our offices are located at 2600 South Gessner, Suite 500, Houston, Texas 77063.  Our telephone number is (713) 827-9595 and we maintain a website at www.whitestonereit.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated into this filing.

Our Strategy

In October 2006, our current management team joined the Company and adopted a strategic plan to acquire, redevelop, own and operate Community Centered Properties®. We define Community Centered Properties® as visibly located properties in established or developing culturally diverse neighborhoods in our target markets. We market, lease and manage our centers to match tenants with the shared needs of the surrounding neighborhood. Those needs may include specialty retail, grocery, restaurants and medical, educational and financial services. Our goal is for each property to become a Whitestone-branded retail community that serves a neighboring five-mile radius around our property. We employ and develop a diverse group of associates who understand the needs of our multicultural communities and tenants.
Our primary business objective is to increase shareholder value by acquiring, owning and operating Community Centered Properties®. The key elements of our strategy include:


• | Strategically Acquiring Properties.


◦ | Seeking High Growth Markets. We seek to strategically acquire commercial properties in high-growth markets. Our acquisition targets are located in densely populated, culturally diverse neighborhoods, primarily in and around Austin, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Phoenix and San Antonio. 


◦ | Diversifying Geographically. Our current portfolio is concentrated in Houston and Phoenix. As of December 31, 2018, we wholly-owned 57 commercial properties, including 15 properties in Houston, seven properties in Dallas-Fort Worth, three properties in San Antonio, four properties in Austin, 27 properties in the Scottsdale and Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan areas, and one property in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. 

We believe that continued geographic diversification in markets where we have substantial knowledge and experience will help offset the economic risk from a single market concentration. We intend to continue to focus our expansion efforts on the Austin, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Phoenix and San Antonio markets. We believe our management infrastructure and capacity can accommodate substantial growth in those markets. We may also pursue opportunities in other regions that are consistent with our Community Centered Property® strategy. Markets in which we have developed some knowledge and contacts include Orlando, Florida and Denver, Colorado, both of which have economic, demographic and cultural profiles similar to our Arizona and Texas markets.

◦ | Capitalizing on Availability of Reasonably Priced Acquisition Opportunities. We believe that currently and during the next several years there will continue to be excellent opportunities in our target markets to acquire quality properties at historically attractive prices. We intend to acquire assets in off-market transactions negotiated directly with owners or financial institutions holding foreclosed real estate and debt instruments that are either in default or on bank watch lists. Many of these assets may benefit from our Community Centered Property® strategy and our management team’s experience in turning around distressed properties, portfolios and companies. We have extensive relationships with community banks, attorneys, title companies and others in the real estate industry with whom we regularly work to identify properties for potential acquisition. 


• | Redeveloping and Re-tenanting Existing Properties. We have substantial experience in repositioning underperforming properties and seek to add value through renovating and re-tenanting our properties to create Whitestone-branded Community Centered Properties®. We seek to accomplish this by (1) stabilizing occupancy, with per property occupancy goals of 90% or higher; (2) adding leasable square footage to existing structures; (3) developing and building new leasable square footage on excess land; (4) upgrading and renovating existing structures; and (5) investing significant effort in recruiting tenants whose goods and services meet the needs of the surrounding neighborhood. 


• | Recycling Capital for Greater Returns. We seek to continually upgrade our portfolio by opportunistically selling properties that do not have the potential to meet our Community Centered Property® strategy and redeploying the sale proceeds into properties that better fit our strategy. Some of our properties that we owned at the time our current management team assumed the management of the Company (the “Legacy Portfolio” or “Non-Core Properties”) may not fit our Community Centered Property® strategy, and we may look for opportunities to dispose of these properties as we continue to execute our strategy. For example, on December 31, 2016, we contributed to Pillarstone the 14 Pillarstone Properties located in Dallas and Houston that were part of the Legacy Portfolio. 


• | Prudent Management of Capital Structure. Of our 57 properties, we currently have 48 properties that are unencumbered. We may seek to add mortgage indebtedness to existing and newly acquired unencumbered properties to provide additional capital for acquisitions. As a general policy, we intend to maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to undepreciated book value of real estate assets that is at or less than 60%. As of December 31, 2018, our ratio of total indebtedness to undepreciated book value of real estate assets was 58%. 


• | Investing in People. We believe that our people are the heart of our culture, philosophy and strategy. We continually focus on developing associates who are self-disciplined and motivated and display, at all times, a high degree of character and competence. We provide them with equity incentives to align their interests with those of our shareholders. 

Our Structure

Substantially all of our business is conducted through Whitestone REIT Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership organized in 1998 (the “Operating Partnership”).  We are the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership.  As of December 31, 2018, we owned a 97.7% interest in the Operating Partnership.
As of December 31, 2018, we wholly-owned a real estate portfolio consisting of 57 properties located in three states.  The aggregate occupancy rate of our portfolio was 90% based on GLA as of December 31, 2018. 
We are hands-on owners who directly manage the operations and leasing of our properties.  Substantially all of our revenues consist of base rents received under varying term leases.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, our total revenues were approximately $119.9 million.  
Additionally, we, through our investment in Pillarstone, owned a majority interest in 11 properties located in Dallas and Houston, Texas. The aggregate occupancy rate of the Pillarstone properties was 80% based on GLA as of December 31, 2018.

Our largest property, BLVD Place (“BLVD”), a retail community purchased on May 26, 2017 and located in Houston, Texas, accounted for 12.7% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. BLVD also accounted for 17.4% of our consolidated real estate assets, net of accumulated depreciation, as of the year ended December 31, 2018. Of our 57 properties, 15 and 27 are located in the Houston, Texas and Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan areas, respectively.

Economic Environment
Low interest rates and desire for higher yielding investments with moderate risk has resulted in lower capitalization rates and higher prices for commercial real estate acquisitions. Each of these factors could negatively impact the value of public real estate companies, including ours.  However, the majority of our retail properties are located in densely populated metropolitan areas and are occupied by tenants that generally provide basic necessity-type items and services which have tended to be less affected by economic changes.  Furthermore, a substantial portion of our portfolio is in metropolitan areas in Texas that have been impacted less by the economic slowdown compared to other metropolitan areas.
Competition

All of our properties are located in areas that include competing properties.  The amount of competition in a particular area could impact our ability to acquire additional real estate, sell current real estate, lease space and the amount of rent we are able to charge.  We may be competing with owners, developers and operators, including, but not limited to, real estate investors, other REITs, insurance companies and pension funds.
Should we decide to dispose of a property, we may compete with third-party sellers of similar types of commercial properties for suitable purchasers, which may result in our receiving lower net proceeds from a sale or in our not being able to dispose of such property at a time of our choosing due to the lack of an acceptable return. In operating and managing our properties, we compete for tenants based upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, location, rental rates, security, flexibility, expertise to design space to meet prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated, maintained and marketed. We may be required to provide rent concessions, incur charges for tenant improvements and other inducements, or we may not be able to timely lease vacant space, all of which could adversely impact our results of operations. 
Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than us and also may have more operating experience. Generally, there are other neighborhood and community retail centers within relatively close proximity to each of our properties. There is, however, no dominant competitor in the Austin, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Phoenix and San Antonio metropolitan areas. Our retail tenants also face increasing competition from outlet malls, internet retailers, catalog companies, direct mail and telemarketing. 
Compliance with Governmental Regulations

Under various federal and state environmental laws and regulations, as an owner or operator of real estate, we may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances, asbestos-containing materials, or petroleum product releases at our properties. We may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by those parties in connection with any such contamination. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on a contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with contamination on the site. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the properties or to borrow using the properties as collateral. We could also be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination coming from our properties.
We will not purchase any property unless we are generally satisfied with the environmental status of the property. We typically obtain a Phase I environmental site assessment for each new acquisition, which includes a visual survey of the building and the property in an attempt to identify areas of potential environmental concerns, visually observing neighboring properties to assess surface conditions or activities that may have an adverse environmental impact on the property, and contacting local governmental agency personnel and performing a regulatory agency file search in an attempt to determine any known environmental concerns in the immediate vicinity of the property. A Phase I environmental site assessment does not include any sampling or testing of soil, groundwater or building materials from the property.

We believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding the handling, discharge and emission of hazardous or toxic substances. Because release of chlorinated solvents can occur as a result of dry cleaning operations, we participate in the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Dry Cleaner Remediation Program (“DCRP”) with respect to four of our properties that currently or previously had a dry cleaning facility as a tenant. The DCRP administers the Dry Cleaning Remediation fund to assist with remediation of contamination caused by dry cleaning solvents.

We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances in connection with any of our present or former properties. Nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments conducted thus far and currently available to us do not reveal all potential environmental liabilities. It is also possible that subsequent investigations will identify material contamination or other adverse conditions, that adverse environmental conditions have arisen subsequent to the performance of the environmental assessments, or that there are material environmental liabilities of which management is unaware.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Our properties must comply with the ADA to the extent that they are considered “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. In addition, we will continue to assess our compliance with the ADA and to make alterations to our properties as required.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had 98 employees.
