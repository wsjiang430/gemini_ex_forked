Our Corporate Structure 



We do not have or intend to set up any subsidiary or enter into any contractual arrangements to establish a variable interest entity (“VIE”) structure with any entity in China. The following diagram illustrates our corporate structure, including our subsidiaries as of the date of this Report:






Our holding company structure presents unique risks as our investors may never directly hold equity interests in our Hong Kong or Shenzhen operating subsidiary and will be dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to finance our cash flow needs. We are, however, not a Chinese or Hong Kong operating company but a United States holding company with operations conducted by our subsidiaries. Our ability to receive dividends and other contributions from our subsidiaries are significantly affected by regulations promulgated by Hong Kong and PRC authorities. Any change in the interpretation of existing rules and regulations or the promulgation of new rules and regulations may materially affect our operations and or the value of our securities, including causing the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.
