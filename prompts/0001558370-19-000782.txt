 Item 1.    Business
 Overview
 Prior to July 1, 2018, Grand Canyon Education, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“GCE” or the “Company”), operated Grand Canyon University (the “University”), a comprehensive regionally accredited university that offers graduate and undergraduate degree programs, emphases and certificates across nine colleges both online and on ground at its campus in Phoenix, Arizona, at leased facilities and at facilities owned by third party employers of its students. On July 1, 2018, the Company sold the University to Grand Canyon University, an independent Arizona non-profit corporation formerly known as Gazelle University (“GCU”), as further described below (the “Transaction”). As a result of this Transaction, GCE became an educational services company focused on providing a full array of support services to institutions in the post-secondary education sector. GCE has developed significant technological solutions, infrastructure and operational processes to provide services to these institutions on a large scale.
 During the second half of 2018, GCE provided services to GCU, its sole services client during 2018, that included technology and academic services, counseling services and support, marketing and communication services, and back office services such as financial aid processing, accounting, reporting, tax, human resources, and procurement services.
 References herein to “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company” and “GCE” refer to Grand Canyon Education, Inc.; references to the “University” refer to the accredited academic institution that we used to operate; references to “Grand Canyon University” or “GCU” refer to our client.
 The Transaction
 On July 1, 2018, the Company consummated an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with GCU.  Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement:

· | The Company transferred to GCU the real property and improvements comprising the University campus as well as tangible and intangible academic and related operations and assets related to the University (the “Transferred Assets”), and GCU assumed liabilities related to the Transferred Assets. Accordingly, GCU now owns and operates the University. The Asset Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and indemnities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The final purchase price that GCU paid for the Transferred Assets at closing (and after giving effect to a post-closing adjustment as provided in the Asset Purchase Agreement) was $870.1 million. The final purchase price was equal to the book value of the tangible Transferred Assets as of July 1, 2018, plus $1.00 for the intangible Transferred Assets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | GCU paid the purchase price for the Transferred Assets by issuing to the Company a senior secured note (the “Secured Note”) that is governed by a credit agreement between the Company and GCU (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement contains customary commercial credit terms, including affirmative and negative covenants applicable to GCU, and provides that the Secured Note bears interest at an annual rate of 6.0%, has a maturity date of June 30, 2025, and is secured by all of the assets of GCU. The Secured Note provides for GCU to make interest only payments during the term, with all principal and accrued and unpaid interest due at maturity and also provides that the Company will loan additional amounts to GCU to fund approved capital expenditures during the first three years of the term on the terms set forth therein.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In connection with the closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company and GCU entered into a long-term master services agreement (the “Master Services Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company provides identified technology and academic services, counseling services and support, marketing and communication services, and several back office services to GCU in return for 60% of GCU’s tuition and fee revenue. The Master Services Agreement has an initial term of fifteen (15) years, subject to renewal
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

options, although GCU has the right to terminate the Master Services Agreement early after the later of seven (7) years or the payment in full of the Secured Note. If GCU were to terminate the Master Services Agreement early, then GCU would be required to pay the Company a termination fee equal to one-hundred percent (100%) of the fees paid in the trailing twelve (12) month period. If the Master Services Agreement were not renewed after the initial fifteen (15) year term, GCU would be required to pay the Company a non-renewal fee equal to fifty percent (50%) of the fees paid in the trailing twelve (12) month period.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As a result of the Transaction, effective July 1, 2018, various aspects of the Company’s operations changed in important ways. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Change in the Structure of Our Operations.” The results of operations for the annual periods discussed herein reflect that, prior to July 1, 2018, the Company’s business involved exclusively the operations of the University, and that, upon and following July 1, 2018, the Company’s business was that of a services provider to GCU pursuant to the Master Services Agreement. In July 2018, as a result of the Transaction, the Company made changes in its presentation of operating expenses and reclassified prior periods to conform to the current presentation. The Company determined that these changes would provide more meaningful information as this new presentation provides transparency for costs that will be incurred as a service provider and costs that will not reoccur in the future as they are related to university expenses that were transferred to GCU in the Transaction.
 Our net revenue and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $845.5 million and $258.1 million, respectively, representing decreases of 13.2% and 8.7%, respectively, over the year ended December 31, 2017. Our net revenue and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $974.1 million and $282.8 million, respectively, representing increases of 11.5% and 19.2%, respectively, over the year ended December 31, 2016. The reduction in our net revenue from 2017 to 2018 is driven by the Company’s transition from owning and operating the University to becoming an education services provider as of July 1, 2018.  As an education services provider to GCU, the Company receives, as service revenue, 60% of GCU’s tuition and fee revenue and no longer has university related revenue, thus resulting in the decrease from the prior period.  On a comparable basis, as adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $640.5 million, while as adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $584.5 million.  For information on how we calculate as adjusted net revenue for comparison purposes, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Results of Operations.”  The 9.6% increase year over year in comparable revenue was primarily due to an increase in GCU’s enrollment and, to a lesser extent, an increase in GCU’s ancillary revenue (e.g. from housing, food, etc.) resulting from the increased traditional student enrollment, partially offset by an increase in institutional scholarships.  End-of-period enrollment at our client, GCU, increased 7.8% between December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 to 97,369 from 90,297.
 Our Business
 For all periods prior to the Transaction, the Company owned and operated the University. The following describes the business of GCU, as it was conducted by the Company prior to the Transaction and as it is conducted currently as an educational service provider.
 Pre-Transaction Operations. GCU owns and operates a comprehensive regionally accredited university that offers over 240 graduate and undergraduate degree programs, emphases and certificates across nine colleges both online and on ground at its over 275 acre campus in Phoenix, Arizona, at leased facilities and at facilities owned by third party employers. GCU’s undergraduate programs are designed to be innovative and to meet the future needs of employers, while providing students with the needed critical thinking and effective communication skills developed through a Christian-oriented, liberal arts foundation. GCU offers master’s and doctoral degrees in contemporary fields that are designed to provide students with the capacity for transformational leadership in their chosen industry, emphasizing the immediate relevance of theory, application, and evaluation to promote personal and organizational change. GCU is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission (“HLC”); it was reaccredited in 2017 by the HLC for the maximum term of ten years after a comprehensive review of the institution’s academic offerings, governance and administration, mission, finances and resources that occurred during 2016, with no requirement for any monitoring or interim reports.

 GCU owns and operates a ground campus, which is located on over 275 acres in the center of the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area, near downtown Phoenix. The on-campus facilities consist of 10 classroom buildings and lecture halls, 21 residence halls, 6 parking garages, a 300‑seat theater, a 29,000 square foot newly renovated library, a 55,000 square foot recreation center that has state of the art training facilities for our over 400 student-athletes and students, a 140,000 square foot/ 7,500 seat basketball and entertainment arena, a stadium that hosts NCAA men’s and women’s soccer as well as several club sports programs and newly renovated baseball and softball stadiums. Additionally, GCU operates the off-campus Grand Canyon University Championship Golf Course and the Grand Canyon University Hotel. GCU has 21 intercollegiate athletic teams that compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (“NCAA”).  On July 1, 2018, in connection with the Transaction, GCE sold the campus to GCU.
 Operations as an Educational Services Provider. Beginning July 1, 2018, GCE became a full service educational services provider with one client, GCU. We have invested over $200 million in the last ten years to develop systems that automate key processes and enable us to scale these processes to hundreds of thousands of students. GCE is capable of supporting not just core academic functions, technology and marketing but many additional key processes that surround those functions, such as faculty recruiting and training, admissions, financial aid, accounting, and technical support. While GCE has never operated as a third party service provider until now, all of the services that it provides to GCU under the Master Services Agreement are services that it had always provided internally in support of the University’s academic operations prior to the Transaction. As a result, while GCE has limited to no experience operating as a service provider to third parties, it believes that its significant investment in technological solutions, infrastructure and processes to provide superior service to students, its experience and expertise in these services areas, its experience providing such services at the scale required for GCU to continue to operate in a manner consistent with past practices, and the fact that it retained all of the assets and employees involved in the delivery of such services enables it to perform in the manner and to the service levels required under the Master Services Agreement and also positions GCE to engage and provide services to additional university customers in the future.
 For the period from July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, GCU was our only university client. On January 22, 2019, GCE completed the acquisition of Orbis Education Services, LLC (“Orbis Education”), an educational services company that supports healthcare education programs for 17 universities across the United States. See Note 14 – Subsequent Event to consolidated financial statements.

  Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, GCE employed approximately 2,800 professional and administrative personnel, including technical and academic advisors, counseling advisors, marketing and communication professionals, and personnel that handle financial aid processing, information technology, human resources, corporate accounting, finance, and other administrative functions. In addition, at December 31, 2018, GCE employed approximately 700 part-time employees most of which are student workers. None of our employees are a party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement with us. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Community Involvement and the Public Good
 The Company had developed and is executing on a five-point plan to revitalize its West Phoenix neighborhood in partnership with its client, GCU.
 Increased home values. Together with Habitat for Humanity, we are participating in the largest home renovation project in the country in the West Phoenix area surrounding GCU’s campus. As of December 31, 2018, 221 different projects have been completed. These efforts, combined with GCU’s expanded presence in the community, resulted in a significant increase in home values in the 85017 zip code.
 Improved safety. We are in the seventh year of a $1.6 million partnership with City of Phoenix Police Department that focuses on improving safety and reducing crime in the communities surrounding the campus. Since the initiation of this program, crime has decreased substantially in the two-mile radius surrounding the University.
 Job creation. At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 3,500 persons (including 700 part-time employees and student workers), which is approximately three times more persons than were employed by GCE in comparable positions ten years ago. We have launched a number of new business enterprises that reduced costs for the 

 
  10

 
University, provided management opportunities for recent GCU graduates and employment opportunities for students and neighborhood residents, while spurring economic growth in the area.
 GCE and GCU continue to partner in countless community events and projects throughout the year, helping organizations such as the Phoenix Rescue Mission, Feed My Starving Children, Arizona Foster Care, Boy/Girl Scouts, Goodwill Arizona, St. Vincent de Paul, Young Life, Elevate Phoenix, Back to School Clothing Drive and St. Mary’s Food Bank. Our employees also went out into our surrounding neighborhoods to participate in GCU-sponsored programs such as Serve the City, Canyon Kids, Salute Our Troops, Colter Commons senior home visits and the Run to Fight Children’s Cancer.
 The Company also invests in the following activities that benefit the community.
 Student Tuition Organization contributions. The Company contributes to private school tuition organizations and in 2018 increased its annual contribution to $3.7 million from $2.0 million in 2017. Financial contributions are allocated toward tuition assistance and awarding Arizona students with scholarships to attend Arizona private schools.
 Donate to Elevate. Donate to Elevate is a program that allows employees to contribute money in lieu of state income tax payments to three projects. This program benefits private schools in Arizona and the partnership with Habitat for Humanity, as well as local public schools and public charter schools through extracurricular activities that require students to pay a fee. Employees are encouraged to designate tax dollars to the school or program of their choice.
 Students Inspiring Students. The Company continues to support GCU’s free tutoring/mentoring program that serves Phoenix-area K‑12 schools. Students who seek academic assistance in the GCU Learning Lounge may become eligible to receive the Students Inspiring Students full-tuition scholarship. To serve its client and community, the Company seeks donations to fund this neighborhood scholarship program.
 Sponsoring K‑12 Educational Development. The Company supports its client’s K‑12 Educational Development Department through sponsorship of GCU’s Canyon Professional Development and K‑12 Targeted School Assistance programs. Canyon Professional Development offers professional development opportunities for educators and administrators, and their student/parent engagement programs aim to help students become college ready. K‑12 Targeted School Assistance programs also offer tutoring and mentorship and more to community schools to improve learning environments and outcomes. Both initiatives elevate public, private, charter and home schools in the form of scholarships, program discounts, professional development, events, and more.
 Employee Opportunities for Community Service. The Company’s charitable contribution program offers its full-time employees a maximum of 16 hours of PTO annually for community service. This time is used to volunteer at an approved charitable organization. Over 40 organizations are approved for employee volunteerism, including Habitat for Humanity.
 The Company’s employees continue to share a commitment to and enthusiasm for GCU-sponsored community service projects, as well as charitable organizations throughout the Valley. Through these activities, our employees have the opportunity to volunteer and provide servant leadership that benefits the surrounding neighborhoods and West Phoenix community.
 Seasonality
 Our net revenue and operating results normally fluctuate due to changes in GCU’s enrollment. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Seasonality.”  Competition
 There are dozens of companies that seek to partner with non-profit schools and state universities to assist in the development and operation of their educational programs. These companies provide various services that traditional institutions historically have not had the experience or organizational capability to fully support. These services include 

 
  11

 
marketing and recruitment, enrollment management, curriculum development, online course design, student retention support, technology infrastructure, and student and faculty call center support. Among the largest companies in this sector are 2U, Pearson Online Learning Services, and Wiley Education Services.
 The educational services market, particularly with regard to those companies that help traditional universities develop online degree programs (and often referred to as online program management, or OPM, providers), has historically been characterized by a full-service, revenue-sharing model, based on the premise that most traditional institutions are not only operationally unprepared to offer online programs at scale but also are not equipped to make the significant upfront investments necessary to develop online programs organically. In recent years, an alternative unbundled fee-for-service OPM model has emerged, in which the companies offer the same services, or some subset of services, for the market price of those services. Finally, other industry providers affiliate with university partners to offer massive open online courses, which are aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the web at little or no cost to the student.
 The educational services market is changing and expanding. It is highly fragmented and subject to evolving technology, shifting needs of students and educators and introductions of new delivery modalities. We believe that the competitive factors in the educational services market include:

· | reputation and brand awareness;
--+--------------------------------


· | quality of university client base and performance track record;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | robustness and evolution of technology solutions;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | breadth and depth of services offerings;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | convenient, flexible and dependable access to programs and classes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | level of student support services;
--+-----------------------------------


· | quality of student and faculty experience;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | cost of programs; and
--+----------------------


· | the time necessary to earn a degree.

 REGULATION
 Through June 30, 2018, we were the owner and operator of a for-profit university.  Upon the consummation of the Transaction with GCU on July 1, 2018 (as discussed in “Part I. Business – The Transaction”), we became a third party provider of education services to GCU, our only university client during 2018.  On January 22, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Orbis Education, an educational services company that supports healthcare education programs for 17 universities across the United States.  See Note 14 – Subsequent Event to consolidated financial statements.  While we currently provide services to 18 university clients across the United States, GCU is, and will for the foreseeable future remain, our most significant client, and regulatory matters that materially affect GCU will, necessarily, have a material impact on us.  The following section describes regulatory matters that affect us as a service provider to GCU and to institutions of higher education generally. Overview
 Institutions of higher education in America are subject to extensive regulation by state post-secondary, licensure and certification agencies, accrediting commissions, and the federal government through the United States Department of Education (“ED”) under the Higher Education Act (“HEA”). The regulations, standards, and policies of these agencies cover the vast majority of operations of colleges and universities, including educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, athletics and financial condition.
 The HEA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are frequently revised, repealed or expanded. Congress historically has reauthorized and amended the HEA in regular intervals, approximately every five to seven years. The re-authorization process is currently under way. The re-authorization of the HEA could alter the regulatory landscape of the higher education industry, and thereby impact the manner in which we conduct business and serve our university clients. In addition, ED is independently conducting an ongoing series of rulemakings intended to assure the integrity of the Title IV programs. ED also frequently issues formal and informal guidance instructing institutions of higher education and other covered entities how to comply with various federal laws and regulations. ED guidance is subject to frequent change and may impact our business model.
 As a result of the Transaction, we no longer own and operate an institution of higher education, nor do we directly participate in Title IV programs.  Instead, we operate as a service provider to institutions of higher education that do participate in Title IV programs.  Nevertheless, we are required to comply with certain regulations promulgated by ED for the following reasons:

· | Our operations are subject to regulation by ED due to our clients’ participation in the federal student financial aid programs under Title IV of the HEA. Those Title IV programs include educational loans with below-market interest rates that are issued by the federal government under the Federal Direct Loan program (the “FDL Program”), as well as grant programs for students with demonstrated financial need. To

participate in the Title IV programs, a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state agency or agencies, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by ED, and be certified as an eligible institution by ED.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As a third-party servicer under the HEA and the related regulations, we have a direct relationship with ED. We anticipate that ED will regulate our operations insofar as we are performing certain functions classified as third-party servicer functions under relevant regulations and sub-regulatory guidance. A “Third-party servicer” is any person or entity used by “any eligible institution of higher education to administer, through either manual or automated processing, any aspect of such institution’s student assistance programs.” Third party servicers must comply with a number of regulatory requirements. For example, they must conduct and submit to ED compliance audits under 34 C.F.R. § 668.23. In addition, they must comply with the requirements of 34 C.F.R. § 668.25, which among other things, requires third-party servicers, in their contracts with institutions, to be contractually obligated to, among other things: 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Comply with all statutory provisions of or applicable to Title IV of the HEA, including the requirement to use any funds that the servicer administers under any Title IV, HEA program and any interest or other earnings thereon solely for the purposes specified in and in accordance with that program;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Refer to the Office of Inspector General of ED for investigation any information indicating there is reasonable cause to believe that the institution might have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct in connection with the institution’s administration of any Title IV, HEA program or an applicant for Title IV, HEA program assistance might have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct in connection with his or her application; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Be jointly and severally liable with the institution to the Secretary for any violation by the servicer of any statutory provision of or applicable to Title IV of the HEA, any regulatory provision prescribed under that statutory authority, and any applicable special arrangement, agreement, or limitation entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We are also subject to a number of data security and privacy regulations given our role as a third-party service provider.  To the extent we continue to provide third party servicer functions, we will be subject to these requirements, the compliance with which can materially impact our business model.
 Finally, our current clients and all likely future clients are required to be authorized by appropriate state post-secondary, licensure, and certification authorities.  In addition, in order to participate in the federal student financial aid programs, our clients will need to be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by ED.  Accreditation is a private, non-governmental process for evaluating the quality of educational institutions and their programs in areas including student performance, governance, integrity, educational quality, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and resources, and financial stability.  The HEA requires accrediting commissions recognized by ED to review and monitor many aspects of an institution’s operations and to take appropriate action if the institution fails to meet the accrediting commission’s standards.
 This area is evolving, however, and the scope of services covered by regulations may change.
 State Post-Secondary Education Regulation
 Our clients are authorized to offer education by the relevant state authorizing agencies for the state in which the client is located. For example, GCU, our principal university client, is authorized to offer programs by the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education, the regulatory agency governing private post-secondary educational institutions in the State of Arizona, where it is located. This authorization is very important to our clients and, as a result, to our business. To maintain their state authorization, our clients must continuously meet standards relating to, among other things, educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, marketing and recruitment, financial operations, addition of new locations and educational programs, and various operational and administrative procedures. 

 
  14

 
Our clients’ failure to comply with the requirements of a state regulatory agency could result in our clients’ losing their ability to offer educational programs, which would cause our clients to lose their eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs and could force them, and us, to cease operations. Alternatively, a state regulatory body could restrict our clients’ ability to offer new or certain degree and non-degree programs, which may impair our ability to grow.
 State regulatory requirements for online education have historically varied among the states.  To address this issue and to meet new ED requirements many schools have applied and sought to become an approved institutional participant in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (“SARA”). SARA is an agreement among member states, districts and territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of post-secondary distance education courses and programs. It is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by post-secondary institutions based in another state. SARA is overseen by a national council (NC-SARA) and administered by four regional education compacts, for which Arizona, the state in which our principal client, GCU, is located, is a W-SARA member. There is a yearly renewal for participating in NC-SARA and AZ-SARA and institutions must agree to meet certain requirements to participate. As of June 30, 2018, all states other than California are members of SARA.
 Any state that does not participate in SARA may impose regulatory requirements on out-of-state higher education institutions operating within their boundaries, such as those having a physical facility or conducting certain academic activities within the state. GCU, for example, currently enrolls students in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Although it is currently licensed, authorized, in-process, or exempt in all non-SARA jurisdictions in which it operates, if it fails to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements for a state, or fails to obtain licenses or authorizations when required, it could lose its state license or authorization by that state or be subject to other sanctions, including restrictions on our activities in, and fines and penalties imposed by, that state, as well as fines, penalties, and sanctions imposed by ED. The loss of licensure or authorization in any non-SARA state could prohibit us from recruiting prospective students or offering services to current students in that state, which could significantly affect our business.
 Individual state laws establish standards in areas such as instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and other operational matters. To the extent required with respect to a service category covered by our contractual relationship, we expect to assist our clients in meeting these requirements. Some states limit schools’ ability to offer educational programs and award degrees to residents of those states. Some states also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of ED and may require the posting of surety bonds. While we are not directly subject to those laws, those laws may inhibit our clients from expanding or operating in those states, limiting our ability to serve our clients, which could significantly affect our business.
 State Professional Licensure
 Many states have specific requirements that an individual must satisfy in order to be licensed as a professional in specified fields, including fields such as education and healthcare, and counseling. These requirements vary by state and by field. A student’s success in obtaining licensure following graduation typically depends on several factors, including the background and qualifications of the individual graduate, as well as the following factors, among others:
· | whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure, or by a professional association;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | whether the program from which the student graduated meets all requirements for professional licensure in that state;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | whether the institution and the program are accredited and, if so, by what accrediting commissions; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | whether the institution’s degrees are recognized by other states in which a student may seek to work.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Many states also require that graduates pass a state test or examination as a prerequisite to becoming certified in certain fields, such as teaching and nursing. Many states will certify individuals if they have already been certified in another state.

 Although not directly regulated by these entities, we must be mindful of the requirements placed by state professional licensure bodies on our client institutions to ensure those institutions maintain that licensure.
 Accreditation
 Accreditation is a private, non-governmental process for evaluating the quality of educational institutions and their programs in areas including student performance, governance, integrity, educational quality, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and resources, and financial stability. To be recognized by ED, accrediting commissions must adopt specific standards for their review of educational institutions, conduct peer-review evaluations of institutions, and publicly designate those institutions that meet their criteria. An accredited school is subject to periodic review by its accrediting commissions to determine whether it continues to meet the performance, integrity and quality required for accreditation.
 Our principal client, GCU has been regionally accredited by the HLC and its predecessor since 1968, most recently obtaining reaccreditation in 2017 for the ten-year period through 2027. The HLC is a regional accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education and accredits entire institutions of higher education. Institutional accreditation by a recognized accreditation agency is one of the prerequisites for an institution of higher education to be eligible to disburse Title IV aid to students. In addition, GCU holds a number of programmatic accreditations related to the conduct of specific programs of the college. Other colleges and universities depend, in part, on an institution’s accreditation (institutional, and, in some cases, programmatic) in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Employers rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating candidates’ credentials, and students and corporate and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards.
 Clients other than GCU may be accredited by different accrediting bodies that are likely to have standards that are different from those of the HLC. Moreover, other clients may also hold various programmatic accreditations that set additional requirements related to specific programs. As we work with clients in different regions we will need to work with those accrediting bodies and tailor services to meet the requirements of those accreditors.
 Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs
 To be eligible to participate in the Title IV programs, an institution must comply with specific requirements contained in the HEA and the regulations issued thereunder by ED. An institution must, among other things, be licensed or authorized to offer its educational programs by the state in which it is physically located and maintain institutional accreditation by an accrediting commission recognized by ED.
 The substantial amount of federal funds disbursed to schools through the Title IV programs and the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs have caused Congress to require ED to exercise considerable regulatory oversight over educational institutions. As a result, our clients are subject to extensive oversight and review. Because ED periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations, we cannot predict with certainty how the Title IV program requirements will be applied in all circumstances to our clients or to us directly.
 Significant regulations and other factors relating to the Title IV programs that could adversely affect us include the following:
 Congressional action. Congress must reauthorize the HEA on a periodic basis, usually every five to six years, and the most recent reauthorization occurred in August 2008. The reauthorized HEA reauthorized all of the Title IV programs in which institutions participate but made numerous revisions to the requirements governing the Title IV programs, including provisions relating to student loan default rates and the formula for determining the maximum amount of revenue that institutions are permitted to derive from the Title IV programs. In addition, members of Congress periodically introduce legislation that would impact Title IV programs and the higher education industry generally. Because a significant percentage of our revenue is indirectly derived from the Title IV programs, any action by Congress that significantly reduces Title IV program funding or the ability of our clients to participate in the Title IV programs 

 
  16

 
could reduce the ability of some students to finance their education at our client institutions and materially decrease their student enrollment.
 Regulatory changes. Pursuant to the HEA and following negotiated rulemaking, on November 1, 2016, ED published final regulations that, among other things, would have specified the acts or omissions of an institution that a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a loan made under the Direct Loan Program. Although the regulations were scheduled to become effective on July 1, 2017, on June 16, 2017, ED delayed indefinitely the effective date of selected provisions of the regulations and announced its intention to conduct negotiated rulemaking proceedings to revise the regulations. Those proceedings took place from November 13‑15, 2017; January 8‑11, 2018; and February 12‑15, 2018. These proceedings did not end in consensus and, as such, ED will have the opportunity to write regulations as it sees fit. In addition, on October 24, 2017, ED published an interim final rule to delay until July 1, 2018 the effective date of the selected provisions. On February 14, 2018, ED also published a notice of proposed rulemaking to delay until July 1, 2019 the effective date of the selected provisions.
 The Department has also suggested that it may initiate a new negotiated rulemaking in the future related to various topics. We have no way of knowing the outcome of these regulatory processes or even the full list of topics to be considered. As such, they constitute a potential risk for our clients and, either directly or through our clients, us.
 Eligibility and certification procedures. Each institution must apply periodically to ED for continued certification to participate in the Title IV programs. Such recertification generally is required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change in control. To the extent ED suspends, limits, modifies, conditions, or terminates any client institution’s eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, that action is likely to have a negative impact on our business. Indeed, this could range from disallowing the institution from adding new programs or terminating the institution from Title IV eligibility.
 In August 2017, our principal client, GCU received a new program participation agreement with full certification from ED, which granted the University the ability to participate in the Title IV programs through December 31, 2020. The Transaction resulted in a change in control of GCU, following which it is now operated as a non-profit university and necessitating the application by GCU to ED for approval of the change in control and for a new program participation agreement. ED is currently reviewing GCU’s application for approval of the change in control and GCU is waiting for a new program participation agreement. GCU now participates in the Title IV programs on a provisional, month-to-month basis pending ED’s review and approval of the Transaction.  There can be no assurance that ED will recertify GCU or that it will not impose conditions or other restrictions on GCU as a condition of granting GCU a provisional certification following its change in control.  If ED does not renew or withdraws the certification of GCU to participate in the Title IV programs at any time, its students would no longer be able to receive Title IV program funds.  Similarly, ED could renew GCU’s certification, but restrict or delay its students receipt of Title IV funds, limit the students to whom it could disburse funds, or place other restrictions on the university.  Any of these outcomes would have a material adverse effect on GCU and on us.
 Administrative capability. ED regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite “administrative capability” to participate in the Title IV programs. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution must, among other things:

· | comply with all applicable Title IV program requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | have an adequate number of qualified personnel to administer the Title IV programs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have acceptable standards for measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | not have student loan cohort default rates above specified levels;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have various procedures in place for awarding, disbursing and safeguarding Title IV funds and for maintaining required records;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  17

 


· | administer the Title IV programs with adequate checks and balances in its system of internal controls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | provide financial aid counseling to its students;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | refer to ED’s Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any student, parent, employee, third-party servicer or other agent of the institution has engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving the Title IV programs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submit all required reports and consolidated financial statements in a timely manner; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

  As a service provider, we assist our clients with some facets of these criteria. As such, we must be mindful of, and compliant with, the administrative capability requirements. If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria, ED may:

· | require the institution to repay Title IV funds its students previously received;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | transfer the institution from the advance method of payment of Title IV funds to heightened cash monitoring status or the reimbursement system of payment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | place the institution on provisional certification status; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the institution’s participation in the Title IV programs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Imposition of these sanctions could have a negative impact on our ability to conduct our business.
 Financial responsibility. The HEA and ED regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions must satisfy in order to participate in the Title IV programs. ED evaluates institutions for compliance with these standards on an annual basis based on the institution’s annual audited consolidated financial statements, as well as when the institution applies to ED to have its eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs recertified. The most significant financial responsibility standard is the institution’s composite score, which is derived from a formula established by ED based on three financial ratios:

· | equity ratio, which measures the institution’s capital resources, financial viability and ability to borrow;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | primary reserve ratio, which measures the institution’s ability to support current operations from expendable resources; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | net income ratio, which measures the institution’s ability to operate at a profit or within its means.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ED assigns a strength factor to the results of each of these ratios on a scale from negative 1.0 to positive 3.0, with negative 1.0 reflecting financial weakness and positive 3.0 reflecting financial strength. ED then assigns a weighting percentage to each ratio and adds the weighted scores for the three ratios together to produce a composite score for the institution. The composite score for an institution’s most recent fiscal year must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further ED oversight. In addition to having an acceptable composite score, an institution must, among other things, provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with Title IV program requirements, meet all of its financial obligations, including required refunds to students and any Title IV liabilities and debts, be current in its debt payments, and not receive an adverse, qualified, or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited consolidated financial statements.

 
  18

 

 As a service provider, we are not directly subject to this regulation. However, if ED were to determine that a client institution did not meet the financial responsibility standards due to a failure to meet the composite score or other financial responsibility factors, ED could impose a range of sanctions on the institution, such as requiring the institution to post a letter of credit, accept provisional certification (which would hamper the ability of the institution to add new programs), comply with additional ED monitoring requirements, agree to receive Title IV program funds under an arrangement other than ED’s standard advance funding arrangement, such as the reimbursement system of payment or heightened cash monitoring, and comply with or accept other limitations on the ability to increase the number of programs we offer or the number of students it enrolls, any of which sanctions on our clients could also adversely affect our business.
 Our principal client, GCU, will receive its first composite score following the Transaction with respect to its fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, which score must be provided to ED by March 31, 2020.  At this time, we cannot predict if GCU’s composite score will exceed 1.5 or if ED would impose any sanctions on GCU if its composite score is below 1.5.  If any such sanctions were imposed, it could have a negative impact on our ability to conduct our business.
 Return of Title IV funds for students who withdraw. When a student who has received Title IV program funds withdraws from school, the institution must determine the amount of Title IV program funds the student has “earned” and then must return the unearned Title IV program funds (a “return to Title IV”) to the appropriate lender or ED in a timely manner, which is generally no later than 45 days after the date the institution determined that the student withdrew. If such payments are not timely made, the institution will be required to submit a letter of credit to ED equal to 25% of the Title IV funds that the institution should have returned for withdrawn students in its most recently completed fiscal year. Under ED regulations, the letter of credit requirement is triggered by late returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of the withdrawn students (and involving more than two student refunds) in the audit sample in the institution’s annual Title IV compliance audit for either of the institution’s two most recent fiscal years or in a ED program review. To the extent our services for a client include conducting returns to Title IV, as they do with our principal client, GCU, we would likely be jointly and severally liable to ED, along with the relevant client, for return of those funds.
 Student loan defaults. Under the HEA, an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the Title IV programs if defaults by its students on the repayment of their federal student loans exceed certain levels. For each federal fiscal year, ED calculates a rate of student defaults for each institution (known as a “cohort default rate”). The reauthorization of the HEA in 2008 extended the measurement period for cohort default rates so that the rate is calculated by determining the rate at which borrowers who became subject to their repayment obligation in one federal fiscal year default in that same year or by the end of the second year following the first federal fiscal year (the “three-year method”).
 ED applies legal thresholds to measure an institution’s compliance. If ED notifies an institution that its cohort default rates exceeded 30%, for each of its three most recent federal fiscal years, the institution’s participation in the FDL Program and the Pell grant program would end 30 days after that notification, unless the institution appeals that determination in a timely manner on specified grounds and according to specified procedures. In addition, an institution’s participation in the FDL Program would end 30 days after notification by ED that its most recent cohort default rate, is greater than 40%, unless the institution timely appeals that determination on specified grounds and according to specified procedures. An institution whose participation ends under either of these provisions may not participate in the relevant programs for the remainder of the fiscal year in which the institution receives the notification or for the next two fiscal years. If an institution’s cohort default rate for any single federal fiscal year equals or exceeds 30%, ED may place the institution on provisional certification status.
 While we cannot directly influence a client’s cohort default rates, and do not provide default rate management services, in the course of performing services for a client we would work to assist such client in ensuring that its cohort default rates do not present a compliance risk under this regulation. Nonetheless, if a client institution exceeded the threshold under the three-year method, the sanction imposed could have a negative impact on our ability to conduct our business.  While GCU’s cohort default rates have historically been significantly below these levels, we cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case.

 Incentive compensation rule. An institution that participates in the Title IV programs may not provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment, admissions, or financial aid awarding activity. Prior to July 1, 2011, ED regulations included 12 “safe harbors” that described payments and arrangements that did not violate the incentive compensation rule. Under new rules effective July 1, 2011, the 12 safe harbors were eliminated. Under the revised regulations, each higher education institution agrees that it will not "provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid, to any person or entity who is engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity, or in making decisions regarding the award of Title IV, HEA program funds." Pursuant to this rule, we are prohibited from offering our covered employees, which are those involved with or responsible for recruiting or admissions activities, any bonus or incentive-based compensation based on the successful recruitment, admission or enrollment of students into a postsecondary institution. We are also precluded from offering our covered employees that work on financial aid matters (if any), any bonus or incentive-based compensation based on the award of financial aid to students enrolled in a postsecondary institution.
 In addition, the revised rule initially raised a question as to whether companies like ours, as an entity, are prohibited from entering into tuition revenue-sharing arrangements with university clients. On March 17, 2011, ED issued official agency guidance, known as a "Dear Colleague Letter," or the DCL, providing guidance on this point. The DCL states that "[t]he Department generally views payment based on the amount of tuition generated as an indirect payment of incentive compensation based on success in recruitment and therefore a prohibited basis upon which to measure the value of the services provided" and that "[t]his is true regardless of the manner in which the entity compensates its employees." But the DCL also provides an important exception to the ban on tuition revenue-sharing arrangements between institutions and third parties. According to the DCL, ED does not consider payment based on the amount of tuition generated by an institution to violate the incentive compensation ban if the payment compensates an "unaffiliated third party" that provides a set of "bundled services" that includes recruitment services, such as those we provide. Example 2‑B in the DCL is described as a "possible business model" developed "with the statutory mandate in mind." Example 2‑B describes the following as a possible business model:
 "A third party that is not affiliated with the institution it serves and is not affiliated with any other institution that provides educational services, provides bundled services to the institution including marketing, enrollment application assistance, recruitment services, course support for online delivery of courses, the provision of technology, placement services for internships, and student career counseling. The institution may pay the entity an amount based on tuition generated for the institution by the entity’s activities for all the bundled services that are offered and provided collectively, as long as the entity does not make prohibited compensation payments to its employees, and the institution does not pay the entity separately for student recruitment services provided by the entity."
 The DCL guidance indicates that an arrangement that complies with Example 2‑B will be deemed to be in compliance with the incentive compensation provisions of the HEA and ED’s regulations. Our business model and contractual arrangements with our university clients closely follow Example 2‑B in the DCL. In addition, we assure that none of our "covered employees" is paid any bonus or other incentive compensation in violation of the rule.
 Because the bundled services rule was promulgated in the form of agency guidance issued by ED in the form of a DCL and is not codified by statute or regulation, the rule could be altered or removed without prior notice, public comment period or other administrative procedural requirements that accompany formal agency rulemaking. Similarly, a court could invalidate the rule in an action involving our company or our university clients, or in action that does not involve us at all. The revision, removal or invalidation of the bundled services rule by Congress, ED or a court could require us to change our business model.
 In addition, we have requested guidance from ED that our specific model is proper under the incentive compensation rule and that our company is not an “affiliate” of GCU for purposes of the DCL. We are awaiting a response to this guidance request.

 Compliance reviews. Our client institutions are subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including ED, its Office of Inspector General, state licensing agencies, the applicable state approving agencies for financial assistance to veterans, and accrediting commissions. As part of ED’s ongoing monitoring of institutions’ administration of the Title IV programs, the HEA also requires institutions to annually submit to ED a Title IV compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with applicable federal and ED audit standards. In addition, to enable ED to make a determination of an institution’s financial responsibility, each institution must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with ED regulations.
 As a third-party servicer, not only are our clients subject to reviews and audits that may require our involvement, but we are also subject to program reviews from ED and the Office of the Inspector General. Further, we also have an obligation to annually submit to ED a Title IV compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with applicable federal and ED audit standards.
 Gainful employment rules. Under the HEA, proprietary schools are eligible to participate in Title IV programs in respect of educational programs that lead to “gainful employment in a recognized occupation,” with the limited exception of qualified programs leading to a bachelor’s degree in liberal arts. Historically, this concept has not been defined in detail. In October 2014, ED published final regulations, effective July 1, 2015, on the metrics for determining whether an academic program prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. This rule establishes requirements related to the debt to earnings ratio of graduates of programs at proprietary institutions and one year certificate level programs at non-profit institutions, and sets additional disclosure requirements for students. Under the final regulations, which apply on a program-by-program basis, students enrolled in a program will be eligible for Title IV student financial aid only if that program satisfies at least one of two tests relating to student debt service-to-earnings ratios. The two tests specify minimum debt service-to-earnings ratios calculated on the basis of the earnings of program graduates. One test measures student loan debt service as a percentage of total earnings and is calculated by comparing (1) the annual loan payment required on the median student loan debt incurred by students receiving Title IV funds who completed a particular program and (2) the higher of the mean or median of those graduates’ annual earnings two to four years after graduation. The other test measures student loan debt service as a percentage of discretionary earnings and is calculated by comparing (1) the annual loan payment required on the median student loan debt incurred by students receiving Title IV funds who completed a particular program and (2) the higher of the mean or median annual earnings of those graduates two to four years after graduation, less 1.5 times the government issued Poverty Guideline. Under the currently-in-effect gainful employment regulation, a program would pass if:

· | the annual loan payment required on the median student loan debt is less than or equal to 8% of the higher of the mean or median annual earnings of graduates in the relevant period; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the annual loan payment required on the median student loan debt is less than or equal to 20% of the discretionary income of graduates in the relevant period.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, a program that does not pass either of the debt-to-earnings metrics, and that has an annual earnings rate between 8% and 12%, or a discretionary income rate between 20% and 30%, would be considered to be in the “Zone”. A program would fail if the annual loan payment on the median student loan debt is greater than 12% of the mean or median annual earnings of the graduates or the annual loan payment on the median student debt is greater than 30% of the discretionary income of the graduates. A program would become Title IV-ineligible for three years if it fails both metrics for two out of three consecutive years or is in the Zone (or fails) for four consecutive award years. In the first four years that the debt-to-earnings metrics are calculated under the rule (award years 2014‑15, 2015‑16, 2016‑17, and 2017‑18), if a program would be failing or in the Zone based on the typical approach to calculating debt-to-earnings metrics, transitional debt-to-earnings rates would be calculated using the most currently available yearly earnings two years after graduation and the annual loan payments of students who completed the program in the most recently completed award year. Transitional rates will be used to assess the program if they are lower than what the rates would be under the normal calculation. This allows programs that promptly lower tuition and fees to realize the benefit of their changes.

 If an institution is notified by the Secretary of Education that a program could become ineligible, based on its final rates, for the next award year:

· | The institution must provide a warning with respect to the program to students and prospective students indicating, among other things, that students may not be able to use Title IV funds to attend or continue in the program; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The institution must not enroll, register or enter into a financial commitment with a prospective student until a specified time after providing the warning to the prospective student.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  GCU, our principal client, has historically been considered a proprietary school.  On October 20, 2016, ED issued to institutions, including GCU, draft debt-to-earnings rates for the first gainful employment debt measurement year and certain underlying data used to calculate those rates. According to ED’s draft rates, none of GCU’s programs failed. The draft rates did indicate that four current degree programs were in the Zone, including three undergraduate education programs and the Masters in Theology. 
 Schools are also required to certify to ED the following for each Title IV eligible program:

· | The program is included in the schools’ accreditation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | The program is programmatically accredited, if required by a federal government entity, or by a government entity in any state in which the school is located or is required to obtain state approval;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The program satisfies any applicable state licensing and certification requirements for the occupations for which the program prepares students to enter; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The program is not substantially similar to a program offered by the school that became ineligible due to the student debt service-to-earnings ratios.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  GCU successfully submitted the certifications required for all pre-existing programs prior to the December 31, 2015 deadline for doing so. It continues to follow this protocol on an ongoing basis.
 It is not clear at present whether the degree programs at GCU will need to comply with this regulation or, if so, to what extent. While ED has, in many cases, required institutions that have converted from for-profit to non-profit to comply with this regulation for some limited period, the experience has not been uniform. As such, GCU awaits a resolution of this matter. Depending on the resolution, it may have a negative impact on our ability to conduct our business.
 These regulations went into effect on July 1, 2015, with the exception of the new disclosure requirements that were originally scheduled to go into effect January 1, 2017, but which were delayed, to some extent, until July 1, 2018. ED however announced, on June 16, 2017, its intention to conduct negotiated rulemaking proceedings to revise the gainful employment regulations. Those negotiated rulemaking proceedings began in December 2017 and continued February 5‑8, 2018 and concluded with the session held on March 12‑15, 2018. Although ED published a notice of proposed rulemaking that would eliminate the gainful employment rule, it has not yet published a final rule related to this rule. We are following this rulemaking but do not have a view at this time about how it will affect the business. 
 Substantial misrepresentation. The HEA prohibits an institution that participates in Title IV programs from engaging in “substantial misrepresentation” of the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. ED has defined a misrepresentation as any statement made by the institution or a third party that provides educational programs, marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services to the institution that is false, erroneous or has the likelihood or tendency to deceive. A substantial misrepresentation is any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person’s detriment.

 The regulation also covers statements made by any representative of an institution, including agents, employees and subcontractors, and statements made directly or indirectly to any third party, including state agencies, government officials or the public, and not just to students or prospective students.  Therefore, we are subject to this regulation.
 Considering the breadth of the definition of “substantial misrepresentation,” it is possible that despite our efforts to prevent such misrepresentations, our employees or contractors may make statements that could be construed as substantial misrepresentations for which our clients would be held responsible by ED. We and our employees and subcontractors, as agents of our university clients, must use a high degree of care to comply with such rules and are prohibited by contract from making any false, erroneous or misleading statements about our university clients. To avoid an issue under the misrepresentation rule and similar rules, we assure that all marketing materials are approved in advance by our university clients before they are used by our employees and we carefully monitor our subcontractors.
 Despite our best efforts, we may face complaints from students and prospective students of our clients over statements made by us and our agents throughout the conduct of our services which would expose our clients, and derivatively us, to increased risk of enforcement action and applicable sanctions or other penalties and increased risk of private qui tam actions under the Federal False Claims Act. Also, if ED determines that an institution (including its contractors) has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, ED may revoke an institution’s program participation agreement, impose limitations on the institution’s participation in Title IV programs, deny applications from the institution for approval of new programs or locations or other matters, or initiate proceedings to fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. Similar rules apply under state laws or are incorporated in institutional accreditation standards and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, applies similar rules prohibiting any unfair or deceptive marketing practices to the education sector. If ED or other regulator determines that statements made by us or on our behalf are in violation of the regulations, we could be subject to sanctions and other liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Regulatory Standards that May Restrict Institutional Expansion or Other Changes
 Many actions that our clients may wish to take in connection with expanding their operations or other changes are subject to review or approval by the applicable regulatory agencies. For example, requirements and standards of state post-secondary agencies, accrediting commissions, and ED limit an institution’s ability in certain instances to establish additional teaching locations, implement new educational programs, or increase enrollment in certain programs. Many states require review and approval before institutions can add new locations or programs, and many states limit the number of pre-licensure professional students (such as nursing) colleges may enroll. Similarly, accrediting agencies (institutional and programmatic) generally require institutions to notify them in advance of adding new locations or implementing new programs, and upon notification may undertake a review of the quality of the facility or the program and the financial, academic, and other qualifications of the institution.
 With respect to ED, if an institution participating in the Title IV programs plans to add a new location or educational program, the institution must generally apply to ED to have the additional location or educational program designated as within the scope of the institution’s Title IV eligibility. Institutions that are fully certified to participate in the Title IV programs are not required to obtain ED’s approval of additional programs that lead to a bachelor’s, professional, or graduate degree at the same degree level as programs previously approved by ED, and, similarly, is not required to obtain advance approval for new programs that prepare students for gainful employment in the same or a related recognized occupation as an educational program that has previously been designated by ED as an eligible program at that institution if it meets certain minimum-length requirements.  GCU, because it is currently certified to participate in the Title IV programs on a provisional, month-to-month basis, is required to obtain ED approval for new programs, which requirement could impede GCU’s ability to introduce new programs and slow its growth.
