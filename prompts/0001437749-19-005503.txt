ITEM 1. Business.
General
 
Business First Bancshares, Inc. is a bank holding company headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and the parent company of Business First Bank, a Louisiana state banking association and community-based financial institution that offers a full array of banking products and services. We currently operate throughout the state of Louisiana, including in the state’s seven largest metropolitan markets, and in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex from a network of 25 banking centers.
 
Since our founding in 2006, our mission has not changed – we seek to be the financial institution of choice for our markets’ small-to-midsized businesses and their owners and employees. To achieve this goal, we focus on recruiting, retaining and empowering talented bankers who are intimately familiar with and well respected in the communities that they serve, and on providing market-leading products and services that add value to our customers’ businesses. We are currently one of the ten largest Louisiana-based financial institutions. As of December 31, 2018, on a consolidated basis, we had total assets of $2.1 billion, total loans of $1.5 billion, total deposits of $1.7 billion and shareholders’ equity of $260.0 million.
 
Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “BFST,” with our common stock first trading on the market on April 11, 2018.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
We believe a bank should be measured by the value it adds to its customers’ businesses. We hold that our customers’ needs are best met through local bankers with deep market experience who are empowered with decision-making authority and supported by centralized risk management practices and advanced technology. We understand our competitive strengths and pursue disciplined growth through the careful selection of markets and our position within those markets. Our expansion strategy primarily consists of identifying and recruiting talented teams of bankers in desirable markets and providing them with a platform to better serve their clients.
 
We believe there is an area stretching from Dallas, Texas to Jackson, Mississippi, along the I-20 corridor and from Houston, Texas to Mobile, Alabama, along the I-10/12 corridors whose small-to-midsized businesses and high net worth individuals are underserved relative to other parts of the country and are well suited for our commercial and private banking products and services. We intend to leverage our competitive strengths to take advantage of what we believe are significant growth opportunities both within our existing footprint and in this larger region. Our growth strategy includes:
 

● | Expanding Presence in Existing Markets. While we maintain a strong position in almost all of our markets as one of the top two or three community banks by deposit market share, we are continually working to strengthen our presence in our existing markets. As community bankers, we know that relationships are at the heart of our business, and we are always looking to identify and recruit talented bankers within, as well as outside of, our existing markets. Additionally, we constantly stress deposit growth to our bankers as our ability to grow our loan portfolio within our markets is limited by our ability to fund those loans. Although many of our markets are currently serviced by only one of our banking centers, we may consider adding more banking centers or complementary offices in strategic locations in our markets.

● | Opportunistic Market Expansion. We are well positioned to expand along the I-10/12 and I-20 corridors into the nearby Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, and East Texas markets to the west, and into the Jackson and Gulfport/Biloxi, Mississippi markets to the east. We believe these markets have attractive demographics and a significant concentration of small-to-midsized businesses and high net worth individuals that are historically underserved by the banking industry. We intend to focus on growing into these markets as we identify specific opportunities to recruit talented and entrepreneurial teams of local bankers who fit our culture and banking strategy.

● | Disciplined Acquisition Strategy. While we will remain focused on organic expansion, we will continue to identify and evaluate opportunities for strategic business acquisitions as they arise from time to time. We have historically maintained a disciplined and conservative approach to strategic acquisitions, with our only acquisitions to date being the acquisition of American Gateway Financial Corporation within our home market of Baton Rouge in 2015, the acquisition of Minden Bancorp, Inc. within our second oldest market, Northwest Louisiana, on January 1, 2018, and the acquisition of Richland State Bancorp, Inc. in Northeast Louisiana on November 30, 2018, each of which are described in further detail below. While we anticipate the organic expansion approach will remain our strategic focus going forward and are not currently a party to any formal or informal acquisition arrangements, we will carefully consider acquisition opportunities that we believe are consistent with our strategic vision and provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Activity
 
American Gateway Financial Corporation. On March 31, 2015, we acquired American Gateway Financial Corporation, or AGFC, and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, American Gateway Bank. Prior to the merger, AGFC operated ten full-service banking locations in the Baton Rouge market. We acquired total assets of $371.5 million, total loans of $143.2 million, and total deposits of $283.3 million in the transaction. The acquisition greatly expanded our branch network within the West Baton Rouge and East Baton Rouge markets and enhanced our core deposit portfolio.
Minden Bancorp, Inc. On October 5, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Minden Bancorp, Inc., or MBI, and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, MBL Bank. The acquisition was consummated on January 1, 2018. As a result of the transaction, we acquired MBL Bank’s two full-service banking locations in the Shreveport-Bossier City metropolitan area, total assets of $317.4 million, net loans of $192.7 million, and total deposits of $264.0 million. The acquisition expanded our presence in our Northwest Louisiana market and added what we believe to be a strong portfolio of core deposits to our business.
Richland State Bancorp, Inc. On November 30, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Richland State Bancorp, Inc., or RSBI, and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Richland State Bank. As a result of the transaction, we acquired Richland State Bank’s seven branch locations in Northeast Louisiana, total assets of $316.5 million, net loans of $191.0 million, and total deposits of $290.0 million. The RSBI acquisition furthers our expansion eastward along the I-20 corridor from our historical presence in the Shreveport-Bossier City metropolitan area that began with the acquisition of MBI.
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our peers and position us for future growth:
 

● | Sophisticated Business Lending Capabilities. Unlike traditional community banks, we specifically target business customers with complex needs that require a degree of business lending expertise that is typically found only at larger institutions. We primarily target small-to-midsized businesses with credit needs between $1 million and $10 million, whose banking needs are typically too complex for traditional community banks but are not large enough to attract personalized attention and service from larger institutions. In addition to offering the real estate lending typically available from a community bank, we began focusing heavily on our commercial and industrial products after the economic downturn in 2008 and have developed extensive C&I expertise across our markets. C&I lending requires experienced bankers with a deep understanding of our customers’ businesses and their banking needs, which we believe is well suited for our “high touch” approach to banking. We believe that we have developed an expertise in this small-to-midsized business banking niche that is historically underserved, positioning us for meaningful growth going forward. We have also built treasury and cash management programs that cater to our target customers.

● | True Community Banking Model. Despite being located in Louisiana’s largest metropolitan areas and in the largest metropolitan area in the state of Texas, we have a true community banking mindset. That means relationship-based banking by bankers who live and work in our markets. Our market presidents and their teams are trained in credit underwriting and asset/liability management, as we view them as comprehensive bankers rather than just credit producers. The experience and talent of our market presidents and their respective banking teams allow us to decentralize significant decision-making authority while maintaining disciplined credit practices. In our experience, developing credit underwriting expertise “on the front lines” promotes quality loan generation and maximizes efficiency. Further, our emphasis on asset/liability management training allows our local banking teams to understand the importance of quality core deposit funding, which we believe is vital to our continued loan growth. In this sense, we view Business First Bank as a network of true community banks, not as a typical regional financial institution that makes important credit and strategic decisions at the corporate level without input from its local bankers. In addition, our executive team is located throughout the state of Louisiana, rather than all being in Baton Rouge, providing the bank with a more informed view of our footprint and the best uses of our capital across our footprint
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Entrepreneurial Culture. We have worked hard to build a team of self-starters who are passionate about the business of banking. We have found success recruiting bankers at much larger institutions who are frustrated by excess bureaucracy, overly centralized decision-making, and an escalated focus on the pursuit of larger business banking clients that larger banks perceive as more profitable than the small-to-midsized businesses we target. Likewise, we have successfully recruited bankers at peer or smaller institutions that do not have the available resources or operating platform to appropriately serve the more sophisticated banking needs of the small-to-midsized businesses in our markets. Our executive team is young and energetic. We believe their collaborative and cohesive approach to working relationships permeates every level of our organization, creating synergies that leave us well-positioned for future growth and helps us attract and retain other talented and entrepreneurial bankers as members of our team.

● | History of Disciplined Expansion. Since our founding in 2006, we have grown rapidly across the state of Louisiana and into Dallas. Each of our expansions were initiated with careful identification and recruitment of local banking teams and thoughtful consideration of each market’s different industries and credit exposures. Our banking centers are carefully situated in locations, typically downtowns and suburban centers, optimized for small-to-midsized business customers and high net worth individuals. This disciplined approach to expansion and growth entails not only recruiting the right bankers in the right markets, but in continuing to focus on the customer base that we are optimized to serve rather than chasing larger relationships as we grow. Over the years, the magnitude of our large banking relationships has changed very little, but the number of our large relationships has grown significantly. In order to continue to serve our customers as they grow without taking undue risk, we have developed a strong participation network that we believe underscores the strength of our underwriting process and the quality of our portfolio. We believe that it is important to keep sight of where our strengths lie and not pursue growth blindly.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong Platform for Growth. As a necessary complement to our style of sophisticated community banking, we have made significant investments to build a strong operational platform to empower our individual markets to thrive, to create operational efficiencies across our diverse markets, and to position us for future growth without commensurate growth in operational expenses. We have invested heavily in risk management personnel and modeling capabilities in recent years – we believe our underwriting capabilities are second to none in our markets, and our strong participation network and asset quality metrics are evidence of those capabilities. We have also invested heavily in technology since hiring Keith Mansfield in 2015, which we believe will allow us to maintain staffing that is skewed towards the production side of our business and to accommodate future growth without commensurate increases in operating expenses. We believe our investments in technology will also allow us to maintain our “high tech/high touch” approach without the need for an extensive network of brick and mortar locations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Markets
 
Our banking operations are currently organized into ten markets in Louisiana, which include the seven largest metropolitan areas in the state, and the Dallas, Texas market, which we service through 25 banking centers. While we do not have any further specific expansion plans at this time, we will continue to look for talented teams of bankers in markets and potential acquisitions that fit our model going forward.
Our Products and Services
 
Business First Bank is an independent financial institution that is engaged in substantially all of the business operations customarily conducted by financial institutions in Louisiana and Texas. We offer, among other products, checking, savings and money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial and consumer loans, mortgage loans, real estate loans, and other installment and term loans. In addition, Business First Bank offers our customers wealth management products, drive-through banking facilities, automated teller machines, night depository, personalized checks, credit cards, debit cards, internet banking, electronic funds transfers through ACH services, domestic and foreign wire transfers, traveler’s checks, cash management, vault services, loan and deposit sweep accounts, and lock box services.
Lending Activities
 
As a business-focused community-based financial institution, we offer a variety of business-related loans, including commercial lines of credit, working capital loans, commercial real estate-backed loans (including loans secured by owner occupied commercial properties), term loans, equipment financing, acquisition, expansion and development loans, borrowing base loans, real estate construction loans, homebuilder loans, letters of credit and other loan products to small-to-midsized businesses, real estate developers, mortgage lenders, manufacturing and industrial companies and other businesses. We also offer various consumer loans to individuals and professionals including residential real estate loans, home equity loans, installment loans, unsecured and secured personal lines of credit, and standby letters of credit. Lending activities originate from the efforts of our bankers, with an emphasis on lending to small-to-midsized businesses, their owners and employees, and high net worth individuals located in our market areas. Although all lending involves a degree of risk, we work to mitigate these risks through conservative underwriting policies and consistent monitoring of credit quality indicators.

Commercial and Industrial Loans. We make general C&I loans, including commercial lines of credit, working capital loans, term loans, equipment financing, asset acquisition, expansion and development loans, borrowing base loans, letters of credit and other loan products, primarily in our target markets that are underwritten on the basis of the borrower’s ability to service the debt from income. We typically take as collateral a lien on general business assets including, among other things, available real estate, accounts receivable, promissory notes, inventory and equipment and generally obtain a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. Our C&I loans generally have variable interest rates and terms that typically range from one-to-five years depending on factors such as the type and size of the loan, the financial strength of the borrower/guarantor and the age, type and value of the collateral. Fixed rate C&I loan maturities are generally short-term, with one-to-five year maturities, or include periodic interest rate resets. Our underwriting policy does allow for exceptions in which the term and amortization of a C&I loan may be longer than five years, however, the term and amortization must be consistent with the useful life and depreciation rates of the underlying collateral and an underwriting exception will be noted. In general, C&I loans may involve increased credit risk and, therefore, typically yield a higher return than commercial real estate loans. The increased risk in C&I loans derives from the expectation that such loans generally are serviced principally from the operations of the business, and those operations may not be successful. Any interruption or discontinuance of operating cash flows from the business, which may be influenced by events not under the control of the borrower such as economic events and changes in governmental regulations, could materially affect the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. In addition, the collateral securing C&I loans generally includes moveable property such as equipment and inventory, which may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipated, exposing us to increased credit risk. As a result of these additional complexities, variables and risks, C&I loans require extensive underwriting and servicing.
Construction and Development Loans. Our construction portfolio includes loans to small-to-midsized businesses to construct owner-user properties, loans to developers of commercial real estate investment properties and residential developments and, to a lesser extent, loans to individual clients for construction of single family homes in our market areas. Construction and development loans are generally made with a term of one-to-two years with interest paid monthly. Our underwriting policy does allow for exceptions in which the term of a construction and development loan may be longer than two years; however, the term must be realistic and consistent with the borrower’s documented ability to repay. The ratio of the loan principal to the value of the collateral, as established by independent appraisal, typically will not exceed regulatory supervisory guidelines. Loan proceeds are disbursed based on the percentage of completion and only after the project has been inspected by an experienced construction lender or third-party inspector. Risks associated with construction and development loans include fluctuations in the value of real estate, project completion risk and change in market trends. We are also exposed to risk based on the ability of the construction loan borrower to finance the loan or sell the property upon completion of the project, which may be affected by changes in secondary market terms and criteria for permanent financing since the time that we funded the loan.
Commercial Real Estate Loans. We offer real estate loans for commercial property that is owner-occupied as well as commercial property owned by real estate investors. Commercial loans that are secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate and primarily collateralized by operating cash flows are also included in this category of loan. Commercial real estate loan terms are generally five years or less and amortization is generally limited to 20 years or less, although payments may be structured on a longer amortization basis in unusual cases. The interest rates on our commercial real estate loans may be fixed or adjustable, although rates typically are not fixed for a period exceeding five years. We generally charge an origination fee for our services. We typically require personal guarantees from the principal owners of the business supported by a review of the principal owners’ personal financial statements and global debt service obligations. Risks associated with commercial real estate loans include fluctuations in the value of real estate, the overall strength of the economy, new job creation trends, tenant vacancy rates, environmental contamination and the quality of the borrower’s management. We make efforts to limit our risk by analyzing borrowers’ cash flow and collateral value. The real estate securing our existing commercial real estate loans includes a wide variety of property types, such as owner-occupied offices/warehouses/production facilities, office buildings, hotels, mixed-use residential/commercial properties, retail centers and multifamily properties. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio presents a higher risk profile than our consumer real estate and consumer loan portfolios.
Residential Real Estate Loans. We offer first and second lien one-to-four family mortgage loans, as well as home equity lines of credit, in each case primarily on owner-occupied primary residences. Our retail consumer real estate lending products are offered primarily to consumer customers within our geographic markets. We also originate for resale one-to-four family mortgage loans, and those loans are included as a part of our consumer real estate loan portfolio until sold to investors. Although our consumer real estate loan portfolio presents lower levels of risk than our commercial, commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios, we are exposed to risk based on fluctuations in the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan, as well as changes in the borrower’s financial condition, which could be affected by numerous factors, including divorce, job loss, illness or other personal hardship.
Consumer Loans. While our focus is on service to small-to-midsized businesses, we also make a variety of loans to individuals for personal, family and household purposes, including secured and unsecured installment and term loans. We offer consumer loans as an accommodation to our existing customers and do not market consumer loans to persons who do not have a pre-existing relationship with us. Our consumer loans, which are underwritten primarily based on the borrower’s financial condition and, in some cases, are unsecured credits, subject us to risk based on changes in the borrower’s financial condition, which could be affected by numerous factors, including divorce, job loss, illness or other personal hardship, and fluctuations in the value of the real estate or personal property securing the consumer loan, if any.

Credit Policies and Procedures
 
General. We adhere to what we believe are disciplined underwriting standards, but also remain cognizant of the need to serve the credit needs of customers in our primary market areas by offering flexible loan solutions in a responsive and timely manner. We maintain asset quality through an emphasis on local market knowledge, long-term customer relationships, consistent and thorough underwriting for all loans and a conservative credit culture. We also seek to maintain a broadly diversified loan portfolio across customer, product and industry types. Our lending policies do not provide for any loans that are highly speculative, subprime, or that have high loan-to-value ratios. These components, together with active credit management, are the foundation of our credit culture, which we believe is critical to enhancing the long-term value of our organization to our customers, employees, shareholders and communities.
Credit Concentrations. In connection with the management of our credit portfolio, we actively manage the composition of our loan portfolio, including credit concentrations. Our loan approval policies establish concentrations limits with respect to industry and loan product type to enhance portfolio diversification. In general, loan product concentration levels, our commercial real estate concentrations, and industry concentration levels are monitored monthly and reviewed by the Bank’s Board of Directors.
Loan Approval Process.  We seek to achieve an appropriate balance between prudent, disciplined underwriting and flexibility in our decision-making and responsiveness to our customers. Our board has established an “in-house” lending limit to any single customer equal to 15% of the Bank’s Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital in the case of loans that are not fully secured, with an additional 10% of the Bank’s Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral having a market value, as determined by reliable and continuously available price quotations at least equal to the amount of the loan. The capital calculation will be as of the prior month end. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had a legal lending limit of approximately $111.5 million for loans secured without readily marketable collateral, and its “in-house” lending limit was $33.5 million as of such date. Our credit underwriters are based throughout our footprint and service all of our markets from those locations.
 
Our credit approval policies provide for various levels of officer, senior management and the board of directors lending authority for both consumer and commercial credits. We have consumer, matrix and committee approval structures. All commercial loans (except cash secured) require a minimum of two approvers. Consumer loans are approved on a transactional basis by consumer lending personnel using credit underwriting software which recommends approval or declines approval based on policy guidelines. Consumer loans with exceptions must be approved by senior management or a loan committee with override authority. These parameters are reviewed by management and the board of directors, periodically, to ensure proper underwriting and scalability.
 
Credit Risk Management.  Credit risk management involves a partnership between our executive team and our market presidents. Loan officers, credit administration personnel and senior management proactively support collection activities. Our evaluation and compensation program for our loan officers includes significant goals, such as the percentages of past due loans and charge-offs to total loans in the officer’s portfolio, that we believe motivate the loan officers to focus on the origination and maintenance of high-quality credits consistent with our strategic focus on asset quality. Our policies require rapid notification of delinquency and prompt initiation of collection actions.
 
 7


We maintain a list of loans, or the Watch List that receive additional attention if we believe there may be a potential credit risk.  The Watch List is presented to the Board of Directors monthly.  Loan officers are encouraged to bring potential credit issues to the attention of credit administration personnel, and loan grades are updated as deemed appropriate.  Additionally, we periodically have an independent, third-party review performed on our loan portfolio.  This review includes analysis of the borrower’s and guarantor’s financial condition, the Bank’s collateral position, and other credit risk factors.  Results of the review as well as management responses are presented to the Bank’s Risk Committee.  Finally, we perform stress testing on key segments of our portfolio in which we evaluate the impact of declining economic conditions on the portfolio based on previous recessionary periods.  The reporting and reviews provide management with additional information for assessing our asset quality.
 
Deposits
 
Our deposits serve as the primary funding source for lending, investing and other general banking purposes. We offer business accounts and cash management services, including business checking and savings accounts and treasury management services. We also provide a full range of deposit products and services, including a variety of checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, debit cards, remote deposit capture, online banking, mobile banking, e-Statements, bank-by-mail and direct deposit services. We solicit deposits through our relationship-driven team of dedicated and accessible bankers and through community-focused marketing and have recently implemented an incentive bonus program with our bankers to encourage deposit growth. We also seek to cross-sell deposit products at loan origination.
 
Given the diverse nature of our banking location network and our relationship-driven approach to our customers, we believe our deposit base is comparatively less sensitive to interest rate variations than our competitors. Nevertheless, we attempt to competitively price our deposit products to promote core deposit growth. As a business-focused bank offering comprehensive business banking services, we encourage our customers to bank their deposits with us and believe that the quality of our lending relationships and personalized service helps us in these efforts.
 
Wealth Solutions Services
 
We offer wealth management and other fiduciary and private banking services targeted to high net worth individuals, including professionals, business owners, families and professional service companies. In addition to fiduciary and investment management fee income, we believe these services enable us to build new relationships and expand existing relationships to grow our deposits and loans. Through our wealth management line of business, we offer financial planning, retirement services and trust and investment management by a team of seasoned advisors providing access to a wide range of certificates of deposits, mutual funds, annuities, individual retirement accounts, money market accounts and other financial products. Our private banking products and services are offered at all of our banking centers.
Other Products and Services
 
In addition to traditional banking activities and the other products and services specified above, we provide a broad array of financial services to our customers, including debit and credit card products, treasury and cash management services, merchant services, employee and payroll benefits solutions (including payroll cards and bank-at-work benefits) automated clearing house services, lock-box services remote deposit capture services, international trade finance, international trade services, foreign exchange services, and other treasury services.
Subsidiaries
 
We have two wholly-owned subsidiaries. Business First Bank is a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Business First Bancshares, Inc. Business First Insurance, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Business First Bank, and is, therefore, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Business First Insurance, LLC is currently inactive and does not engage in any material business activities.

Competition
 
The banking and financial services industry is highly competitive, and we compete with a wide range of financial institutions within our markets, including local, regional and national commercial banks and credit unions. We also compete with mortgage companies, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, mutual funds, securities firms, insurance companies, third-party payment processors, fintech companies and other financial intermediaries for certain of our products and services. Some of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions and level of regulatory supervision applicable to us.
 
Interest rates on loans and deposits, as well as prices on fee-based services, are typically significant competitive factors within banking and financial services industry. Many of our competitors are much larger financial institutions that have greater financial resources than we do and compete aggressively for market share. These competitors attempt to gain market share through their financial product mix, pricing strategies and banking center locations. Other important competitive factors in our industry and markets include office locations and hours, quality of customer service, community reputation, continuity of personnel and services, capacity and willingness to extend credit, and ability to offer sophisticated banking products and services. While we seek to remain competitive with respect to fees charged, interest rates and pricing, we believe that our broad and sophisticated commercial banking product suite, our high-quality customer service culture, and our positive reputation and community relationships will enable us to compete successfully within our markets and enhance our ability to attract and retain customers.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 333 full-time equivalent employees. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or are parties to a collective bargaining unit. We are committed to hiring and retaining high quality employees to execute our strategic plan, and we believe our relations with our employees are good.

Supervision and Regulation
 
General
 
The U.S. banking industry is highly regulated under federal and state law. Consequently, our growth and earnings performance will be affected not only by management decisions and general and local economic conditions, but also by the statutes administered by, and the regulations and policies of, various governmental regulatory authorities. These authorities include the Federal Reserve, FDIC, CFPB, Louisiana OFI, IRS and state taxing authorities. The effect of these statutes, regulations and policies, and any changes to such statutes, regulations and policies, can be significant and cannot be predicted.
 
The primary goals of the bank regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system, facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy and promote fairness and transparency for financial products and services. The system of supervision and regulation applicable to us and our subsidiaries establishes a comprehensive framework for their respective operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, the Bank’s depositors and the public, rather than our shareholders or creditors. The description below summarizes certain elements of the applicable bank regulatory framework. This description is not intended to describe all laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries, and the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations, policies, interpretive letters and other written guidance that are described herein.
 
Business First Bancshares, Inc. 
 
As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, or the BHCA, and to supervision, examination and enforcement by the Federal Reserve. The BHCA and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve’s jurisdiction also extends to any company that we directly or indirectly control, such as any nonbank subsidiaries and other companies in which we own a controlling investment.
Financial Services Industry Reform. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act broadly affects the financial services industry by implementing changes to the financial regulatory landscape aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector, including provisions that, among other things:

● | establish the CFPB, an independent organization within the Federal Reserve dedicated to promulgating and enforcing consumer protection laws applicable to all entities offering consumer financial products or services;

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect publicly-traded companies. However, under the JOBS Act there are certain exceptions to these requirements for so long as a publicly-traded qualifies as an emerging growth company.
 
The requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act are still in the process of being implemented over time and most will be subject to regulations implemented over the course of several years. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations is unclear. Further, the Trump administration has indicated that it desires to overhaul certain provisions of Dodd-Frank, and the proposed Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act being considered by Congress would change many provisions of Dodd-Frank as well. Changes resulting from further implementation of, changes to, or repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
 

Revised Rules on Regulatory Capital. Regulatory capital rules pursuant to the Basel III requirements, released in July 2013 and effective January 1, 2015, implement higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. These rules include a new common equity Tier 1, or CET1, capital requirement and establish criteria that instruments must meet to be considered common equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital or Tier 2 capital. These enhancements are designed to both improve the quality and increase the quantity of capital required to be held by banking organizations, better equipping the U.S. banking system to cope with adverse economic conditions. The revised capital rules require banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-based assets, a total Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-based assets, a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-based assets and a leverage ratio of 4.0% of average assets.
 
 11


The capital rules also require banks to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a total Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, a total capital ratio of 10.0% and a leverage ratio of 5.0% to be deemed “well capitalized” for purposes of certain rules and prompt corrective action requirements. The risk-based ratios include a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above its minimum risk-based capital requirements that must be composed of common equity Tier 1 capital. This buffer will help to ensure that banking organizations conserve capital when it is most needed, allowing them to better weather periods of economic stress. The buffer is measured relative to risk-weighted assets. The capital conservation buffer began phasing in in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. Although these new capital ratios did not become fully phased in until 2019, the banking regulators generally expected bank holding companies and banks to meet these requirements well ahead of that date. An institution would be subject to limitations on certain activities including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if its capital level is below the buffered ratio. As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s capital met or exceeded these capital requirements on a fully phased-in basis.
 
The new capital rules also attempt to improve the quality of capital by implementing changes to the definition of capital. Among the most important changes are stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments that would disallow the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities (other than grandfathered trust preferred securities such as those issued by the Company), in Tier 1 capital going forward and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the new rule requires that most regulatory capital deductions be made from CET1 capital.
 
The Federal Reserve may also set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. Bank regulatory agencies could also impose higher capital requirements to meet well-capitalized standards and future regulatory change could impose higher capital standards as a routine matter. As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s regulatory capital ratios and those of the Bank were in excess of the levels established for “well-capitalized” institutions under the rules.
 
These rules also set forth certain changes in the methods of calculating certain risk-weighted assets, which in turn will affect the calculation of risk based ratios. Under the new rules, higher or more sensitive risk weights have been assigned to various categories of assets, including, certain credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credits that are 90 days past due or on non-accrual status, foreign exposures and certain corporate exposures. In addition, these rules include greater recognition of collateral and guarantees, and revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions.
 
On November 21, 2018, federal regulators released a proposed rulemaking that would, if enacted, provide certain banks and their holding companies with the option to elect out of complying with the Basel III Capital Rules. Under the proposal, a qualifying community banking organization would be eligible to elect the community bank leverage ratio framework if it has a community bank leverage ratio, or CBLR, greater than 9% at the time of election.
 
A qualifying community banking organization, or QCBO, is defined as a bank, a savings association, a bank holding company or a savings and loan holding company with:
 

● | total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | total off-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives other than credit derivatives and unconditionally cancelable commitments) of 25% or less of total consolidated assets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | MSAs of 25% or less of CBLR tangible equity; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | temporary difference DTAs of 25% or less of CBLR tangible equity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 12


Under the proposed rules, a QCBO may elect out of complying with the Basel III Capital Rules if, at the time of the election, the QCBO has a CBLR above 9%. The numerator of the CBLR is referred to as ‘‘CBLR tangible equity’’ and is calculated as the QCBO’s total capital as reported in compliance with Call Report and FR Y-9C instructions, or Reporting Instructions (prior to including non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries) less:
 

● | Accumulated other comprehensive income (referred to in the industry as AOCI);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Intangible assets, calculated in accordance with Reporting Instructions, other than mortgage servicing assets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards net of any related valuations allowances.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The denominator of the CBLR is the QCBO’s average assets, calculated in accordance with Reporting Instructions and less intangible assets and deferred tax assets deducted from CBLR tangible equity. The Company will continue to monitor this rulemaking. If and when the rulemaking goes into effect, the Company and the Bank will consider whether it would be possible and advantageous at that time to elect to comply with the community bank leverage ratio framework.
 
Imposition of Liability for Undercapitalized Subsidiaries. Bank regulators are required to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions whose capital declines below certain levels. In the event an institution becomes undercapitalized, it must submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary’s compliance with the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy.
 
The aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank is limited to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to cause the institution to be adequately capitalized. The bank regulators have greater power in situations where an institution becomes significantly or critically undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. For example, a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior Federal Reserve approval of proposed dividends, or might be required to consent to a consolidation or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates.
 
Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies. The BHCA, requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before it acquires all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or bank holding company if after such acquisition it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5.0% of the voting shares of such bank or bank holding company. In approving bank or bank holding company acquisitions by bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve is required to consider, among other things, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the financial condition, managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the record of performance under the CRA), the effectiveness of the applicant in combating money laundering activities and the extent to which the proposed acquisition would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. Our ability to make future acquisitions will depend on our ability to obtain approval for such acquisitions from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve could deny our application based on the above criteria or other considerations. For example, we could be required to sell banking centers as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefit of a proposed acquisition.
Control Acquisitions. Federal and state laws, including the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, or CBCA, impose additional prior notice or approval requirements and ongoing regulatory requirements on any investor that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution or bank holding company. Whether an investor “controls” a depository institution is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment. As a general matter, an investor is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 25.0% or more of any class of voting securities. Subject to rebuttal, an investor is presumed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 10.0% or more of any class of voting securities and either the depository institution or company is a public company or no other person will hold a greater percentage of that class of voting securities after the acquisition. If an investor’s ownership of our voting securities were to exceed certain thresholds, the investor could be deemed to “control” us for regulatory purposes, which could subject such investor to regulatory filings or other regulatory consequences. The requirements of the BHCA and the CBCA could limit our access to capital and could limit parties who could acquire shares of our common stock.

Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends; Source of Strength. As a bank holding company, we are subject to certain restrictions on dividends under applicable banking laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve has issued a supervisory letter that provides that a bank holding company should not pay dividends unless: (1) its net income over the last four quarters (net of dividends paid) has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries; and (3) the bank holding company will continue to meet minimum required capital adequacy ratios. Failure to comply with the supervisory letter could result in a supervisory finding that the bank holding company is operating in an unsafe and unsound manner. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may also be limited as a result of the capital conservation buffer under the Basel III regulatory capital framework. In the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. The Federal Reserve may further restrict the payment of dividends by engaging in supervisory action to restrict dividends or by requiring us to maintain a higher level of capital than would otherwise be required under the Basel III minimum capital requirements.
 
Under longstanding Federal Reserve policy which has been codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, we are expected to act as a source of financial strength to, and to commit resources to support, the Bank. This support may be required at times when we may not be inclined to provide it. In addition, any capital loans that we make to the Bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the Bank. As discussed above, in certain circumstances, we could also be required to guarantee the capital restoration plan of the Bank, if it became undercapitalized for purposes of the Federal Reserve’s prompt corrective action regulations. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank under a capital restoration plan would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
 
In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the trustee will be deemed to have assumed and will be required to cure immediately any deficit under any commitment by the debtor holding company to any of the federal banking agencies to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution, and any claim for breach of such obligation will generally have priority over most other unsecured claims.
 
Scope of Permissible Activities. Under the BHCA, we are prohibited from acquiring a direct or indirect interest in or control of more than 5.0% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or financial holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiary banks, except that we may engage in, directly or indirectly, and may own shares of companies engaged in certain activities found by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. These activities include, among others, operating a mortgage, finance, credit card or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing investment and financial advice; acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing personal property on a full-payout, nonoperating basis; and providing certain stock brokerage and investment advisory services. In approving acquisitions or the addition of activities, the Federal Reserve considers, among other things, whether the acquisition or the additional activities can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh such possible adverse effects as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices.
 
 14


Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, effective March 11, 2000, or the GLB Act, amended the BHCA and eliminated the barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurance companies and other financial service providers. The GLB Act permits bank holding companies to become financial holding companies and thereby affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature. The GLB Act defines “financial in nature” to include, among other things, securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. No regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve. We currently have no plans to make a financial holding company election, although we may make a financial holding company election in the future if we engage in any lines of business that are impermissible for bank holding companies but permissible for financial holding companies.
 
Safe and Sound Banking Practices. Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y, for example, generally requires a bank holding company to provide the Federal Reserve with prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10.0% or more of the bank holding company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. In certain circumstances, the Federal Reserve could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.
 
The Federal Reserve has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices, result in breaches of fiduciary duty or which constitute violations of laws or regulations, and can assess civil money penalties or impose enforcement action for such activities. The penalties can be as high as $1,000,000 for each day the activity continues.
 
Anti-tying Restrictions. Bank holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extensions of credit, to other nonbanking services offered by a bank holding company or its affiliates.
Business First Bank 
 
The Bank is a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the State of Louisiana. In addition, its deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent permitted by law. As a result, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions and the FDIC. Finally, we are also subject to secondary oversight by state banking authorities in other states in which we may maintain banking offices. The bank regulatory agencies have the power to enforce compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations. These requirements and restrictions include requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon and restrictions relating to investments and other activities of the Bank.
Capital Adequacy Requirements. The FDIC and Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions monitor the capital adequacy of the Bank by using a combination of risk-based guidelines and leverage ratios similar to those applied at the holding company level. These agencies consider the bank’s capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to the safety and soundness of the bank and the banking system. Under the revised capital rules which became effective on January 1, 2015, the Bank is required to maintain four minimum capital standards: (1) a leverage capital ratio of at least 4.0%, (2) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%, (3) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0%, and (4) a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%.
 
The Basel III framework also implements a requirement for all FDIC-insured banks to maintain a capital conservation buffer above the minimum capital requirements to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer must be composed solely of common equity Tier 1 capital. The capital conservation buffer requirement effectively requires banking organizations to maintain regulatory risk-based capital ratios at least 2.5% above the minimum risk-based capital requirements set forth above. 
 
 15


These capital requirements are minimum requirements. The FDIC or Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions may also set higher capital requirements if warranted by the risk profile of the Bank, economic conditions impacting its markets or other circumstances particular to the bank. For example, FDIC guidance provides that higher capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk and the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. In addition, the FDIC’s prompt corrective action regulations discussed below, in effect, increase the minimum regulatory capital ratios for banking organizations. Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the Bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, restrictions on business activities and other measures under the FDIC’s prompt corrective action regulations.
 
On November 21, 2018, federal regulators released a proposed rulemaking that would, if enacted, provide certain banks and their holding companies with the option to elect out of complying with the Basel III Capital Rules. These proposed rules are discussed above in “—Business First Bancshares, Inc.—Revised Rules on Regulatory Capital.”
 
Corrective Measures for Capital Deficiencies. The federal banking regulators are required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or FDI Act, to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to capital-deficient institutions that are FDIC-insured. For this purpose, a financial institution is placed in one of the following five capital tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” The institution’s capital tier depends upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation.
 
To be well capitalized, a financial institution must have a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, and a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive requiring it to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank met the requirements to be categorized as well capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework currently in effect.
 
Banks that are adequately, but not well, capitalized may not accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits except with a waiver from the Federal Reserve and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on its deposits. The FDIC’s prompt corrective action regulations also generally prohibit a bank from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the bank would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized institutions are also subject to growth limitations, may not accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The agencies may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the bank’s capital. Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the FDIC must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. The capital classification of a bank also affects the frequency of regulatory examinations, the bank’s ability to engage in certain activities and the deposit insurance premiums paid by the bank.
 
Branching. Under Louisiana law, the Bank is permitted to establish additional branch offices within Louisiana, subject to the approval of the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bank may also establish additional branch offices outside of Louisiana, subject to prior regulatory approval, so long as the laws of the state where the branch is to be located would permit a state bank chartered in that state to establish a branch. Any new branch, whether located inside or outside of Louisiana, must also be approved by the FDIC, as the Bank’s primary federal regulator. The Bank may also establish offices in other states by merging with banks or by purchasing branches of other banks in other states, subject to certain restrictions.
 
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Transactions between the Bank and its nonbanking subsidiaries and/or affiliates, including us, are subject to Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W. In general, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act imposes limits on the amount of such transactions, and also requires certain levels of collateral for loans to affiliated parties. It also limits the amount of advances to third parties which are collateralized by the securities or obligations of the Company or its subsidiaries. Covered transactions with any single affiliate may not exceed 10.0% of the capital stock and surplus of the Bank, and covered transactions with all affiliates may not exceed, in the aggregate, 20.0% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. For a bank, capital stock and surplus refers to the bank’s Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, as calculated under the risk-based capital guidelines, plus the balance of the allowance for credit losses excluded from Tier 2 capital. The Bank’s transactions with all of its affiliates in the aggregate are limited to 20.0% of the foregoing capital. “Covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. In addition, in connection with covered transactions that are extensions of credit, the Bank may be required to hold collateral to provide added security to the Bank, and the types of permissible collateral may be limited. The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of what types of transactions are covered transactions to include credit exposures related to derivatives, repurchase agreement and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be satisfied.
 
 16


Affiliate transactions are also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which generally requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated persons. The Federal Reserve has also issued Regulation W which codifies prior regulations under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and interpretive guidance with respect to affiliate transactions.
 
The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal shareholders and their related interests (collectively referred to herein as “insiders”) contained in Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and in Regulation O promulgated by the Federal Reserve apply to all insured institutions and their subsidiaries and bank holding companies. These restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests. Generally, the aggregate of these loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus, although a bank’s regulators may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate. Loans to senior executive officers of a bank are even further restricted. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions.
 
Restrictions on Distribution of Bank Dividends and Assets. The Bank is subject to certain restrictions on dividends under federal and state laws, regulations and policies. In general, the Bank may pay dividends to us without the approval of the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions so long as the amount of the dividend does not exceed the Bank’s net profits earned during the current year combined with its retained net profits of the immediately preceding year. The Bank is required to obtain the approval of the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions for any amount in excess of this threshold. In addition, under federal law, the Bank may not pay any dividend to us if it is undercapitalized or the payment of the dividend would cause it to become undercapitalized. The FDIC may further restrict the payment of dividends by engaging in supervisory action to restrict dividends or by requiring the bank to maintain a higher level of capital than would otherwise be required to be adequately capitalized for regulatory purposes. Under the Basel III regulatory capital framework, the failure to maintain an adequate capital conservation buffer, as discussed above, may also result in dividend restrictions. Moreover, if, in the opinion of the FDIC, the Bank is engaged in an unsound practice (which could include the payment of dividends), the FDIC may require, generally after notice and hearing, the bank to cease such practice. The FDIC has indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe banking practice. The FDIC has also issued policy statements providing that insured depository institutions generally should pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.
 
Further, in the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of the institution to its shareholders, including any depository institution holding company (such as us) or any shareholder or creditor thereof.

Incentive Compensation Guidance. The federal banking agencies have issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of those organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The incentive compensation guidance sets expectations for banking organizations concerning their incentive compensation arrangements and related risk-management, control and governance processes. The incentive compensation guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon three primary principles: (1) balanced risk-taking incentives, (2) compatibility with effective controls and risk management and (3) strong corporate governance. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or take other actions. In addition, under the incentive compensation guidance, a banking organization’s federal supervisor may initiate enforcement action if the organization’s incentive compensation arrangements pose a risk to the safety and soundness of the organization. Further, a provision of the Basel III capital standards described above would limit discretionary bonus payments to bank executives if the institution’s regulatory capital ratios fail to exceed certain thresholds. A number of federal regulatory agencies proposed rules that would require enhanced disclosure of incentive-based compensation arrangements initially in April 2011, and again in April and May 2016, but the rules have not been finalized and would mostly apply to banking organizations with over $50 billion in total assets. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future.
Audit Reports.   For insured institutions with total assets of $1.0 billion or more, financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, management’s certifications signed by our and the Bank’s chief executive officer and chief accounting or financial officer concerning management’s responsibility for the financial statements, and an attestation by the auditors regarding the Bank’s internal controls must be submitted. For institutions with total assets of more than $3.0 billion, independent auditors may be required to review quarterly financial statements. FDICIA requires that the Bank have an independent audit committee, consisting of outside directors only, or that we have an audit committee that is entirely independent. The committees of such institutions must include members with experience in banking or financial management, must have access to outside counsel and must not include representatives of large customers. The Bank’s audit committee consists entirely of independent directors.
Deposit Insurance Assessments. The FDIC insures the deposits of federally insured banks up to prescribed statutory limits for each depositor through the Deposit Insurance Fund and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and thrift industries. The maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks and savings institutions is $250,000 per depositor. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each insured depository institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors and is calculated based on an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity.
 
We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the Deposit Insurance Fund and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking, if required. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the FDIC otherwise determines to increase assessment rates, the Bank may be required to pay higher FDIC insurance premiums. Any future increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material and adverse effect on our earnings.
 
In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Deposit Insurance Fund. These assessments, which are included in Deposit Insurance Premiums on the Consolidated Statements of Income, will continue until the FICO bonds mature between 2017 and 2019.
 
Financial Modernization. Under the GLB Act, banks may establish financial subsidiaries and engage, subject to limitations on investment, in activities that are financial in nature, other than insurance underwriting as principal, insurance company portfolio investment, real estate development, real estate investment, annuity issuance and merchant banking activities. To do so, a bank must be well capitalized, well managed and have a CRA rating from its primary federal regulator of satisfactory or better. Subsidiary banks of financial holding companies or banks with financial subsidiaries must remain well capitalized and well managed in order to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without regulatory actions or restrictions. Such actions or restrictions could include divestiture of the “financial in nature” subsidiary or subsidiaries. In addition, a financial holding company or a bank may not acquire a company that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature unless each of the subsidiary banks of the financial holding company or the bank has a CRA rating of satisfactory of better. Neither we nor the Bank maintains a financial subsidiary.

Brokered Deposit Restrictions. Insured depository institutions that are categorized as adequately capitalized institutions under the FDI Act and corresponding federal regulations cannot accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits, without receiving a waiver from the FDIC, and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on any deposits. Insured depository institutions that are categorized as undercapitalized capitalized institutions under the FDI Act and corresponding federal regulations may not accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposits. The Bank is not currently subject to such restrictions.
Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations. The federal banking regulatory agencies have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (1) total reported loans for acquisition, construction, land development, and other land represent 100.0% or more of total capital or (2) total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm residential properties and loans for acquisition, construction, land development, and other land represent 300.0% or more of total capital and the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Owner occupied loans are excluded from this second category. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address, among other things, Board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. We are currently operating with real estate loan portfolios within such percentage levels.
Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their entire assessment area, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of such banks. These regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its assessment area when considering applications to establish branches, merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. FIRREA requires federal banking agencies to make public a rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA. In the case of a bank holding company, the CRA performance record of the banks involved in the transaction are reviewed in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with any other bank holding company. An unsatisfactory CRA record could substantially delay approval or result in denial of an application. The Bank received a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent CRA examination.
Consumer Laws and Regulations. The Bank is subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to protect consumers in transactions with the Bank. These laws include, among others, laws regarding unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices, usury laws, and other federal consumer protection statutes. These federal laws include the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Real Estate Procedures Act of 1974, the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, the Truth in Lending Act and the Truth in Savings Act, among others. Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous, and in addition, to those enacted under federal law. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans and conducting other types of transactions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to regulatory sanctions, customer rescission and registration rights, action by state and local attorneys general and civil or criminal liability.
 
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB. The CFPB has broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products. The CFPB officially came into being on July 21, 2011, and rulemaking authority for a range of consumer financial protection laws (such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, among others) transferred from the Federal Reserve and other federal regulators to the CFPB on that date. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with more than $10.0 billion in assets for compliance with these federal consumer laws. The authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with $10.0 billion or less in assets for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with those institutions’ primary regulators. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations of these smaller institutions on a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. Accordingly, the CFPB may participate in examinations of the Bank, which currently has assets of less than $10.0 billion, and could supervise and examine our other direct or indirect subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products or services. The CFPB also has supervisory and examination authority over certain nonbank institutions that offer consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act identifies a number of covered nonbank institutions, and also authorizes the CFPB to identify additional institutions that will be subject to its jurisdiction. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB against certain institutions.

Mortgage Lending Rules. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, financial institutions may not make a residential mortgage loan unless they make a “reasonable and good faith determination” that the consumer has a “reasonable ability” to repay the loan. The Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure but provides a full or partial safe harbor from such defenses for loans that are “qualified mortgages.” On January 10, 2013, the CFPB published final rules to, among other things, specify the types of income and assets that may be considered in the ability-to-repay determination, the permissible sources for income verification, and the required methods of calculating the loan’s monthly payments. Since then the CFPB made certain modifications to these rules. The rules extend the requirement that creditors verify and document a borrower’s income and assets to include all information that creditors rely on in determining repayment ability. The rules also provide further examples of third-party documents that may be relied on for such verification, such as government records and check-cashing or funds-transfer service receipts. The new rules became effective on January 10, 2014. The rules also define “qualified mortgages,” imposing both underwriting standards – for example, a borrower’s debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43.0% – and limits on the terms of their loans. Points and fees are subject to a relatively stringent cap, and the terms include a wide array of payments that may be made in the course of closing a loan. Certain loans, including interest-only loans and negative amortization loans, cannot be qualified mortgages.
 
Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC. Under federal law, including the Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, certain financial institutions, such as the Bank, must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures and controls; a designated BSA officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and customer identification especially in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions, and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, issued final rules under the BSA in July 2016 that clarify and strengthen the due diligence requirements for banks with regard to their customers, which became fully implemented in May 2018.
 
The Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, administers laws and Executive Orders that prohibit U.S. entities from engaging in transactions with certain prohibited parties. OFAC publishes lists of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Generally, if a bank identifies a transaction, account or wire transfer relating to a person or entity on an OFAC list, it must freeze the account or block the transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.
 
Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution’s compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for bank mergers and acquisitions. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing and comply with OFAC sanctions, or to comply with relevant laws and regulations, could have serious legal, reputational and financial consequences for the institution.
 
 20


Privacy. The federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. In addition to applicable federal privacy regulations, the Bank is subject to certain state privacy laws.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The FHLB system, of which the Bank is a member, consists of 11 regional FHLBs governed and regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Board, or FHFB. The FHLBs serve as reserve or credit facilities for member institutions within their assigned regions. The reserves are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. The FHLBs make loans (i.e., advances) to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the FHLB and the Boards of directors of each regional FHLB.
 
As a system member, according to currently existing policies and procedures, the Bank is entitled to borrow from the Dallas FHLB provided it posts acceptable collateral. The Bank is also required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the FHLB. The Bank is in compliance with the stock ownership rules with respect to such advances, commitments and letters of credit and collateral requirements with respect to home mortgage loans and similar obligations. All loans, advances and other extensions of credit made by the FHLB to the Bank are secured by a portion of the respective mortgage loan portfolio, certain other investments and the capital stock of the FHLB held by the Bank.
 
Enforcement Powers. The bank regulatory agencies have broad enforcement powers, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory agreements, breaches of fiduciary duty or the maintenance of unsafe and unsound conditions or practices could subject us or our subsidiaries, including the Bank, as well as their respective officers, directors, and other institution-affiliated parties, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties. For example, the regulatory authorities may appoint the FDIC as conservator or receiver for a banking institution (or the FDIC may appoint itself, under certain circumstances) if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist, including, without limitation, the fact that the banking institution is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized, fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so, fails to submit a timely and acceptable capital restoration plan or materially fails to implement an accepted capital restoration plan.
Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies 
 
The commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by U.S. fiscal policy and the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve. Some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve include changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, the fluctuating availability of borrowings at the “discount window,” open market operations, the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against member banks’ deposits and certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates and assets of foreign branches. These policies influence to a significant extent the overall growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. We cannot predict the nature of future fiscal and monetary policies or the effect of these policies on our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans or future prospects.
New Banking Reform Legislation
 
The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, or the EGRRCPA, directs the federal banking agencies to develop a specified CBLR of not less than 8% and not more than 10%. Banks and bank holding companies with less than $10 billion in total assets that maintain capital in excess of this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements. Federal banking agencies may consider a company’s risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the Community Bank Leverage Ratio.
 
 21


Other key provisions of the EGRRCPA as it relates to community banks and bank holding companies include, but are not limited to: (i) designating mortgages held in portfolio as ‘‘qualified mortgages’’ for banks with less than $10 billion in assets, subject to certain documentation and product limitations; (ii) exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets (and total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5% or less of total assets) from Volcker Rule requirements relating to proprietary trading; (iii) simplifying capital calculations for banks with less than $10 billion in assets by requiring federal banking agencies to establish a community bank leverage ratio of tangible equity to average consolidated assets of not less than 8% or more than 10%, and provide that banks that maintain tangible equity in excess of such ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with risk-based capital and leverage requirements; (iv) assisting smaller banks with obtaining stable funding by providing an exception for reciprocal deposits from FDIC restrictions on acceptance of brokered deposits; (v) raising the eligibility for use of short-form Call Reports from $1 billion to $5 billion in assets; (vi) clarifying definitions pertaining to HVCRE, which require higher capital allocations, so that only loans with increased risk are subject to higher risk weightings; and (vii) changing the eligibility for use of the small bank holding company policy statement from institutions with under $1 billion in assets to institutions with under $3 billion in assets.
 
Impact of Current Laws and Regulations 
 
The cumulative effect of these laws and regulations, while providing certain benefits, adds significantly to the cost of our operations and thus have a negative impact on our profitability. There has also been a notable expansion in recent years of financial service providers that are not subject to the examination, oversight, and other rules and regulations to which we are subject. Those providers, because they are not so highly regulated, may have a competitive advantage over us and may continue to draw large amounts of funds away from traditional banking institutions, with a continuing adverse effect on the banking industry in general. 
Future Legislation and Regulatory Reform
 
From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives related to financial institutions are introduced in Congress and state legislatures. New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions operating in the United States. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute. Future legislation, regulation and policies, and the effects of that legislation and regulation and those policies, may have a significant influence on our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans or future prospects and the overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits. Such legislation, regulation and policies have had a significant effect on the operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans and future prospects of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so.
