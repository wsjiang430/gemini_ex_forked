Overview 
 
We are a medical device company with an innovative approach to the design, development and commercialization of products for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. We believe our competitive advantage is rooted in our unique consumer-focused approach, and the incorporation of modern and innovative technology into our product offerings. Our manufacturing, sales and support activities exclusively focus on our flagship pump platform, the t:slim X2 Insulin Delivery System, or t:slim X2, and our complementary product offerings. The simple-to-use t:slim X2 is based on our proprietary technology platform and is the smallest durable insulin pump available. It is the only pump currently available in the United States that is capable of remote feature updates, which positions us well to address the evolving needs and preferences of differentiated segments of the insulin-dependent diabetes market. By delivering innovative hardware and software solutions, as well as best-in-class customer support, we aim to improve and simplify the lives of people with diabetes and their healthcare providers.

We have commercially launched six insulin pumps in the United States since inception, all of which have been developed using our proprietary technology platform. Three of these pumps have featured continuous glucose monitoring technology, or CGM. In the past four years, we have shipped approximately 84,000 pumps, over 4,000 of which were in international markets, which is representative of our estimated global installed customer base on the typical four-year reimbursement cycle.
 Domestically, we began commercial sales of our first insulin pump product, t:slim, in August 2012 and subsequently commercialized t:flex in May 2015, t:slim G4 in September 2015, t:slim X2 in October 2016, t:slim X2 with Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM integration, or t:slim X2 with G5, in September of 2017 and t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology in August 2018. The Basal-IQ technology is our first-generation Automated Insulin Delivery, or AID, algorithm. This system uses Dexcom’s G6 CGM sensor values to temporarily suspend insulin delivery to help minimize the frequency and/or duration of hypoglycemic events. In the second quarter of 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, also created a new interoperability designation for integrated continuous glucose monitoring, or iCGM, devices. The t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology was the first insulin pump to receive approval for iCGM compatibility, which we expect will streamline the regulatory pathway for integration with future iCGM products as they are approved by the FDA. More recently, in early 2019 the FDA classified our t:slim X2 as the first insulin pump in a new device category referred to as Alternative Controller Enabled infusion pumps, or ACE pumps. We expect this new classification of the t:slim X2 will provide us with more flexibility as we make improvements to current products, create new products and collaborate with third-parties in the development of future AID systems. Interoperability with iCGM and other compatible devices will still require development effort and business agreements. However, the regulatory process can be lengthy and unpredictable, so we believe the FDA’s designation of iCGM products and ACE pumps will, collectively, reduce the overall timeline to commercialize interoperable devices. In the second half of 2018, we began selling the t:slim X2 with G5, in select geographies outside the United States, including Canada. We have discontinued sales of our original t:slim, t:flex and t:slim G4 pumps, and our t:slim X2 hardware platform now represents 100% of new pump shipments. However, we continue to provide ongoing service and support for our earlier products.
 All people with type 1 diabetes require daily rapid-acting insulin, but only a subset of people with type 2 diabetes require daily rapid-acting insulin, as a large majority manage their therapy through improvements in diet and exercise, oral medications, or injectable therapies such as long acting insulin. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, 2017 National Diabetes Statistics Report, approximately 23 million people in the United States had diagnosed diabetes, of which type 1 diabetes accounts for approximately 5% to 10%, or approximately 1.2 to 2.3 million people. Of people with type 2 diabetes in the United States, the CDC reports that approximately 14%, or 3.2 million people, manage their diabetes with insulin only. The International Diabetes Federation, or the IDF, estimates that in 2017 approximately 425 million people had diabetes worldwide, of which approximately 10%, or 42.5 million, had type 1. Our target market consists of people in the United States and select geographies worldwide, who require daily rapid-acting insulin.
 Our insulin pump products are generally considered durable medical equipment and have an expected lifespan of at least four years. In addition to selling insulin pumps, we sell disposable products that are used together with our pumps and replaced every few days, including cartridges for storing and delivering insulin, and infusion sets that connect the insulin pump to a user’s body.

In the United States, our insulin pumps are compatible with the Tandem Device Updater, a revolutionary tool that allows pump users to update their pumps’ software quickly and easily from a personal computer. The Tandem Device Updater provides our in-warranty domestic customers potential access to new and enhanced features and functionality faster than the industry has been able to in the past. The first use of our Tandem Device Updater was for our deployment of the latest t:slim software to in-warranty t:slim pumps purchased before April 2015. Since that time, we set a new standard of care in our industry by offering all existing in-warranty t:slim X2 customers in the United States two significant software updates: (i) integration with the Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM system in September 2017; and (ii) an upgrade to our new Basal-IQ technology and integration with Dexcom’s G6 CGM in August 2018.  Our Tandem Device Updater positions us to bring future innovations and AID algorithms to t:slim X2 customers, independent of the typical four-year insurance pump reimbursement cycle. Though we have not utilized our Tandem Device Updater to perform software updates for devices outside the United States, we are currently developing that capability, and intend to do so in the future.
 
Our innovative approach to product design and development is consumer-focused and based on our extensive study of behavioral sciences, as we believe the user is the primary decision maker when purchasing an insulin pump, and the healthcare provider is a key influencer. Our behavioral science research consists of interviews, focus groups and online surveys to understand what people with diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers are seeking in order to improve diabetes therapy management. We also apply the science of human factors to our design and development process, which seeks to optimize our devices, so that users can successfully operate them in their intended environment.
 
We developed our products to provide the specific features that people with insulin-dependent diabetes seek in a next-generation insulin pump. Our proprietary technology platform allows us to design the slimmest and smallest durable insulin pumps on the market, without sacrificing insulin capacity. Our t:slim X2 platform features our patented Micro-Delivery technology, a miniaturized pumping mechanism that draws insulin from a flexible bag within the pump’s cartridge, rather than relying on a syringe and plunger mechanism. It also features an easy-to-navigate software architecture and a vivid color touchscreen. In addition, it features an advanced Bluetooth radio capable of communicating with multiple compatible devices, such as a CGM sensor, and possibly a blood glucose meter or mobile device application. Our platform has a micro-USB connection that supports a rechargeable battery and, in the United States, software updates through the Tandem Device Updater. In addition, this connectivity allows for uploads to our t:connect Diabetes Management Application, or t:connect, in the United States, and other compatible diabetes management applications. t:connect is our custom cloud-based data management application that provides customers and healthcare providers a fast, easy and visual way to display therapy management data from the pump and supported blood glucose meters. In April 2017, we launched the t:connect HCP Portal, which is designed to streamline healthcare providers’ use of the original t:connect application and improve office efficiency.
 
Based on customer surveys, approximately half of our domestic customers are new to insulin pump therapy, and the average age of our existing domestic customers is 32 years old, with relatively equal distribution between men and women. Of our customers who converted from another manufacturers’ pump, the greatest percentage converted from Medtronic plc, or Medtronic, followed by Animas Corporation, or Animas. In the fourth quarter of 2017, and throughout 2018, we saw a meaningful increase in our sales to former Animas pump users. 
 
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our consolidated sales were $183.9 million, $107.6 million, and $84.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our net loss was $122.6 million, $73.0 million, and $83.4 million, respectively. Worldwide pump sales accounted for 67%, 66%, and 74% of our total sales, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, while pump-related supplies and accessories accounted for the remainder in each year. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $600.1 million and $477.6 million, respectively. This included $147.4 million and $56.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation charges and non-cash changes in the fair value of common stock warrants as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
In the United States, we have rapidly increased sales since our commercial launch by expanding our sales, clinical and marketing organization, by developing, commercializing and marketing multiple differentiated products that utilize our proprietary technology platform and consumer-focused approach, and by providing strong customer support. More recently, our sales have also rapidly increased following the scaled launch of t:slim X2 in geographies outside the United States. We believe that by demonstrating our product benefits and the shortcomings of existing insulin therapies, more people will choose our insulin pumps for their therapy needs, allowing us to further penetrate and expand the market both domestically and outside of the United States. We also believe we are well positioned to address consumers’ needs and preferences with our current products and products under development and by offering customers access to our future innovations through the Tandem Device Updater, as they are approved by the FDA, and as we develop the capability to offer the Tandem Device Updater outside the United States. At the same time, by rapidly innovating and offering new product features and benefits through the t:slim X2 platform, we are able to leverage a shared global manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure. In the United States, we are able to leverage a single sales, marketing, and clinical organization, as well as our domestic customer support services. In Canada, we have a separate sales organization and customer support infrastructure, both of which benefit from close collaboration with our United States organization. In other international geographies, we have contracted with experienced distribution partners to commercialize and support our t:slim X2 platform.

Our headquarters and our manufacturing facility are located in San Diego, California and we employed 653 full-time employees as of December 31, 2018.
 
The Market 
 
Diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure. The disease is categorized by improper function of the pancreas when it either does not produce enough insulin or the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a life-sustaining hormone that allows cells in the body to absorb glucose from blood and convert it to energy. As a result, a person with diabetes cannot utilize the glucose properly and it continues to accumulate in the blood. If not closely monitored and properly treated, diabetes can lead to serious medical complications, including damage to various tissues and organs, seizures, coma and death. 
 
The IDF estimates that in 2017, approximately 425 million people had diabetes worldwide and that by 2045, this number will increase to 629 million people worldwide. According to the CDC, approximately 23 million people in the United States have diagnosed diabetes. 
 
There are two primary types of diabetes: 
 
 
• | The IDF estimates that people with type 1 diabetes represent approximately 10% of the diabetes population worldwide, or approximately 42.5 million people. Similarly, the CDC estimates that people with type 1 diabetes represent approximately 5% to 10% of individuals with diagnosed diabetes in the United States, or approximately 1.2 to 2.3 million people.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The IDF estimates that people with type 2 diabetes represent approximately 90% of the diabetes population worldwide, or approximately 382.5 million people. Similarly, the CDC estimates that people with type 2 diabetes represent approximately 90% to 95% of individuals with diagnosed diabetes in the United States, or approximately 20.7 to 21.8 million people. Initially, many people with type 2 diabetes attempt to manage their diabetes with improvements in diet, exercise and oral medications. However, as their diabetes advances, some patients progress to requiring injectable therapies, such as long-acting insulin, and a subset of this population will require daily rapid-acting insulin therapy. Approximately 14% of people with type 2 diabetes in the United States, or 3.2 million people, manage their diabetes with insulin only.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Throughout this Annual Report, we refer to people with type 1 diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes who require daily rapid acting insulin as people with insulin-dependent diabetes. 
 
People with insulin-dependent diabetes require intensive insulin therapy to manage their blood glucose levels within a healthy range, which is typically between 70-120 milligrams per deciliter, or mg/dL. Blood glucose levels can be affected by many factors, such as type or quantity of food eaten, illness, stress and exercise. Hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose levels, can cause a variety of long-term effects or complications, including damage to various tissues and organs, seizures, coma or death. Hyperglycemia, or high blood glucose levels, can also cause a variety of long-term effects or complications, including cardiovascular disease and damage to various tissues and organs. It can also cause the emergency condition ketoacidosis, which can result in vomiting, shortness of breath, coma or death. According to the CDC, in 2014 there were approximately 245,000 emergency department visits for adults with hypoglycemia, and approximately 207,000 visits for hyperglycemic crisis in the United States.
 
There are two primary therapies used by people with insulin-dependent diabetes, insulin injections and insulin pumps, each of which is designed to supplement or replace the insulin-producing function of the pancreas. 
 
MDI Therapy: The use of insulin injections is often referred to as Multiple Daily Injection, or MDI, therapy. MDI therapy involves the administration of a rapid-acting insulin before meals, or bolus insulin, to bring blood glucose levels down into the healthy range. MDI therapy may also require a separate injection of a long-acting insulin, or basal insulin, to control glucose levels between meals; this type of insulin is typically taken once or twice per day. 
 
MDI can be administered using a traditional needle and syringe with a vial of insulin, or with an insulin pen. When using a traditional needle and syringe, insulin is drawn from a vial to fill the syringe. It is then injected into the person’s body by manually depressing the syringe’s plunger which pushes against the volume of insulin and dispenses it through the needle and into the person’s subcutaneous tissue.
 
By comparison, to inject insulin using an insulin pen, the person selects a requested amount of insulin using a dial. Next, the person depresses a button, rather than pushing against a plunger, to inject the insulin. Some insulin pens come prefilled with insulin and are disposable. However, others are reusable for extended periods and insulin is inserted into the pen in the form of a prefilled vial that is then dispensed using the pen. Also, more recently, people have begun using insulin pens with additional features, which are 
 5

referred to as smart pens. These devices may feature connectivity with mobile apps, and may automatically import glucose readings, calculate recommended dosages, and keep track of insulin dose history.

Insulin Pump Therapy: Insulin pumps are used to perform what is often referred to as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, or insulin pump therapy. Generally, durable insulin pumps use a programmable device and an infusion set to administer insulin into the person’s body, while patch insulin pumps are disposable and adhere to the body without an infusion set. 
 
Insulin pump therapy uses only rapid-acting insulin to fulfill both mealtime (bolus) and background (basal) requirements. Insulin pump therapy allows a person to customize their bolus and basal insulin doses to meet their insulin needs throughout the day and is intended to more closely resemble the physiologic function of a healthy pancreas.
 
Insulin pump therapy can provide a person with insulin-dependent diabetes with benefits when used independently or in conjunction with CGM. A pump featuring CGM is known as a sensor augmented pump, or SAP, which allows the pump to receive CGM data directly from a wearable sensor. In addition, SAPs may feature an AID algorithm that is designed to automatically adjust a person’s insulin delivery based on their CGM trends to help minimize the frequency and/or duration of hypoglycemia and/or hyperglycemic events. Insulin pumps may also feature connectivity with mobile apps and data management applications, which are used by the pump user, caregivers and healthcare providers, to quickly and easily identify meaningful insights and trends, allowing them to refine therapy and lifestyle choices for better management of their diabetes.
 
Insulin pump therapy has been shown to provide people with insulin-dependent diabetes with numerous advantages relative to MDI therapy. The following chart illustrates some of the key advantages and disadvantages of using MDI therapy versus insulin pump therapy:

Comparison of MDI Therapy vs. Insulin Pump Therapy 
 
 
Therapy | Advantages | Disadvantages 
-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MDI | ● Less training and shorter time to educate ● Less cost (however, insulin pens and smart pens are more expensive than a traditional needle and syringe) ● Lower risk of technological malfunction | ● Requires injections up to seven times per day ● Delivers insulin less accurately than insulin pumps ● Results in greater variability in blood glucose levels or less accurate glycemic control ● Requires more planning around and restrictions regarding meals and exercise 
Insulin Pump | ● Eliminates individual insulin injections ● Delivers insulin more accurately and precisely than injections ● Often improves HbA1c, a common measure of blood glucose levels over time ● Fewer large swings in blood glucose levels ● Provides greater flexibility with meals, exercise and daily schedules ● Can improve quality of life ● Reduces severe low blood glucose episodes ● Eliminates unpredictable effects of intermediate or long-acting insulin ● Allows exercise without having to eat large amounts of carbohydrates, as insulin delivery can be adjusted ● Provides access to AID features | ● Requires intensive education on insulin pump therapy and management ● Wearing a pump can be bothersome ● More costly ● Risk of diabetic ketoacidosis if the catheter comes out and insulin infusion is interrupted 

 
According to the American Diabetes Association, it is estimated that in 2015, between 750,000 and 1 million people worldwide used an insulin pump. Domestically, we estimate that 550,000 people in the United States use an insulin pump, of which approximately 80% have type 1 diabetes. There are a variety of insulin pump manufacturers worldwide, while domestically, we are currently one of only two commercial durable insulin pump manufacturers and there is one programmable commercial patch insulin pump manufacturer.
 
We believe that the distinct advantages and increased awareness of insulin pump therapy as compared to other available insulin therapies will continue to generate demand for insulin pump devices and pump-related supplies. We also believe that the adoption of insulin pump therapy would have been even greater if not for the significant and fundamental perceived shortcomings of durable syringe-and-plunger insulin pumps currently available, which we refer to as traditional pumps. We further believe that recent and ongoing developments in the use of CGM technology and AID algorithms in conjunction with insulin pump therapy will continue to provide people with insulin-dependent diabetes benefits that will make insulin pump therapy an even more attractive treatment alternative.

The Opportunity
 
The foundation of our consumer-focused approach is behavioral sciences, through which we seek to better understand the opportunity within the insulin-dependent diabetes market through research. This opportunity includes both the introduction of the benefits of pump therapy to people using MDI and the introduction of the features and benefits of our pumps to people who use traditional pumps. We have conducted extensive research obtained from interviews, focus groups and online surveys to understand what people with diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers are seeking to improve in diabetes therapy management. Based on our research, we believe that the limited adoption of insulin pump therapy by people with insulin-dependent diabetes has been largely due to the shortcomings of traditional pumps currently available. These shortcomings include:  
 
Antiquated style. While consumer electronic devices have rapidly evolved in form and function over the past decade, traditional pumps have not achieved similar advances. Our market research has shown that consumers believe traditional pumps resemble dated consumer technology, as they generally still feature small display screens, push-button interfaces, plastic cases and disposable batteries. Because an insulin pump must be used multiple times throughout the day, often in social settings, its style and appearance are important to users. Our market research has shown that traditional insulin pump users frequently report being embarrassed by the style of their traditional pump. For current MDI users, the style of traditional pumps is often cited as a reason for not adopting pump therapy. 
 
Not adaptable. Traditional pumps are typically sold as a single-product offering that are then iterated to add features, rather than being designed as a technology platform that is easily updatable to support new features and functionality as they are developed and approved by the FDA. We believe this is due to hardware and user interface limitations that prevent traditional pumps from being easily updatable to provide new feature offerings. As a result, consumers have had limited product choices from pump manufacturers, and healthcare providers are required to learn a greater number of user interfaces. We believe the lack of adaptability of traditional pump platforms has been a restricting factor in offering people with diabetes differentiated product features to best meet their therapy needs.
 
Bulky size. Our market research has shown that consumers view traditional pumps as large, bulky and inconvenient to carry or wear, especially when compared to modern consumer electronic devices, such as smartphones. The size of the pump further contributes to users being embarrassed by the pump. This complaint, along with concerns relating to how and where the pump can be utilized due to its size and shape, is frequently cited among users of traditional pumps. For current MDI users, the size of traditional pumps is often communicated as a reason for not adopting pump therapy. 
 
Difficult to learn and teach. Traditional pumps often rely on complicated and outdated technology and are not intuitive to operate. Our research has shown that it can take several days to competently learn how to use traditional pumps, and when an AID feature is offered, the training time may take even longer. This may lead to frustration, frequent mistakes and additional training, each of which may discourage adoption. We believe difficult-to-use traditional pumps result in a higher frequency of calls by the user to the pump manufacturer or their healthcare provider for support, adding both frustration and cost to the learning process. We also believe that the complicated functionality of traditional pumps significantly limits the willingness of healthcare providers to recommend insulin pump therapy to many patients and limits the number of patients they consider as candidates for insulin pump therapy.
 
Complicated to use. Traditional pumps are designed with linear software menus, which require the user to follow display screens sequentially, limiting their ability to access information within workflows or easily return to the starting point. Most traditional pumps require users to scroll through numerous menus and input multiple commands to make selections. This process, which must be performed multiple times per day, can be frustrating and time-consuming. It may also lead to added complexity when a user is programming and operating an AID feature. Our research has shown that the complicated nature of the process can lead to confusion, frustration and fear of making mistakes with the pump, which in turn can limit the user’s willingness to take advantage of a pump’s features, or even discourage use entirely. 
 
8

Pump mechanism limitations. Traditional pumps utilize a mechanism in which a lead screw drives a plunger to deliver insulin. This design limits the ability to reduce the size of the pump due to the length and diameter of the syringe and lead screw. 
 
Traditional Pump Mechanism 
 
We believe that these shortcomings of traditional pumps have limited the adoption of pump therapy. By addressing these issues, there is a meaningful opportunity to not only motivate MDI users to adopt pump therapy, but also to respond to the concerns and unmet needs of traditional insulin pump users thereby encouraging increased demand for our pumps. 
Our Solution 
 
We develop our insulin pump technology and related product offerings using a consumer-focused approach. We initially rely on the use of behavioral sciences, including extensive research to ascertain what people with insulin-dependent diabetes require and prefer from their diabetes therapy. We then look to modern consumer technology for inspiration and design our hardware and software solutions to meet the specific demands of people with diabetes. Our development process then applies the science of human factors, which optimizes a device or system to the intended user through iterative usability and design refinement. This multi-step approach has resulted in products that provide users with the distinct features and functionality they seek and in a manner that makes the features usable and intuitive. All of our insulin pump products were developed using this customer-focused approach, as were our related product offerings, including the Tandem Device Updater, t:connect and our customized t:lock connector, which is used to connect our pump cartridge to our infusion set offerings. We expect to continue to utilize this approach as we develop new product offerings and innovations.
 
Our flagship pump platform, t:slim X2, which we believe addresses the shortcomings of currently available traditional pumps, features: 
 
Contemporary style. t:slim X2, as well as our products under development, has the look and feel of a modern consumer electronic device, such as a smartphone. Relying on extensive consumer input and feedback received during the development process, we believe the modern and innovative design of our products addresses the embarrassing appearance-related concerns of insulin pump users. Key product features such as a high-resolution, color touchscreen with shatter-resistant glass, aluminum casing and rechargeable battery, make t:slim X2 unique in the insulin pump market.

Our t:slim X2 Insulin Pump Form Factor (Actual Size) 
 
Adaptable platform. Our t:slim X2 platform is highly adaptable as a result of a number of features that are inherent within our proprietary technology, including our easy-to-navigate software architecture and touchscreen user interface. Our t:slim X2 is also compatible with the Tandem Device Updater, which is a tool currently available in the United States that allows pump users to update their pumps’ software quickly and easily from a personal computer. This tool uniquely allowed us to bring new features and benefits, such as CGM integration and our Basal-IQ technology to customers within their typical four-year insurance pump replacement cycle. It also positions us to bring future innovations and AID algorithms to t:slim X2 customers both domestically and outside of the United States. Our touchscreen also allows us to efficiently implement new language functionality; t:slim X2 is currently available in seven different languages. We believe the adaptability of our pump platform uniquely positions us to address the needs and preferences of people with insulin-dependent diabetes, and to do so quickly as those needs and preferences change and the functionality of our products evolves.
 
Compact size. With a narrow profile, similar to many smartphones, our t:slim X2 can easily and discreetly fit into a pocket. t:slim X2 is the slimmest and smallest durable insulin pump on the market, while still offering a cartridge with 300 units of insulin. More specifically, our t:slim X2 is 38% smaller than the newest insulin pump form factor offered by our leading competitor. The size and shape of our t:slim X2 was designed to provide increased flexibility with respect to how and where a pump can be worn. Based on extensive consumer input during development, we believe our products address both the embarrassment and functionality concerns related to the size and inconvenience of carrying a traditional pump.

t:slim X2 Profile (Actual Size) 
 
Easy to learn and teach. Our technology platform allows for the use of a color touchscreen and easy-to-navigate software architecture, providing users intuitive access to the key functions of their pumps directly from the home screen. Insulin pump users can quickly learn how to efficiently navigate their pumps’ software, thereby enabling healthcare providers to spend less time teaching a person how to use the pump and more time improving management of their diabetes. We believe these features also allow healthcare providers to more efficiently train people to use our pump and have a higher degree of confidence that users can successfully operate our pump, including its more advanced features, such as our Basal-IQ technology. Our touchscreen technology also allows us to offer our t:simulator App, which permits anyone to experience our easy-to-navigate software for any of our pumps free of charge on a mobile device. We believe the ease with which our pump can be learned and taught, and the accessibility of our t:simulator App that broadly demonstrates our software technology, will help attract consumers who may have been frustrated or intimidated by traditional pumps. 
t:simulator App Accessible Through Mobile Device

Intuitive to use. Similar to what is found in modern consumer electronic devices, the embedded software displayed on our color touchscreen features intuitive and commonly interpreted colors, language, icons and feedback. Our software also features numerous shortcuts, including a simple way to return to the home screen and view critical information for therapy management. These features were designed to enable users to operate their pump more efficiently and with greater confidence, and to expand the set of therapy features they regularly utilize. Users can also execute most tasks in fewer steps than traditional pumps, which we believe further encourages people to use more advanced pump features. For example, our Basal-IQ technology feature, adds only one new screen. We believe the intuitive features of our pump also allow users to more efficiently manage their diabetes without fear or frustration.
Easy-to-Navigate Pump Software Architecture  
 
Innovative technology. Our Micro-Delivery technology is unique compared to traditional pumps. Its miniaturized pumping mechanism draws insulin from a flexible bag within the pump’s cartridge rather than relying on a mechanical syringe and lead screw mechanism. Our technology was tested under both typical and extreme operating conditions and is designed to last for at least the anticipated four-year warranty of the pump. Our technology allows us to reduce the size of the device as compared to traditional pumps, making t:slim X2 the slimmest and smallest durable insulin pump on the market. In addition, our technology is capable of delivering the smallest increment of insulin compared to any pump currently available, which allows insulin therapy to be individualized for each user. 
Quick Access to Pump History

Our Insulin Pump Mechanism 
 
The t:slim X2 features a micro-USB connection that supports a rapid rechargeable battery and uploads to t:connect, both of which can be performed without disconnecting or interrupting insulin delivery. This connection also supports software updates through the Tandem Device Updater. 
 
We believe the t:slim X2 platform will allow us to further penetrate and expand the insulin pump therapy market by addressing the specific product and technology limitations associated with traditional pumps that have been raised by people with diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers. We also believe our technology under development provides us with the opportunity to address unmet needs in the insulin-dependent diabetes market, including further advancements in AID and device miniaturization. 
 
Our Strategy 
 
Our goal is to significantly expand and further penetrate the insulin-dependent diabetes market and become the leading provider of insulin pump therapy by focusing on both consumer and clinical needs. We believe we are uniquely positioned to address differentiated segments of the insulin-dependent diabetes market by continually using behavioral sciences to determine what people with insulin-dependent diabetes and healthcare providers desire from insulin therapy, and by offering an adaptable insulin pump that can provide features and functionality to respond to evolving needs and preferences. At the same time, by rapidly innovating and offering new product features and benefits through the t:slim X2 platform, we are also able to leverage a shared global manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure. In Canada, we have a separate sales organization and customer support infrastructure, both of which benefit from close collaboration with our United States organization. In other international geographies, we contract with experienced distribution partners to commercialize and support our t:slim X2 platform.
 
To achieve our goal, we intend to pursue the following business strategies:
 
Drive domestic adoption of our products through our sales, marketing and clinical infrastructure. We have achieved commercial success by investing in the development of our domestic sales, marketing and clinical infrastructure. With this base infrastructure, we believe we are well-positioned to introduce our products to more people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers, while continuing to provide the highest level of customer service. For example, we are leveraging our infrastructure by marketing our new products, including t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ, to primarily the same healthcare providers as our previous pump products, thereby increasing our efficiency. We believe our continued investments in this infrastructure, when combined with the launch and marketing of new products, will drive continued adoption of our products, while efficiently increasing our revenues over the long-term.
 
Drive adoption of our products outside of the United States through our Canadian sales and customer support infrastructure, and through our distribution arrangements. We have invested in a small direct sales and customer support infrastructure for our new commercialization efforts in Canada. In other select international geographies, we have contracted with experienced insulin pump distribution partners who are responsible for sales and customer support services in specific geographies. This strategy allowed us to quickly establish access to international markets and support the needs of more people with diabetes outside the United States without the upfront investment and complexities of creating a local infrastructure in each location. We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities to expand into additional international geographies, either directly or through independent distributors. 
 13


Promote awareness of our products to consumers, their caregivers and healthcare providers. Our products were specifically designed to address the shortcomings of currently available technologies that we believe have limited the adoption of insulin pump therapy. We intend to continue our direct-to-consumer marketing to promote the insulin therapy features and functionalities offered by our products through our website, the use of social media and online advertising tools, our t:simulator App and motivational spokespeople at industry forums and events. We also expect to leverage our domestic and Canadian sales and clinical forces, together with our marketing specialists, to cultivate relationships with diabetes clinics, insulin-prescribing healthcare professionals and other key opinion leaders. By promoting awareness of our products, we believe we will be able to attract users of our competitors’ insulin pump products, as well other pump therapies and MDI, to our products.
 
Advance our clinical activities to further demonstrate that use of our pump products may contribute to improved clinical outcomes. Data published in the Diabetes Care medical journal from a pivotal study of our t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology demonstrated a significant reduction in hypoglycemia without rebound hyperglycemia, compared to time on a t:slim X2 Pump with integrated CGM and no automated insulin suspension. In addition, data analyzed from t:connect suggests that use of our pump products may provide users with improved clinical outcomes. For example, we published retrospective user data comparing our t:slim G4 SAP and a leading competitor’s SAP. Our SAP demonstrated statistically significant clinical advantages, including reduced hypoglycemia, increased time in range, and improved overall glycemic control, despite approximately half of our competitors’ SAP users actively using a feature that suspends insulin delivery if blood glucose levels fall below a preset threshold. This study suggests that our simple-to-use touchscreen interface may translate to improved clinical outcomes for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. We also continue to be actively involved in multiple clinical trials supporting the use of our AID products in development, which are designed to demonstrate the clinical benefits associated with these products. We plan to continue to invest in clinical activities intended to demonstrate that the use of our products contributes to improved clinical outcomes. 
 
Continue to innovate to provide products that address the unmet needs of people in the insulin-dependent diabetes market. We believe the t:slim X2 platform allows us to provide the most sophisticated and intuitive insulin pump therapy on the market. In addition, our Tandem Device Updater, which is currently available in the United States, is designed to allow pump users to quickly and easily update their pump’s software from a personal computer. We successfully demonstrated the utility of this tool in the third quarter of 2017 when, following FDA approval, we simultaneously offered Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM integration to both existing and new t:slim X2 users. Following FDA approval of our Basal-IQ technology, we were able to leverage the t:slim X2 platform to allow in-warranty customers to update their pumps’ software to include our first AID algorithm. This eliminated the need for disruptive and costly trade-in programs to upgrade hardware to newer platforms. Historically, software updates offered through the Tandem Device Updater have been at no cost, however in the future we may opt to apply charges for updates in certain circumstances. We also intend to offer use of the Tandem Device Updater to customers outside the United States, subject to any required regulatory approvals and our compliance with applicable privacy regulations in specific international geographies. In addition, we plan to leverage the t:slim X2 platform to continue to pursue advances in AID, including through strategic agreements and commercial product development efforts. As examples of these efforts, we have entered into development agreements with Dexcom, Inc., or Dexcom, to allow the integration of our insulin pumps with Dexcom’s currently-available CGM systems. We also entered into a license agreement with TypeZero Technologies, LLC, or TypeZero, which was acquired by Dexcom in August 2018, to allow the integration of TypeZero’s AID algorithms. In addition, we intend to continue to explore additional features, functionality and mobile applications for the t:slim X2 platform, as well as a next-generation pump platform, in order to address differentiated segments of the insulin-dependent diabetes market.

Invest in our consumer-focused approach. We believe our consumer-focused approach to product design, marketing and customer care is a key differentiator. Our extensive behavioral science research involving people with diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers has driven the design and development of our products and customer care model. This approach allows us to add the product features most requested by people with insulin-dependent diabetes, thereby affording the consumer the opportunity to more efficiently manage their diabetes. We will continue to apply the study of behavioral sciences throughout the design, development and continuous improvement of our products, as well as in the identification of work flow and process improvements and to aid in our customer retention efforts. We will continue to invest in our consumer-focused approach throughout our business. 
 
Broaden direct access to third-party payor reimbursement for our products in the United States. We believe third-party reimbursement is an important determinant in driving consumer adoption of insulin pump therapy. We also believe customer and healthcare provider interest in our products is an important factor that enhances our prospect of contracting with third-party payors. We intend to intensify our efforts to encourage third-party payors to establish direct reimbursement for our products as we expand our market presence and product offerings. We may also pursue additional reimbursement for product features currently in development, such as advanced AID algorithms. In addition, we also plan to participate in clinical studies to demonstrate the benefits of our products relative to other pump products and therapies as a way to gain support from third-party payors.

Leverage our manufacturing operations to achieve cost and production efficiencies. We manufacture our products at our facilities located in San Diego, California. We utilize a semi-automated manufacturing process for our pump products and disposable cartridges. We have significantly increased our manufacturing output since we began commercialization of our products. During 2017, we relocated our manufacturing operations to our new, 50,000 square foot Barnes Canyon facility, which became fully operational at the beginning of 2018. This facility doubled our previous manufacturing capacity for both insulin pumps and cartridges and expanded warehousing for infusion set supplies. The facility is designed to maximize efficiencies in our manufacturing processes and workflows and allow us to further expand our production capacity by replicating our production lines within the same facility. Continued growth in the demand for our products will likely require that we expand our manufacturing, warehouse and logistics facilities in the future. As demand for our products increases, we intend to drive operational efficiencies by leveraging our manufacturing infrastructure, which we expect will result in improvements in gross margin over the long-term. In addition, because the t:slim X2 platform is highly adaptable and can provide new features and functionality through remote software updates, our current systems will not need to change significantly to support new features as they are approved by the FDA, which we expect will create additional manufacturing efficiencies for our current platform.
 
Our Technology Platform 
 
We have developed an innovative technology platform that we believe is fundamental to the ease-of-use and functionality of t:slim X2 and will provide the foundation for the development of our future products. The key elements of our current technology platform are: 
 
Advanced core technology. Our patented Micro-Delivery technology is our miniaturized pumping mechanism, which is unique compared to traditional pumps. It allows us to reduce the size of the pump as compared to traditional pumps. It was also designed to provide precise dosing as frequently as every five minutes and in increments as small as 0.001 u/hr, or units per hour, as compared to the smallest increment available in traditional pumps, which is 0.025 u/hr. This technology also helps prevent unintentional insulin delivery by limiting the volume of insulin that can be delivered to a person at any one time. 
 
Easy-to-navigate embedded software architecture. Our technology platform was developed using an iterative human factors design process that results in the intuitive software architecture which features commonly interpreted colors, language, icons and feedback. This allows the user to easily navigate the system and perform necessary functions in fewer steps than traditional pumps, including a one-touch method to return to the home screen. Our intuitive software architecture is designed to facilitate ease of learning, teaching and use for traditional pump functionality as well as more advanced features such as AID. The flexible software architecture also facilitates updates to the software through the Tandem Device Updater, which is currently available in the United States, without requiring any hardware changes.
 
Vivid color touchscreen. Our full color touchscreen allows users to access a streamlined, easy-to-use interface that promotes user confidence. The high-grade, shatter-resistant glass touchscreen provides the user the ability to enter numbers and access features directly, rather than scrolling through numerous screens and options. The touchscreen facilitates safety features that were designed to prevent unintended pump operations. The touchscreen also supports enhanced visual and tactile feedback. 
 
Lithium-polymer rechargeable battery technology. Our products are the first and only insulin pumps to use a rechargeable battery, unlike traditional pumps that rely on expensive disposable batteries. By using a built-in rechargeable battery, we eliminate the risk of losing personal settings associated with replacing batteries. Our lithium-polymer rechargeable battery charges rapidly with a standard micro-USB connection, and a full charge lasts for five to seven days depending on CGM use. Users report that they keep their battery powered by charging it for just 10 to 15 minutes each day, often while showering or commuting with the use of the car charger. Our battery allows for accessible monitoring of the current charge level on the device’s home screen. Our battery has also been tested to last for the four-year warranty life of the pump. 
 
Compatibility and connectivity. Our PC- and Mac-compatible, cloud-based data management application, t:connect, provides our domestic insulin pump users a fast, easy and visual way to display therapy management data from all of our pump products and supported blood glucose meters. Additionally, our pump platform enables rapid data uploads through a micro-USB connection, without interrupting insulin delivery. Internationally, we offer our customers connectivity to a third-party diabetes management application. Providing connectivity to a data management platform empowers people with diabetes, as well as their caregivers and healthcare providers, to quickly and easily identify meaningful insights and trends, allowing them to fine-tune therapy and lifestyle choices for better control of their diabetes.

Our Products 
 
We have commercially launched six insulin pumps since inception, all of which have been developed using our proprietary technology platform. Domestically, we began commercial sales of our first product, t:slim, in August 2012 and subsequently commercialized t:flex in May 2015, t:slim G4 in September 2015, t:slim X2 in October 2016, t:slim X2 with G5 integration in September of 2017 and t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology in August 2018. Internationally, we launched the t:slim X2 with G5 in September 2018. Our t:slim X2 hardware platform now represents 100% of new pump shipments, but we continue to provide ongoing service and support to existing t:slim, t:slim G4 and t:flex customers. Commercial Products
 
In the past four years, we have shipped approximately 84,000 pumps, over 4,000 of which were in international markets, which is representative of our estimated global installed customer based on the typical four-year insurance pump reimbursement cycle. Today, our commercial efforts exclusively focus on the manufacturing, sale and support of our flagship pump platform, the t:slim X2 insulin delivery system. 
The t:slim X2 Insulin Delivery System
 
The t:slim X2 insulin delivery system is our proprietary pump platform comprised of a t:slim X2 pump, its 300-unit disposable insulin cartridge and an infusion set. We began commercial sales of t:slim X2 in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2016. Measuring 2.0 x 3.1 x 0.6 inches, t:slim X2 is the slimmest and smallest durable insulin pump on the market. It is also the only commercially available insulin pump featuring optional integration with Dexcom’s CGM. CGM is a therapy that provides users with real-time access to their glucose levels as well as trend information. Our agreements with Dexcom provide us non-exclusive licenses to integrate our product platform with the Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM System and Dexcom G6 CGM System. 
 
t:slim X2 also features new hardware advancements, including a two-way Bluetooth wireless technology radio for communicating with more than one external device at a time. Domestically, we sell the t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology, and outside the United States, we sell the t:slim X2 with G5.
 
Consistent with our prior generation insulin pumps, the t:slim X2 pump platform features a vivid, full color touchscreen made of high-grade, shatter-resistant glass that provides users the ability to enter numbers and access features directly, rather than scrolling through a list of numbers and screens. We designed the streamlined, user-friendly interface of our products to facilitate rapid access to the features people use most, such as delivering a bolus, viewing remaining insulin on board, viewing insulin cartridge volume and monitoring current pump status and settings. The interface also includes an Options Menu that provides quick and intuitive navigation to key insulin management features, pump settings, cartridge loading and use history. With just a simple tap of our logo on the pump touchscreen the user immediately returns to the home screen where important administrative features are displayed, including the current battery charge level, a time and date display, and an LED indicator for alerts, alarms and reminders. 
 
In addition, the t:slim X2 allows for the creation of multiple customizable personal profiles, each supporting up to 16 timed insulin delivery settings. This feature allows users to manage their day-to-day insulin therapy with less effort and interruption. Users can quickly and easily adjust insulin settings based on a number of key factors, including basal rate, correction factor, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio and target blood glucose levels. 
 
Furthermore, the t:slim X2 features a black aluminum case and chrome trim, giving it the look and feel of a modern consumer electronic device, such as a smartphone. It is also watertight, with an IPX7 rating, eliminating concerns about accidentally getting it wet. The t:slim X2 also features a micro-USB connection that supports charging the lithium-polymer battery, software updates through the Tandem Device Updater in the United States, and rapid data uploads to either t:connect or the third-party Glooko diabetes data management application.
 
In February 2019, we received FDA approval of our de novo application to down-classify the t:slim X2 to a Class II 510(k) device, under the new insulin pump classification referred to as ACE pumps. This classification is intended to help expedite future FDA review of changes to our pump hardware and integration with future products supporting interoperability initiatives. However, we anticipate that the software component of our products related to AID features, such as our Basal-IQ technology, will continue to be subject to review by the FDA under the class III PMA device standards.
 
t:slim X2 Insulin Delivery System with Basal-IQ Technology
 
In the United States, we offer the t:slim X2 with our Basal-IQ technology feature. This is our first commercial AID offering. 
 16


The t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology utilizes Dexcom G6 sensor values to support our AID algorithm, which is designed to temporarily suspend insulin delivery to help minimize the frequency and/or duration of hypoglycemic events. All new domestic pumps are shipped with Basal-IQ technology, and it is then at the discretion of the user and the user’s healthcare provider to determine whether or not to use this feature with CGM integration. It is the first and only CGM integrated insulin pump system that does not require fingersticks for calibration or diabetes treatment decisions. Our Basal-IQ technology was developed internally in consultation with clinical thought leaders in AID research. In our market research, a predictive low glucose suspend algorithm was reported as the most valuable AID feature among people with insulin-dependent diabetes and their healthcare providers. 
 
In January 2018, we completed a pivotal study for our t:slim X2 with Basal IQ technology. Results from this study, which were published in the Diabetes Care medical journal, showed that the system achieved the primary outcome of reducing time spent in hypoglycemia compared to SAP therapy alone. This reduction was accomplished without any increase in the rate of hyperglycemia. Study participants reported that the system was easy to use and also reported a high level of confidence using the system. 
 
The t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology received FDA approval in June 2018 and launched domestically in August 2018. Concurrent with approval, the t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology was also deemed compatible with approved iCGM devices. Currently, the Dexcom G6 CGM is the only iCGM-designated device in the United States; however, we expect this interoperability designation will streamline the regulatory pathway for integration of the t:slim X2 with future iCGM products as they are approved by the FDA. Interoperability with iCGM devices will still require development effort and business agreements; however, the regulatory process can be lengthy and unpredictable, so we believe this designation, together with the FDA’s recent designation of the t:slim X2 as an ACE pump, may reduce the overall timeline to commercialize interoperable devices.
 
We anticipate offering t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology in select international markets during 2019. Our ability to offer the t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology will depend on several factors, including the availability of Dexcom G6 CGM in the relevant geography. 
 
300-unit Insulin Cartridge being inserted into a t:slim X2 pump 
 
t:slim X2 with G5 Integration 
 
Outside of the United States, we offer the t:slim X2 with G5 integration. The t:slim X2 with G5 integration incorporates the same pump technology and user interface as t:slim X2, but also provides the added convenience of allowing CGM information to be displayed on the pump, thereby eliminating the need to carry an additional device. Based on this information, users are able to utilize the pump to take direct action with their insulin pump therapy. 
 
We believe that our AID and CGM integration advancements, together with future anticipated applications and the global availability of the Tandem Device Updater, will continue to enable users to add significant new features and functionality to their pumps independent of their typical four-year insurance pump replacement cycle.

Our Complementary Products
 
Tandem Device Updater
 
The t:slim X2 is compatible with the Tandem Device Updater, a revolutionary tool that allows pump users to update their pumps’ software quickly and easily from a personal computer. The Tandem Device Updater was cleared by the FDA in the third quarter of 2016 and is PC- and Mac- compatible. It is currently only available in the United States.  
 
The Tandem Device Updater was designed to work with the t:slim X2 in a manner similar to software updates on a smartphone. Because remote updatability for insulin pump software is a unique feature not available in competitive pump offerings, the Tandem Device Updater provides our customers with the capability to access new and enhanced features and functionality faster than the industry has been able to in the past. We are uniquely positioned to offer this capability due to the intuitive software architecture and convenient micro-USB connection included within the t:slim X2.
 
We have launched three different software updates using the Tandem Device Updater. The first was a deployment of updated t:slim software to in-warranty t:slim pumps purchased before April 2015. Next, in September 2017, we set a new standard of care in our industry by offering all existing in-warranty t:slim X2 customers integration with the Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM system through a software update using the Tandem Device Updater. Most recently, we offered all existing in-warranty t:slim X2 customers access to Basal-IQ technology, following their procurement of a prescription and completion of training. We estimate that approximately 40% of our domestic t:slim X2 customers use integrated Dexcom CGM, and about half of those customers have updated their pump to allow use of our Basal-IQ technology. We anticipate that there will be continued adoption of Basal-IQ technology as more people adopt CGM use and with the increasing availability of Dexcom G6 sensors.
 
Historically, we have made all software updates through the Tandem Device Updater available for no cost to in-warranty users. In the future, this tool has the potential to enable users to add other new features and functionality to their pumps, such as new AID algorithms, independent of the typical four-year insurance pump replacement cycle. We expect that future software upgrades will be implemented through our Tandem Device Updater. Although our reimbursement strategy may vary by product and geography, in the future we may seek to secure additional reimbursement for software updates and or charge for updates as we obtain regulatory approval for their commercialization. We also plan to complete the required development work and submit for the necessary regulatory approvals to offer the Tandem Device Updater outside of the United States beginning in 2019.
 
t:connect Diabetes Management Application 
 
We commercially introduced the t:connect Diabetes Management Application, or t:connect, our web-based data management application, in the United States in the first quarter of 2013. It provides users, their caregivers and their healthcare providers a fast, easy and visual way to display diabetes therapy management data from our pumps and supported blood glucose meters. This application empowers people with diabetes, as well as their caregivers and healthcare providers, to quickly and easily identify meaningful insights and trends, allowing them to refine therapy and lifestyle choices for better management of their diabetes. It also provides us with valuable data that we can analyze computationally to reveal patterns, trends and associations that can be used in continuous product improvements, and identification of clinical outcomes data. We also believe t:connect can serve as a key component of mobile health applications that are currently under development. 
 
We developed t:connect to be intuitive by using the same consumer-focused approach utilized in the development of our insulin pumps. It features built-in logic that manages duplicate blood glucose readings from a user’s pump and blood glucose meter to ensure report accuracy. t:connect can also generate color-coded graphs and interactive, multi-dimensional reports that make it easy to identify therapy management trends, problems and successes.
 
In 2017, we launched t:connect HCP, which is an enhanced version of t:connect that we expect will simplify the ability of pump users to share t:connect data with their healthcare providers. This application allows healthcare providers to establish a separate account that centralizes t:connect data from all of their enrolled patients. t:connect and t:connect HCP are not currently available to users or healthcare providers outside the United States.

t:connect Diabetes Management Application 
 
Infusion Sets
 
In September 2017, we began replacing the standard Luer-lok connector that previously joined an infusion set to our cartridge with a custom connector, the t:lock connector. Our t:lock is similar in its design to that of a standard Luer connector, but on average, reduces the time required to fill tubing by more than 30 seconds and reduces the amount of insulin used in the process by 4.5 units. It also reduces the possibility of air bubbles being trapped in the connector. The transition to our t:lock connector resulted in a substantial increase in our sales of infusion sets beginning in the third quarter of 2017. By the end of 2017, our infusion sets and cartridges were being sold on a one-to-one basis. This trend continued in 2018 and is expected for the long-term. We intend to continue to identify solutions that will enhance our infusion set products to address the perceived shortcomings of existing products on the market.
Pump Accessories
 
We offer our customers a broad range of accessories for their pumps, such as cases and belt clips, allowing users to customize their device to their individual lifestyle and sense of style. We believe our accessories increase user flexibility and willingness to use and carry their insulin pump. 
Products under Development 
 
Our products under development support our strategy of focusing on both consumer and clinical needs, and include new AID systems, a next-generation hardware platform, and connected (mobile) health offerings. We intend to leverage our consumer-focused approach and proprietary technology platform to continue to develop products that have the features and functionalities that will allow us to meet the needs of people in differentiated segments of the insulin-dependent diabetes market. 
 
t:slim X2 with Control IQ Technology
 
Our second-generation AID system, the t:slim X2 with Control-IQ technology, is expected to integrate the t:slim X2 with technology that we licensed from TypeZero and Dexcom’s G6 CGM sensor. The iCGM designation for the system also provides the opportunity for integration development efforts with future iCGM sensors that may become available in the market. With our implementation of TypeZero’s inControl AID algorithms, our product is intended to both increase and decrease basal insulin based on a user’s predicted blood glucose levels from a compatible iCGM sensor, as well as deliver automated correction boluses. In conjunction with Dexcom and TypeZero, which was acquired by Dexcom in August 2018, we have integrated our technologies into the U.S. portion of the Clinical Acceptance of the Artificial Pancreas, or DCLP3, portion of the International Diabetes Closed Loop, or the IDCL, trial. Enrollment for the 6-month study was completed in October 2018. Our t:slim X2 with Control-IQ technology has also been evaluated in several early pediatric studies and we intend to support a pivotal study among pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes that will commence in the first half of 2019. Our goal is to commence commercial sales of the t:slim X2 with Control-IQ technology in the United States in the second half of 2019, followed by an international launch in 2020.

t:slim X2 with Control IQ Technology
 
t:sport Insulin Delivery System: Our Next-generation Hardware Platform
 
Our next-generation hardware platform is referred to under its development name, the t:sport insulin delivery system, or t:sport. This product is expected to be half the size of t:slim and is being designed for people who seek even greater discretion and flexibility with the use of their insulin pump. We anticipate that t:sport will feature a 200-unit cartridge, an on-pump bolus button, a rechargeable battery, an AID algorithm, and a Bluetooth radio. t:sport is being designed for use with leading U-100 insulins, and we are evaluating the use of insulin concentrates to provide people with greater insulin needs. t:sport will utilize a pumping mechanism that differs from our current Micro-Delivery technology.
 
t:sport Shown with Touchscreen Controller
 
Since 2016, we have engaged in discussions with the FDA regarding whether the t:sport controller can be implemented as a mobile device application or will need to be a separate device. Based on the FDA’s feedback regarding the use of unrestricted mobile phones, we are designing the product so that it will have the technical capability to be controlled using either a dedicated controller or a mobile device. Because of the nature of our touchscreen user interface, we are well positioned to pursue either option.
 
We anticipate pursuing FDA authorization for t:sport as an ACE pump, and we are designing t:sport to be compatible with our AID algorithms and any available iCGM. Our goal is to receive FDA authorization for this product for use in the United States in 2020, and to thereafter submit for regulatory approvals outside the United States. 
 
20

Connected (Mobile) Health Offerings
 
We are currently developing a mobile application that is being designed to utilize the capability of the Bluetooth radio to wirelessly upload pump data to t:connect, receive notification of pump alerts and alarms, integrate other health-related information from third party sources, and support future pump-control capabilities for our products under development. Subject to FDA approval, we intend to launch the first generation of our mobile application with a subset of these features in the United States in 2019. 
 

Mobile Application 
 

Sales and Marketing 
 
Our sales and marketing objectives are to:
 
 
• | generate demand and acceptance for our product offerings developed using our technology platform among people with insulin-dependent diabetes; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | promote advocacy and support for our products and brands with healthcare providers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 70 territories in our U.S. sales organization, with approximately 200 full-time employees on our sales, clinical and marketing team. The vast majority of territories are supported by a territory manager and a clinical diabetes specialist who, as a team, call on domestic endocrinologists, nurse practitioners, primary care physicians, certified diabetes educators and potential customers. Where appropriate, some territories are supported by multiple clinical diabetes specialists. Our U.S. sales team is augmented by individuals in our internal customer sales support organization, who follow up on leads generated through promotional activities and educate people on the benefits of our proprietary technology and products.
 
Our internal San Diego-based customer sales support organization also contacts existing customers who are approaching their insurance renewal date to aid in the renewal process. Our goal is for at least 70% of our existing customers to purchase a new pump from us when making their next pump purchasing decision. Typically, domestic customers are eligible for insurance reimbursement to purchase a new insulin pump once every four years; however, some plans may be limited to once every five years or have additional restrictions or requirements. Insurance reimbursement processes outside the United States vary by geography. 2017 was our first full year with customers eligible for renewal. Renewal sales to existing customers nearly doubled between 2017 and 2018. Factors such as the timing of competitive product launches, regulatory approvals, advancements in diabetes therapy alternatives, insurance eligibility and other market dynamics may impact the rate of renewal purchases in the future.
 
21

As our market penetration continues to build momentum, and as we launch new products into the market, we plan to further expand our sales, clinical and marketing infrastructure in the United States. However, only modest territory optimizations and expansions are anticipated in 2019. 
 
In Canada, in the second half of 2018 we established a small direct sales and clinical infrastructure. We also intend to use a local distributor for select order processing and fulfillment services as needed. In October 2018, we received approval from Health Canada to begin marketing the t:slim X2 with G5 integration and commenced marketing and sales efforts. We also began the process of securing reimbursement in each of the provinces, which we expect to continue in 2019. 
 
In other select geographies outside the United States, our efforts have primarily focused on the identification and contracting of distributors in areas where we believe there is a meaningful opportunity for our t:slim X2 insulin pump. Unlike our domestic operations, our international distributors other than in Canada will have substantially greater responsibility for sales, marketing and customer support efforts. Our existing international distributors cover several geographies, including: Australia, Italy, New Zealand, Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway and Sweden), South Africa, Spain, and the United Kingdom. 
 
We began attending prominent international diabetes tradeshows in early 2018 and obtained the right to affix the CE Mark to the t:slim X2 with G5 integration in April 2018. We began our scaled launch in the third quarter of 2018 following the completion of pre-launch activities, such as translating both our pump software and user manual, and distributor sales and customer service trainings. We anticipate continuing to expand our commercial efforts outside the United States throughout 2019, which may include expanding our sales to additional select geographies and contracting with additional international distributors.
 
Revenue Concentrations and Significant Customers. A small number of independent domestic distributors have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we made sales to approximately 55 independent distributors in the United States, and nine independent distributors internationally. In fiscal 2018, sales to Edgepark Medical Supplies, Inc. and Byram Healthcare accounted for 19.4% and 15.6% of consolidated sales, respectively. In fiscal 2017, Edgepark Medical Supplies, Inc. and Byram Healthcare accounted for 21.5% and 14.0% of our sales, respectively. In fiscal 2016, Edgepark Medical Supplies, Inc. and Byram Healthcare accounted for 18.7% and 14.0% of our sales, respectively. None of our independent distributors in the United States are required to sell our products exclusively and each of them may freely sell the products of our competitors. Our distributor agreements in the United States generally have one-year initial terms with automatic one-year renewal terms and are terminable in connection with a party’s material breach. Our distributor agreements outside the United States generally have longer initial terms and, in addition to being terminable in connection with a party’s material breach, include provisions that allow us to terminate those agreements prior to their ordinary expiration in exceptional circumstances. We believe both our domestic and international distributors carry minimal inventory at any given time. 
 
Healthcare provider focused initiatives. Healthcare providers are a critical resource in helping patients understand and select their diabetes therapy options. Each of our territories in the United States and many of our territories in Canada are supported by a clinical diabetes specialist who is a certified diabetes educator and holds either a registered nurse or registered dietician license. Our clinical diabetes specialists support and educate healthcare providers on our products and proprietary technology, certify healthcare providers to train people to use our products and support our customers with initial training following the purchase of our products. We have also established a network of independent, licensed diabetes educators who have been certified to train on our products and will conduct customer training on our behalf. 
 
In addition to calling on healthcare providers in their offices, some of our recent marketing initiatives include: 
 
 
● | presentations and product demonstrations at local, regional, national and international tradeshows, including the American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions and the American Association of Diabetes Educators Annual Meeting, Diabetes Canada and Advanced Technologies and Treatment for Diabetes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our Demonstration Unit Program, through which we provide healthcare professionals with our products, or a mobile device that operates our t:simulator App, for pump demonstrations to their patients; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | business relationships with third-party diabetes management applications, such as Glooko, for the display of Tandem pump data.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Consumer-focused initiatives. We sell our products directly to consumers through referrals from healthcare providers and through leads generated through our promotional activities. Our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts focus on positioning our products as innovative, consumer-focused insulin pumps with a unique Micro-Delivery technology, slim touchscreen design, and an intuitive user interface designed to meet different needs in the diabetes community. In connection with the domestic launch of t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology, our marketing also educates consumers and healthcare providers on the benefit of our AID algorithm, and the Dexcom G6 as a more accurate sensor that does not require fingersticks compared to competitive products. Some of our recent consumer-focused marketing initiatives include:

Branding. We developed our comprehensive branding strategy to engage consumers and communicate our identity as a modern and progressive company that works “in tandem” with the diabetes community, healthcare providers, our employees and business partners. We strive to embody this through our product offerings, marketing efforts and interactions throughout our business. Our product names are consistently branded using a “t:” to create uniformity and help consumers quickly identify our products. In the United States, our “pump that gets updated, not outdated” marketing campaign highlights that we are able to offer customers the ability to remotely update or add features on their in-warranty insulin pump. Our other product packaging, website, advertising and promotional materials are a reflection of our consumer-focused approach and modern style. We value having clear, friendly and helpful communications throughout our business. 
 
Animas Transition
 
In October 2017, Johnson & Johnson announced that it was discontinuing the operations of Animas, and exiting the insulin pump business entirely, and, in connection with these activities, designated Medtronic as a preferred partner to facilitate the transition of Animas insulin pump customers. Animas supply ordering and support was transitioned to Medtronic as of April 2018. Medtronic is offering a portion of Animas customers the option of acquiring a Medtronic insulin pump at no charge. As a result of this change in the insulin pump market, we now offer the only alternative durable insulin pump to Medtronic in the United States. Nevertheless, a large percentage of our new customers still report being new to pump therapy, with approximately half converting from MDI, followed by customers who reported converting from either a Medtronic or Animas pump. However, throughout 2018 we experienced an increase in our percentage of sales to people who reported converting from using an Animas pump. The longer-term impact on our business of Animas’ exit may be dependent on one or more of the following factors: 

● | The offer to Animas customers for a free Medtronic pump is currently limited to customers with a warranty expiration date later than September 30, 2019. It remains uncertain how many Animas customers will avail themselves of this offer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | While Medtronic will have direct access to all Animas customers during the transition period, as those customers' pumps come up for renewal and they make new pump purchasing decisions, they may consider alternative pump options. Our own customer data and other available market research shows a high number of customers converting to our products from an Animas pump, and we believe our pumps are an attractive alternative to both Animas and Medtronic pumps.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We believe one of the product features that has made Animas pumps attractive to their customers is the integration of the Animas Vibe with Dexcom’s CGM technology. We now provide the only commercially available pump that is integrated with Dexcom’s technology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The opportunity for our international distributors to convert current Animas customers to a Tandem pump. Unlike in the United States, many of our international distributors have existing relationships with Animas customers and will be motivated to keep those individuals as existing customers by replacing Animas pumps with our t:slim X2 as opportunities arise.

Training and Customer Care 
 
Given the chronic nature of diabetes, and the potentially complicated dynamic of health insurance coverage, training and customer care is important for developing long-term relationships with our customers. Our customer care infrastructure, which services the United States and Canada, consists of individuals focused on training, technical services and insurance verification. We provide training to our distribution partners who fulfill these responsibilities outside the United States. We believe our consumer-focused approach enables us to develop a personal relationship with the customer, or potential customer, beginning with the process of evaluating our products, then navigating insurance coverage and extending to our provision of training and ongoing support. Providing reliable and effective ongoing customer support reduces anxiety, improves our customers’ overall experiences with our products and helps reinforce our positive reputation in the diabetes community. In order to provide complete training and customer care solutions, we leverage the expertise of our clinical diabetes specialists in the Unites States and Canada who provide one-on-one training, and we offer ongoing complementary technical services, as well as ongoing support with insurance verification. 
Training. Our research has shown that it can take several days for a user to competently learn how to use a traditional pump, leading to frustration, frequent mistakes and additional training, each of which may ultimately discourage adoption. As a result, we believe that healthcare providers may be less likely to recommend pump therapy to potential candidates. 
 
By offering an intuitive user interface, we believe healthcare providers will be able to train people to use our products more efficiently than traditional pumps, and will have a higher degree of confidence in their patients’ ability to operate it, including the more advanced features. For example, the addition of Basal-IQ technology to our t:slim X2 only added one new screen to our user interface. In addition, the intuitive nature of our pump products likely will allow healthcare providers to spend less time teaching a person how to use their pump and more time helping to improve the management of their diabetes. This ease of training may also help users feel less intimidated and fearful of pump therapy, leading to increased adoption and market expansion. 
 
We tailor our training efforts for insulin pump users and healthcare providers. In some cases, our clinical training managers may certify clinic-based healthcare providers to train their patients on our products. In other cases, a member of our clinical team will conduct one-on-one training on our products with the customer. We have also established a network of independent, licensed diabetes educators who have been certified to train on our products and will conduct customer training on our behalf.
 
For our customers who purchased t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology, we offer online training on the use of the AID algorithm and CGM components of the system. Customers can access one or more modules of the training system at their own pace and at their preferred location, which offers them a convenient method to access the latest training available. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we presented research demonstrating the ease-of-use and effectiveness of computer-based training from the human factors study of the t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology. The study demonstrated a 99% success rate among study participants who performed a series of critical tasks using the system after initial training. Out of 530 tasks performed, only seven task failures were observed, none of which related to safety. In addition, participants in the t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology pivotal study reported that the system is easy to use and also reported a high level of confidence using the system. We believe the ease of training on the t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology is a competitive advantage compared to currently-available AID systems.
 
Technical Services. We believe that a difficult-to-use pump will result in users making more frequent calls to the pump manufacturer or their healthcare provider for support in using the device. This can be frustrating for the customer and costly for the pump manufacturer as well as for the healthcare provider. In general, we expect the intuitive nature of our products to result in fewer calls from users requesting support from our technical services team or their healthcare provider. However, because of the significant percentage of our customers who are new to pump therapy, we also anticipate receiving high call volume from customers who are still becoming familiar with the fundamentals of insulin pump therapy. In addition, we have experienced increases to our call volume as our existing customers begin to utilize CGM integration with their t:slim X2, and begin using our AID algorithm. We anticipate experiencing a similar dynamic in the future as we launch new AID systems and new product offerings. 
 
Our customer-focused technical services team provides support to U.S.- and Canadian-based customers seven days a week, 24 hours a day by answering questions, troubleshooting and addressing issues or concerns about the pump, CGM and algorithm components of our systems. In 2018, we began investing in technology solutions to improve the customer’s experience calling into our call center, and improve efficiencies of our internal support infrastructure. We anticipate continuing to invest in this area in 2019, while further leveraging our infrastructure. Our insulin pump products are typically covered by a four-year warranty. The warranty includes our product replacement program, which allows our technical services team members to provide a customer with a replacement device within as little as 24 hours, to minimize the interruption of his or her therapy. We also coordinate product replacements of CGM components where appropriate.
 24


Internationally, our distribution partners provide technical services support to their t:slim X2 customers.  
 
Insurance Verification. Our insurance verification team provides support to U.S. and Canadian based customers, and potential customers, understand their insurance benefits. We work with the customers and their healthcare providers to collect information required by the insurance provider and to determine their insurance benefit coverage for our products and notify them of their benefit. 
 
Following communication of a person’s estimated financial responsibility, final confirmation of their desire to purchase the device and method of fulfillment, the customer’s order is typically shipped to their home. The initial order generally contains their insulin pump as well as a 90-day supply of infusion sets and cartridges. For customers that we service on a direct basis, a member of our internal team then contacts the customer prior to the end of their 90-day supply to re-verify their insurance benefits and assist in reordering supplies. For customers who purchase our insulin pump through one of our authorized U.S. or international distributors, ongoing supplies are typically also arranged through the distributor.
 
Third-Party Reimbursement 
 
In the United States, customer orders are typically fulfilled by billing third-party payors on behalf of our customers, or by utilizing our network of distributors who then bill third-party payors on our customers’ behalf. Our fulfillment and reimbursement systems are fully integrated such that our products are shipped only after receipt of a valid physician’s order and verification of current health insurance information. 
 
We are accredited by the Community Health Accreditation Program and are an approved Medicare provider. Domestically, we primarily bill for our insulin pump products and associated supplies using existing Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes for which Medicare reimbursement is well established. However, pump eligibility criteria for people with type 2 diabetes can be different and often requires additional documentation and laboratory testing to gain in-network insurance reimbursement benefits.
 
Over the last ten years, Medicare reimbursement rates for insulin pumps and disposable cartridges have remained relatively unchanged. However, Medicare periodically reviews its reimbursement practices for diabetes-related products. In 2010, Medicare implemented a competitive bidding process for blood glucose strip reimbursement, which resulted in a significant reduction in the reimbursement rate for those products. More recently, in 2017, Medicare announced, and then shortly thereafter suspended, a competitive bidding process for insulin pumps. As a result, there is some uncertainty as to the future Medicare reimbursement rate for our current and future products. 
 
We enter into contracts with national and regional third-party payors to establish reimbursement for our insulin pump products, disposable cartridges and other related supplies. We employ a team of managed care managers who are responsible for negotiating and securing contracts with third-party payors throughout the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 20% of our shipments were generated through our direct third-party payor contracts.
 
If we are not contracted with a person’s third-party payor and in-network status cannot be otherwise obtained, then to the extent possible we utilize distribution channels so our customers’ orders can be serviced. As of December 31, 2018, we had executed distributor agreements with approximately 55 independent distributors. In some cases, but not all, this network of distributors allows us to access people who are covered by commercial payors with whom we are not contracted, at in-network rates that are generally more affordable for our customers. However, UnitedHealthcare designated one of our competitors as their preferred, in-network durable medical equipment provider of insulin pumps for most customers over seven years of age. We expect this decision will prevent a majority of UnitedHealthcare members from purchasing our insulin pump for the foreseeable future, whether directly from us or through our network of distributors.
 
Our distribution partners outside the United States and Canada are responsible for all reimbursement, tender application and fulfillment activities. 
 
Manufacturing and Quality Assurance 
 
We currently manufacture our products at our facility in San Diego, California. In 2017, we transitioned our manufacturing operations to a new facility located on Barnes Canyon Road in San Diego, California, which became fully operational at the beginning of 2018. This facility doubled our manufacturing capacity for insulin pumps and cartridges, expanded warehousing for additional infusion set supplies, and provided additional production capacity for new products under development, without significantly increasing the cost of overhead associated with our manufacturing facilities. 
 
25

The Barnes Canyon facility is designed to optimize our manufacturing processes and allow for greater operational efficiencies, which we believe positions us well to achieve our long-term gross margin targets. By maintaining close proximity to our other business functions, we believe we will enhance our ability to monitor and manage our manufacturing processes, and to adjust manufacturing operations quickly in response to our business needs. The transition to the new manufacturing facility took place primarily in the second half of 2017, during which time we experienced some temporary duplication of operations to support ongoing product requirements, as well as some incremental manufacturing costs. In 2018, we did not make significant capital expenditures in our manufacturing operations. In 2019, we anticipate making capital expenditures in the purchase of an additional manufacturing equipment and to expand our warehousing capacity.
 
We currently utilize a semi-automated manufacturing process for our pump products and disposable cartridges. The pump production line requires approximately 20 manufacturing assemblers and limited support staff to run the line, and reaches a maximum output of approximately 30,000 pumps per year on a single shift. We currently have two pump manufacturing lines that have capacity to produce 110,000 pumps annually. Disposable cartridges are manufactured on a production line that requires 10 manufacturing operators and limited support staff, and reaches a maximum output of approximately one million cartridges per year on a single shift. We currently have four cartridge manufacturing lines that provide capacity to build 12 million units annually, which we believe can support an installed customer base of approximately 100,000 customers. We also have capacity to add two additional lines in our current facility which will provide approximately six million cartridges annually, to supporting an additional 50,000 customers. We continue to improve the efficiency of our disposable cartridge manufacturing process. 
 
The cartridge automation equipment is designed to operate at capacity. As such, the line is constructed in several modular sections that perform different aspects of the assembly. This is important because at any given time, maintenance, service or inspection can be performed on any one section independent of the rest of the line. The manufacturing process may then continue uninterrupted while the assembly step is performed manually until the automation section is back on-line.
 
Outside suppliers are the source for most of the components and some sub-assemblies in the production of our insulin pumps. Typically, our outside vendors produce components to our specifications and in many instances to our designs. Any sole and single source supplier is managed through our supplier management program that is focused on reducing supply chain risk. Key aspects of this program include managing component inventory in house and at the supplier, contractual requirements for last time buy opportunities and second sourcing approaches for specific suppliers. Due to the rapid increase in demand for our products over the past 12 months, we have not maintained our desired inventory levels for certain key pump components, which has limited our production capacity. Accordingly, during 2019 we intend to substantially increase our ongoing purchases of key components and sub-assemblies to produce our insulin pump products and make corresponding increases for our warehousing capacity of both raw materials and finished goods. 
 
Our suppliers are evaluated, approved and monitored periodically by our quality department to ensure conformity with the specifications, policies and procedures for our devices. Members of our quality department also inspect our devices at various steps during the manufacturing cycle to facilitate compliance with our devices’ stringent specifications. 
 
We have received certification from BSI Group, a Notified Body to the International Standards Organization, or ISO, of our quality system. This ISO 13485 certification now extends to our new manufacturing facility on Barnes Canyon Road. Certain processes utilized in the manufacturing and testing of our devices have been verified and validated as required by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facility and the facilities of our sterilization and other critical suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and certain corresponding state agencies. 
 
Research and Development 
 
Our research and development team includes employees who specialize in software engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, fluid dynamics, mobile connectivity and graphical user interface design, many of whom have considerable experience in diabetes-related products. Our research and development team focuses on the continuous improvement and support of current product offerings, as well as our products under development. 
 
In June 2015, we entered into non-exclusive agreements with Dexcom to allow the integration of our insulin pump products with the Dexcom G5 and G6 CGM systems worldwide. Each agreement has an initial term of five years, and thereafter renew automatically for additional one-year terms unless either party provides advance notice to the other party that they do not wish to extend the agreement. The agreements do not require any licensing fees, milestone payments or royalty obligations to Dexcom. The agreements contain customary provisions for termination in the event of an uncured material breach or in the event of a dissolution of the other party, and prohibit our assignment of the agreements to a Dexcom competitor without Dexcom’s prior consent. 
 
26

In 2016, we entered into a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license agreement with TypeZero to allow the integration of our insulin pump products with TypeZero’s inControl AID technology. The agreement also provides us access to TypeZero’s future AID innovations for five years following the date of the agreement. In addition, the license agreement contemplates that our insulin pump products will be used alongside TypeZero’s AID technology in the IDCL Trial. In August 2018, TypeZero was acquired by Dexcom. Nevertheless, the terms of our agreement with TypeZero remain effective until the patents covered by the agreement have expired, subject to customary provisions for termination in the event of an uncured material breach. 
 
Intellectual Property 
 
We have made protection of our intellectual property a strategic priority. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights. 
 
As of December 31, 2018, our patent portfolio consisted of approximately 68 issued U.S. patents and 68 pending U.S. patent applications. Of these, our issued U.S. patents expire between approximately 2021 and 2036. We are also seeking patent protection for our proprietary technology in other countries throughout the world. In addition, we also have 23 trademark registrations, including 10 U.S. trademark registrations and 13 foreign trademark registrations.
 
In July 2012, we entered into an agreement with Smiths Medical, Inc., or Smiths Medical, pursuant to which we were granted, through certain assignments and certain non-exclusive and exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty-free licenses, certain rights to patents and patent applications related to ambulatory infusion pumps and related software and accessories for the treatment of diabetes. We agreed to pay $5.0 million in license fees and to share equally any associated sublicense revenues we may receive. As of December 31, 2018, we had paid the initial license fees in full and have not entered into any sublicense agreements. 
 
Competition 
 
The medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to the introduction of new products, treatment techniques or technologies, or other market activities of industry participants. We compete in domestic and international markets with a number of companies that manufacture insulin delivery devices, such as Medtronic MiniMed, a division of Medtronic, and Insulet Corporation. However, the market for insulin pumps recently underwent significant changes. For instance, in late 2016, Roche Diabetes Care, a division of F. Hoffman-La Roche, discontinued sales of new insulin pumps in the United States. Roche continues to sell and market its insulin pump products in international markets. In October 2017, Johnson & Johnson announced that it was discontinuing the operations of Animas and exiting the insulin pump business entirely, and designated Medtronic as a preferred partner to facilitate the transition of Animas insulin pump customers. Also, in late 2017, Eli Lilly & Co. announced that it was developing an insulin pump with AID technology and Becton Dickinson recently confirmed that it intends to launch an insulin pump designed for people with type 2 diabetes in 2019. However, it is difficult to predict the potential impact of these changes on our competitive landscape. There are also several other companies that are currently marketing insulin pump products in international markets.
 
Our current primary competitors are either publicly traded companies or divisions or subsidiaries of publicly traded companies. These companies have several competitive advantages over us, including greater financial resources for sales and marketing and product development, established relationships with healthcare providers and third-party payors, and larger and more established distribution networks. In some instances, our competitors also offer products that include features that we do not currently offer. For instance, Insulet offers an insulin pump with a tubeless delivery system that does not utilize an infusion set, and Medtronic offers a traditional insulin pump that is integrated with a CGM system featuring a hybrid closed-loop AID algorithm. 
 
In addition, we face competition from a number of companies, medical researchers and existing pharmaceutical companies that are pursuing new delivery devices, delivery technologies, sensing technologies, procedures, drugs and other therapeutics for the monitoring, treatment and prevention of diabetes.

Government Regulation
 
Our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States, corresponding state regulatory authorities and other regulatory bodies in other countries. The U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and the FDA’s implementing regulations govern: 
 
 
• | product design and development;
--+--------------------------------


• | pre-clinical and clinical testing;
--+-----------------------------------


• | establishment registration and product listing;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | product manufacturing;
--+-----------------------


• | labeling and storage;
--+----------------------


• | pre-market clearance or approval; advertising and promotion;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | product sales and distribution;
--+--------------------------------


• | recalls and field safety corrective actions; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | servicing and post-market surveillance.
--+----------------------------------------

 
FDA’s Pre-Market Clearance and Approval Requirements. Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a pre-market notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA through the Premarket Approval, or PMA, process. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be expensive, lengthy and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available. 
 
The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which cover manufacturers’ methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of products. Class II devices are subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines, or particularized labeling, as well as general controls. Some Class I and Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement, and the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR. t:slim, t:flex, t:slim X2 and t:connect received FDA clearance as Class II devices. However, t:connect was subsequently down-classified to a Class I device. A PMA application is required for devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or certain implantable devices, or those that are “not substantially equivalent” either to a device previously cleared through the 510(k) process or to a “preamendment” Class III device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 when PMA applications were not required. t:slim G4 and t:slim X2 with Dexcom’s G5 sensor integration, and t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology received FDA approval as a Class III device. 
 
Our t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology was the first insulin pump to receive approval for iCGM compatibility, a new interoperability designation for integrated iCGM devices. Similarly, as part of the FDA’s interoperability initiative, in February 2019, we received FDA approval of our De Novo application to down-classify the t:slim X2 to a Class II device, under the new insulin pump classification referred to as ACE pumps. This classification, as well as the iCGM classification, are intended to help streamline the regulatory pathway for integrated products approved by the FDA. However, we anticipate that the software component of our products related to AID features, such as our Basal-IQ technology and our Control-IQ technology currently in development, will continue to be subject to review by the FDA under the class III PMA device standards.
 
A PMA application must be supported by valid scientific evidence that typically includes extensive technical, pre-clinical, clinical, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device. A PMA application also must include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling. After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to evaluate compliance with QSR, which requires manufacturers to implement and follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. 
 28


FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including: 
 
 
• | systems may not be safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If an FDA evaluation of a PMA application is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of a device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing. 
 
New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. 
 
Clinical trials are typically required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. The FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward, but it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA’s regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 
 
• | the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients do not comply with trial protocols;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | patient follow-up is not at the rate expected;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | patients experience adverse side effects;
--+------------------------------------------


• | patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of our trial;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 29


 
• | third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices or other FDA requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we or third-party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to us or our study that the FDA deems to make the study results unreliable, or the company or investigators fail to disclose such interests;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA concludes that our trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Regulatory Requirements. Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: 
 
 
• | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations that prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses, and impose other restrictions on labeling, advertising and promotion;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA’s Medical Device Reporting, or MDR regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | voluntary and mandatory device recalls to address problems when a device is defective and could be a risk to health; and

Also, the FDA may require us to conduct post-market surveillance studies or establish and maintain a system for tracking our products through the chain of distribution to the patient level. The FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services enforce regulatory requirements by conducting periodic, unannounced inspections and market surveillance. Inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. 
 
In general, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. These may include any of the following sanctions or consequences:

We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers and some suppliers of components or device accessories, are required to manufacture our products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and it includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers, or regulated suppliers, are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. 
 
Licensure. In the United States, several states require that durable medical equipment, or DME, providers be licensed in order to sell products to patients in that state. Some of these states require that DME providers maintain an in-state location or retain a licensed pharmacist, and in those states, we sell our products through a third-party distributor. Although we believe we are in material compliance with applicable state regulations regarding licensure requirements, if we were found to be noncompliant, we could be subject to fines and penalties or lose our licensure in that state, which could prohibit us from selling our current or future products to patients in that state. In addition, we are subject to certain state laws regarding professional licensure. We believe that our certified diabetes educators are in material compliance with such state laws. However, if our educators or we were to be found non-compliant in a given state, we may need to modify our approach to providing education, clinical support and customer service. 
Fraud and Abuse Laws. There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the Physician Self-Referral Law, or the Stark Law, the federal civil False Claims Acts, the federal criminal Health Care Fraud Statute, as well as various state laws regulating healthcare. Our relationships with healthcare providers and other third parties are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. 
Federal Anti-Kickback Statue. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid.
 
We provide the initial training to customers necessary for appropriate use of our products either through our own diabetes educators or by contracting with outside diabetes educators who have completed a Tandem pump-training course. Outside diabetes educators are reimbursed for their services at fair market value. Although we believe that these arrangements do not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute, regulatory authorities may determine otherwise, especially as enforcement of this law historically has been a high priority for the federal government. Noncompliance with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute could result in our exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs (which could adversely affect our revenues to a material extent), restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, and civil and criminal penalties.
 
Physician Self-Referral Law. The Stark Law prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services,” including a company that furnishes durable medical equipment, if the physician has a financial relationship with the company. In addition to statutory exceptions, CMS has issued numerous regulatory exceptions to the Stark Law. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliant arrangement, civil penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Although we believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to comply with current Stark Law requirements, these arrangements may not expressly meet the requirements for applicable exception from the law.

Federal False Claims Act. The federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits under the act. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines and/or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action.
 
We submit reimbursement claims to federal healthcare programs, and we also may provide some coding and billing information to purchasers of our devices. These activities, if inappropriate, could result in liability under the False Claims Act. Further, claims arising from relationships which violate the Anti-Kickback Statute are considered to be false claims under the False Claims Act. Liability under the False Claims Act may also attach to claims arising from financial relationships which violate the Stark Law. We believe that we currently are in material compliance with the federal government’s laws and regulations concerning the submission of claims and the provision of coding and billing information. However, because we cannot guarantee that the government or qui tam relators will regard any billing errors that may be made as inadvertent, or our provider relationships as compliant, we may have exposure under the False Claims Act.
 
Federal Health Care Fraud Statutes. We are also subject to a federal health care fraud statute that, among other things, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program including non-governmental programs, and prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document with knowledge that it contains a materially false or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.
State Fraud and Abuse Provisions. Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and false claims acts. We believe that we are in material conformance to such laws. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions. 
Data Privacy and Information Security Laws and Regulations. t:connect data is hosted on secure servers and our use of t:connect data is subject to internal policies and procedures that are designed to comply with the federal U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as well as applicable U.S state privacy laws (including, but not limited to, the recently passed California’s Consumer Privacy Act). Although t:connect and t:connect HCP are not currently available to users or healthcare providers outside the United States, we are also mindful of requirements under Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, referred to as PIPEDA, and similar Provincial laws; and the EU General Data Protection Regulation, commonly known as GDPR, and similar Member State laws. Collectively, these laws and regulations set standards for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the personal information we collect and use from customers and healthcare providers. These laws also require, among other things, that we are transparent about how we collect and share personal data and that we give t:connect users the ability to know what data we are collecting about them, to obtain a copy of that data, to correct or amend that data, and to request we restrict use of that data.
Healthcare Fraud. In addition to information security and data privacy obligations, HIPAA also created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. We believe we are in substantial compliance with these provisions of HIPAA. 
Physician Payments Sunshine Act. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers, including medical device manufacturers, to submit annual data pertaining to payments or other transfers of value to covered recipients, including physicians. Manufacturers may be subject to audit for their compliance with this law. Failure to submit the required data in an accurate and timely manner may result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties. We believe we are in substantial compliance with the Physician Payments Sunshine Act.
 
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and similar laws in foreign jurisdictions generally prohibit U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments, gifts or transfers to any foreign government official in order to obtain or retain business. The scope of the FCPA would include interactions with certain healthcare professionals and hospital administrators in many countries. We believe we are in substantial compliance with the FCPA and similar foreign regulations.

International Regulation 
 
International sales of medical devices are subject to local government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries. 
 
The primary regulatory body in Europe is that of the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a “Notified Body.” This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s product. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union. Additional local requirements may apply on a country-by-country basis. Outside of the European Union, regulatory approval would need to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market our products. 
 
In April 2018, we obtained the right to affix the CE Mark to the t:slim X2 with G5 integration. The CE Mark gives us authorization to distribute the t:slim X2 throughout the European Union and in other countries that recognize the CE Mark. In October 2018, we received Health Canada approval to distribute the t:slim X2 with G5 integration throughout Canada. In the third quarter of 2018, we began selling the t:slim X2 with G5 integration in select geographies outside the United States through distributors, and our direct sales efforts in Canada began in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 653 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced any work stoppage. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
