Item 1.  Business
GENERAL

White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd. (the “Company” or the “Registrant”) is an exempted Bermuda limited liability company whose principal businesses are conducted through its subsidiaries and affiliates. Within this report, the term “White Mountains” is used to refer to one or more entities within the consolidated organization, as the context requires. The Company’s headquarters is located at 26 Reid Street, Hamilton, Bermuda HM 11, its principal executive office is located at 80 South Main Street, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755-2053 and its registered office is located at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton, Bermuda HM 11. 
White Mountains is engaged in the business of making opportunistic and value-oriented acquisitions of businesses and assets in the insurance, financial services and related sectors, operating these businesses and assets through its subsidiaries and, if and when attractive exit valuations become available, disposing of these businesses and assets.
White Mountains conducts its business primarily in four areas: municipal bond insurance, specialty insurance distribution, marketing technology (for insurance and other verticals) and other operations. White Mountains’s municipal bond insurance business is conducted through its subsidiary HG Global Ltd. and its reinsurance subsidiary HG Re Ltd. (“HG Re”), (collectively, “HG Global”). HG Global was established to fund the startup of and provide reinsurance, through HG Re, to Build America Mutual Assurance Company (“BAM”), a mutual municipal bond insurance company. White Mountains’s specialty insurance distribution business is conducted through its subsidiary NSM Insurance HoldCo, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, “NSM”). White Mountains’s marketing technology business is conducted through its subsidiary QL Holdings LLC and its subsidiary QuoteLab, LLC (collectively “MediaAlpha”). White Mountains’s investing activities are conducted through its investment management subsidiary, White Mountains Advisors LLC (“WM Advisors”). White Mountains’s reportable segments are HG Global/BAM, NSM, MediaAlpha and Other Operations.
White Mountains’s Operating Principles

White Mountains strives to operate within the spirit of four operating principles. These are:

Underwriting Comes First.  An insurance enterprise must respect the fundamentals of insurance. There must be a realistic expectation of underwriting profit on all business written and demonstrated fulfillment of that expectation over time, with focused attention to the loss ratio and to all the professional insurance disciplines of pricing, underwriting and claims management.
Maintain a Disciplined Balance Sheet.  The first concern here is that insurance liabilities must always be fully recognized. Loss reserves and expense reserves must be solid before any other aspect of the business can be solid. Pricing, marketing and underwriting all depend on informed judgment of ultimate loss costs that can be managed effectively only with a disciplined balance sheet.

Invest for Total Return. Historically, the insurance industry has emphasized investment income (interest and dividends) above capital gains. White Mountains invests to maximize total return over time. White Mountains manages its bond portfolios for after-tax total return and also invests prudently in equities.
Think Like Owners. Thinking like owners has a value all its own. There are stakeholders in a business enterprise, and doing good work requires more than this quarter’s profit. Thinking like an owner embraces all of that and is the touchstone of a capitalist enterprise.

HG GLOBAL/BAM
The HG Global/BAM segment consists of the consolidated results of HG Global and BAM. BAM is the first and only mutual municipal bond insurance company in the United States. By insuring the timely payment of principal and interest, BAM provides market access to, and lowers interest expense for, issuers of municipal bonds used to finance essential public purposes. BAM is domiciled in New York and is owned by and operated for the benefit of its policyholders, the municipalities that purchase BAM’s insurance for their debt issuances. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) require White Mountains to consolidate BAM’s results in its financial statements, which are attributed to non-controlling interests. BAM reports on a statutory accounting basis to the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) and does not report stand-alone GAAP financial results.
HG Global was established to fund the startup of BAM and, through HG Re, to provide up to 15%-of-par, first loss reinsurance protection for policies underwritten by BAM. HG Global and HG Re are domiciled in Bermuda.
BAM charges an insurance premium on each municipal bond insurance policy it writes. A portion of the premium is a member’s surplus contribution (“MSC”) and the remainder is a risk premium. In the event of a municipal bond refunding, the MSC from the original issuance can be reutilized, in effect serving as a credit against the total insurance premium on the refunding of the municipal bond. Issuers of debt insured by BAM are members of BAM so long as any of their BAM-insured debt is outstanding, and as members they have certain interests in BAM, including the right to vote for BAM’s directors and to receive dividends, if declared.
BAM focuses on municipal bonds issued to finance essential public purposes, such as schools, utilities and transportation facilities. BAM focuses on small-to-medium sized investment grade municipal bonds, primarily in the AA, A and BBB categories. BAM seeks to build a relatively low risk insurance portfolio with prudent single risk limits. White Mountains believes that municipal bonds insured by BAM have strong appeal to retail investors, who buy smaller, less liquid issues, have less portfolio diversification and have fewer credit differentiation skills and analytical resources than institutional investors. 
BAM launched in July 2012 after securing an “AA/stable” rating from Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“Standard & Poor’s”). In June 2018, Standard & Poor’s affirmed BAM’s “AA/stable” rating. “AA” is the third highest of 23 financial strength ratings assigned by Standard & Poor’s.  
At inception in 2012, HG Global was capitalized with $609 million. HG Global, together with its subsidiaries, funded the initial capitalization of BAM through the purchase of $503 million of surplus notes issued by BAM, consisting of $203 million of Series A Notes and $300 million of Series B Notes (the “BAM Surplus Notes”). See “CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES — Surplus Notes Valuation — BAM Surplus Notes” on page 60 for a discussion on the accounting and risks associated with the BAM Surplus Notes. 
At inception, BAM and HG Re also entered into a first loss reinsurance treaty (“FLRT”). HG Re provides first loss protection up to 15%-of-par outstanding on each municipal bond insured by BAM. For capital appreciation bonds, par is adjusted to the estimated equivalent par value for current interest paying bonds. In return, BAM cedes 60% of the risk premium charged for insuring the municipal bond, net of a ceding commission. 
HG Re’s obligations under the FLRT are limited to the assets in two collateral trusts: a Regulation 114 Trust and a supplemental collateral trust (the “Supplemental Trust” and, together with the Regulation 114 Trust, the “Collateral Trusts”).  Losses required to be reimbursed under the FLRT are subject to an aggregate limit equal to the assets held in the Collateral Trusts at any point in time.  
At inception, the Supplemental Trust contained the original $300 million of Series B Notes and $100 million of cash and fixed income securities.  During 2017, in order to further support BAM’s long-term capital position and business prospects, HG Global agreed to contribute the original $203 million of Series A Notes into the Supplemental Trust. At the same time HG Global and BAM also agreed to change the payment terms of the Series B Notes, so that payments will reduce principal and accrued interest on a pro rata basis, consistent with the payment terms on the Series A Notes. The terms of the Series B Notes had previously stipulated that payments would first reduce interest owed, then reduce principal owed once all accrued interest had been paid. The NYDFS approved the change during 2017. In connection with the contribution and change in payment terms of the Series B Notes, the Series A Notes were merged into the Series B Notes. 
The Regulation 114 Trust target balance is equal to gross ceded unearned premiums and unpaid ceded loss and LAE expenses, if any.  The Supplemental Trust target balance is equal to $603 million.  As the BAM Surplus Notes are repaid over time, the BAM Surplus Notes will be replaced in the Supplemental Trust by cash and fixed income securities. The Collateral Trust balances must be at target levels before excess funds can be distributed out of the Supplemental Trust.
2

If, at any point in time, the sum of the Regulation 114 Trust balance and the Supplemental Trust balance equals zero, BAM may choose to terminate the FLRT on a runoff basis. However, HG Re can elect to continue the FLRT by depositing into the Regulation 114 Trust assets with a fair market value not less than the greater of (i) $100 million or (ii) 10% of the then Regulation 114 Trust target balance.  
The FLRT is a perpetual agreement, with an initial term of 10 years. The FLRT can be amended after the first 10-year period and after each subsequent 5-year period on a prospective basis. If the parties are unable to mutually agree to amended terms, the dispute is resolved through arbitration, according to certain principles agreed to by the parties. Amended contract terms must be approved by the NYDFS. Should BAM consider the amended terms unacceptable, it has the option to purchase HG Re, or cause another reinsurer to purchase HG Re, at fair value. 
Pursuant to the FLRT, BAM’s underwriting guidelines may only be amended with the consent of HG Re. In addition, HG Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of HG Global, has the right to designate two directors for election to BAM’s board of directors.
In addition to the FLRT, BAM is party to a collateralized excess of loss reinsurance agreement provided by Fidus Re, Ltd. (“Fidus Re”), a Bermuda based special purpose insurer created solely to provide reinsurance protection to BAM. Fidus Re was capitalized by the issuance of $100 million of insurance linked securities. The proceeds from issuance were placed in a collateral trust supporting Fidus Re’s obligations to BAM. The insurance linked securities were issued by Fidus Re with an initial term of 12 years, and are callable 5 years after the date of issuance. Fidus Re reinsures 90% of aggregate losses exceeding $165 million on a portion of BAM’s financial guarantee portfolio (the “Covered Portfolio”) up to a total reimbursement of $100 million. The Covered Portfolio consists of approximately 73% of BAM’s portfolio of financial guaranty policies issued through December 31, 2018. 
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, White Mountains reported $926 million and $860 million of total assets, and $496 million and $516 million of total equity related to HG Global. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, White Mountains owned 96.9% of HG Global’s preferred equity and 88.4% of its common equity. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, White Mountains reported $15 million and $16 million of non-controlling interests related to HG Global. 
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, White Mountains reported $555 million and $541 million of total assets, and $(171) million and $(163) million of non-controlling interest related to BAM.
Competition
The municipal bond insurance industry is highly competitive. BAM’s primary competitor is Assured Guaranty Ltd. (“Assured”). 
BAM and Assured each seeks to differentiate itself through financial strength ratings, claims paying resources and underwriting strategies. BAM believes it has a number of distinct competitive advantages. BAM’s insured portfolio consists only of essential public purpose U.S. municipal bonds, and it has no exposure to mortgage and asset-backed securities, derivatives, non-U.S. structured or sovereign credits or territorial credits, such as Puerto Rico. BAM believes that, over time, its mutual structure will deliver a cost of capital advantage relative to its stock company competitors.
BAM seeks to provide transparency with respect to its insured portfolio and each insured issuer. In order to allow issuers and investors in BAM-insured municipal bonds to monitor financial strength first-hand, BAM publishes Credit Profiles on every insured issuer. Credit Profiles are accessible by CUSIP, obligor, state or sector on BAM’s website.
Pricing (i.e., premium level) is affected by a number of factors, including interest rate levels, credits spreads, trading value, and capture rate (i.e., the percentage of total interest savings captured in the form of insurance premium). All other things being equal, pricing is higher when interest rates are higher, credit spreads are wider, BAM’s trading value is higher relative to competitors and the capture rate is higher.

(1) The original par amount per issue does not include refunded and re-issued deals. 
Insured Credit Watchlist
BAM management maintains a surveillance committee that evaluates the credit profile of each insured municipal bond on a periodic basis. The surveillance committee places each insured municipal bond into one of four surveillance categories, the last two of which represent insured municipal bonds that are on BAM’s insured credit watchlist. Insured municipal bonds on the watchlist are monitored closely and are subject to BAM’s distressed credit management procedures, including a remediation plan developed in consultation with BAM’s legal counsel and consultants. The objectives of any remediation plan are to address the problems the issuer is facing, to address any external factors impacting the credit, to ensure that creditors’ rights are enforced and to cure any breaches that may have occurred with respect to any credit triggers or covenants. BAM may work with other insurers, municipal bondholders and/or interested parties on remediation efforts, as applicable.
Surveillance category 3 represents insured municipal bonds whose issuers are experiencing financial, legal or administrative issues causing overall credit quality deterioration, but whose probability of generating an insured loss is considered remote. Surveillance category 4 represents insured municipal bonds where a loss is expected or losses have been paid and have not been recovered or are not recoverable. As of December 31, 2018, BAM did not have any credits assigned to surveillance category 3 or surveillance category 4.

NSM
During 2018, White Mountains acquired a 95.0% equity interest in NSM for cash consideration of $276 million. NSM is a full-service managing general underwriting agency (“MGU”) and program administrator for specialty property and casualty insurance. The company places insurance in niche sectors such as specialty transportation, social services and real estate. On behalf of its insurance carrier partners, NSM manages all aspects of the placement process, including product development, marketing, underwriting, policy issuance and claims. NSM earns commissions based on the volume and profitability of the insurance that it places. NSM does not take insurance risk.
NSM distributes through a variety of channels. Commercial products are sold through a network of roughly 6,000 independent brokers. NSM also transacts business on a “direct to consumer” basis in certain segments (e.g., collector car, non-standard personal lines).
As of December 31, 2018, NSM had approximately 100 insurance carrier partners. NSM has consistently generated strong loss ratios for its insurance carrier partners, expanding its programs when market conditions are attractive and shrinking and/or shutting down its programs when market conditions are challenging. This practice has led to longstanding insurance carrier partner relationships, in some cases over 20 years. As of December 31, 2018, the five largest carrier partners account for approximately 58% of total premiums placed by NSM, with the largest carrier partner accounting for approximately 33%. 
Historically, NSM has grown both organically and inorganically through acquisitions. Since its inception in 1990, NSM has completed over 20 acquisitions, including two sizable acquisitions under White Mountains’s ownership. On May 18, 2018, NSM acquired 100% of Fresh Insurance Services Group Limited (“Fresh Insurance”). Fresh Insurance is an insurance broker that focuses on non-standard personal lines products in the United Kingdom. On December 3, 2018, NSM acquired all of the net assets of KBK Insurance Group, Inc. and KBK Premium Services, Inc. (collectively, “KBK”). KBK is a specialty MGU focused on the towing and transportation space. 
The NSM segment also includes White Mountains Catskill Holdings, Inc., the immediate holding company of NSM. As of December 31, 2018, White Mountains reported $627 million of total assets and $298 million of total equity related to NSM. As of December 31, 2018, White Mountains owned 95.5% of NSM and reported $14 million of non-controlling interest related to NSM.
Competition
NSM operates in a highly competitive property and casualty insurance intermediary industry. Competitors are differentiated based on price, conditions of coverage, loss ratio performance, quality of service, technology and other factors. NSM’s primary competitors are typically specialty insurance carriers and their agents.
Verticals
NSM’s business consists of over 15 active programs that are broadly categorized into five market verticals. The following table presents the controlled premium and commission revenues by vertical for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:

A description of the key programs within each market vertical follows:
Specialty Transportation
The specialty transportation vertical consists of NSM’s U.S. collector car programs as well as all other transportation-related programs in the United States. NSM operates its U.S. collector car business through three programs: (i) American Collectors Insurance, (ii) Condon Skelly and (iii) Heacock Classic. Each program has an exclusive underwriting contract with an insurance carrier partner to provide insurance coverage for antique and classic cars, vintage motorcycles and related automotive collectibles. The other large program in the specialty transportation vertical is KBK, which is an MGU primarily focused on providing insurance coverages for the towing businesses (e.g., tow truck operators, dealers, and repair shops). NSM also offers specialty insurance coverage for motor carriers and owner operators through its True Transport and Transport Specialties programs.
Real Estate
The real estate vertical consists of NSM’s specialty real estate programs. The largest program is CHAMP, which specializes in providing insurance coverage (e.g., property, general liability, umbrella) for wind-exposed coastal condominium associations. NSM also offers specialty insurance coverages for non-coastal apartment complexes, condominiums and hotels and motels through its HabPro program.
Social Services
The social services segment consists of three key programs: (i) Care Providers Insurance Services, which provides insurance coverages to non-profit social services organizations such as private/charter schools, charitable institutions and adult & youth centers, (ii) Addiction Treatment Providers Insurance, which provides insurance coverages to addiction treatment providers and mental healthcare facilities, and (iii) Sports & Wellness Insurance, which provides insurance coverages to a broad range of sports and wellness organizations such as fitness centers, yoga studios and university sponsored recreational programs and groups.
United Kingdom
The United Kingdom vertical consists of all of NSM’s U.K. based programs. The two largest programs today are Vantage Insurance Services (“Vantage”) and Fresh Insurance. Vantage provides a variety of specialty insurance coverages in the U.K. market, including coverages for mid-market and high-end collector cars and the outdoor leisure industry (e.g., motor caravans and trailers). Fresh Insurance focuses on non-standard auto insurance and buildings and content insurance for non-standard properties.
Other
The other vertical consists of approximately 10 other programs, providing a wide variety of tailored insurance coverages to niche sectors including (i) professional liability insurance for architects and engineers, (ii) packaged insurance solutions for outplacement & staffing agencies, and (iii) workers compensation insurance coverages primarily for artisan contractors and restaurants and hotels.

MEDIAALPHA
In March 2014, White Mountains acquired a controlling interest in MediaAlpha. On October 5, 2017, White Mountains acquired 131,579 additional newly-issued Class A common units of MediaAlpha for $13 million in connection with MediaAlpha’s acquisition of certain assets associated with the Health, Life and Medicare insurance business of Healthplans.com. Through December 31, 2018, White Mountains has invested approximately $48 million in MediaAlpha ($21 million net of distributions received of $27 million).
On February 26, 2019, MediaAlpha completed the sale of a significant minority stake to Insignia Capital Group in connection with a recapitalization and cash distribution to existing equityholders. MediaAlpha also repurchased a portion of the holdings of existing equityholders. White Mountains retained a 42% ownership interest in MediaAlpha on a fully-diluted basis. As a result of the transaction, White Mountains also expects that it will no longer consolidate MediaAlpha in its financial statements and will mark its interest in MediaAlpha to fair value at the transaction closing date and in subsequent periods. 
MediaAlpha is a leading marketing technology company that enables the programmatic buying and selling of vertical-specific, performance-based media between advertisers (buyers of advertising inventory) and publishers (sellers of advertising inventory) through cost-per-click, cost-per-call and cost-per-lead pricing models. MediaAlpha’s media buying platform (“MediaAlpha for Advertisers”) enables advertisers to create and automate data-driven bidding strategies designed to improve the efficiency and enhance the overall performance of their marketing campaigns. MediaAlpha has developed distinctive platform solutions for a range of insurance verticals, including auto, motorcycle, home, renter, health and life, and non-insurance verticals, including travel, education and personal finance.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, White Mountains reported $88 million and $97 million of total assets and $42 million and $37 million of total equity related to MediaAlpha. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, White Mountains owned 61.0% and 64.4% of MediaAlpha. On a fully diluted basis, White Mountains owned 58.9% of MediaAlpha at December 31, 2018 and 2017. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, White Mountains reported $16 million and $13 million of non-controlling interest related to MediaAlpha.
Business Model
MediaAlpha generates revenue based on the value of the media bought and sold by advertisers and publishers through its exchange platforms. MediaAlpha’s cost of sales is comprised primarily of revenue share-based payments to publishers and traffic acquisition costs paid to top tier search engines.  MediaAlpha's primary business model is to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers and to retain a percentage of the advertising spend as gross profit.  MediaAlpha only takes media risk when advertising revenue is generated through its owned and operated websites, with cost of sales consisting primarily of traffic acquisition spend on top tier search engines such as Google. 
MediaAlpha offers its partners the flexibility to transact using MediaAlpha’s platforms through the following relationship types:

• | Open Exchange: Under this model, the advertiser pays for media placement on publisher sites, on a source-transparent basis, through an agreement with MediaAlpha. MediaAlpha secures and manages the advertising partnerships, as well as the publisher relationships. MediaAlpha bills the advertiser for the media purchased through the Open Exchange and is responsible for collections from the advertiser and disbursements to publisher partners. Revenue recognized represents the gross dollars transacted through the Open Exchange (“transaction value”) and cost of sales is comprised of the revenue share payments to publisher partners. 


• | Buyer Exchange: Under this model, the advertiser uses MediaAlpha’s advertiser platform to manage and optimize media campaigns that place ads on third-party publisher sites or advertising networks that do not use MediaAlpha for Publishers for the sale of their media. MediaAlpha tracks the transaction value of the media purchased through MediaAlpha’s platform from these third-party media partners and bills the advertiser a platform fee based on that total transaction value. Revenue is recognized on a net basis, representing the licensing fee, since MediaAlpha is not responsible for disbursing funds to the advertiser’s various third-party media partners. 


• | Seller Exchange: Under this model, the publisher uses MediaAlpha’s publisher platform to manage, track, and optimize the media spend from advertisers with whom the publisher maintains direct contractual relationships. The publisher utilizes the platform as its ad serving, demand management, yield optimization, reporting, and analytics platform to enable the direct, programmatic sale of its performance media to its advertisers. MediaAlpha tracks the total transaction value generated through the publisher platform, but is not responsible for billing or collections from the publisher’s advertisers. MediaAlpha bills the publisher a platform fee based on the transaction value of the media sold by the publisher and recognizes this revenue on a net basis.

MediaAlpha operates in several data-rich verticals, including Property & Casualty (“P&C”), Health, Life and Medicare (“HLM”), Travel, and Others (Education and Consumer Finance). 

• | P&C consists of advertisers who acquire customers with the intent of selling automobile, home or motorcycle insurance coverage. The advertisers in this vertical are primarily national insurance carriers and advertising agencies commissioned by carriers. The publishers in this vertical are a mix of third-party publishers and national carriers (“Carrier Publishers”) and MediaAlpha’s owned and operated properties. 


• | HLM consists of advertisers who acquire customers with the intent of selling them health, life and Medicare insurance coverage. The advertisers in this vertical are primarily national carriers and advertising agencies commissioned by carriers. The publishers in this vertical are primarily third-party publishers and MediaAlpha’s owned and operated properties. On October 5, 2017, MediaAlpha acquired certain assets associated with the Health, Life and Medicare insurance business of Healthplans.com. The acquisition allowed MediaAlpha to supplement its position as the leading marketing technology provider for advertisers and publishers in this market. See Note 4 — “Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets” on page F-30. 


• | Travel consists of advertisers who acquire customers with the intent of selling a leisure travel item (e.g. air fare, hotel, package deal, car rental). The advertisers in this vertical are primarily national brands, online travel agents, travel metasearch sites and advertising agencies commissioned by national brands. The publishers in this vertical are a mix of third-party publishers and MediaAlpha’s owned and operated properties. On January 15, 2016, MediaAlpha acquired certain travel-related assets from Oversee.net, including owned and operated websites, domain names and key customer relationships. The acquisition accelerated MediaAlpha’s entry into the travel vertical, providing MediaAlpha with access to a high quality owned and operated inventory and existing advertiser relationships, consisting primarily of major online travel agents, metasearch sites and national brands. See Note 4 — “Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets” on page F-30. 


• | Other verticals MediaAlpha operates in include the following:

Strategy
MediaAlpha’s goal is to gain adoption of its technology platforms in all data-rich, performance-marketing verticals. MediaAlpha believes that online advertising spend will continue to shift toward measurable, data-driven models and that advertisers will continue to focus on performance and return on investment (“ROI”) on advertising spend. Since inception, MediaAlpha’s approach has been to facilitate this shift by providing partners with unparalleled pricing control and full source transparency down to the domain level, and by continually improving its technology platforms to provide key constituents with more and deeper capabilities.
Competition
The marketing industry is very competitive, highly fragmented and historically dominated by advertising networks. MediaAlpha’s direct competitors include QuinStreet Inc., Intent Media and Clicktripz. MediaAlpha differentiates itself from the competition in the following areas:

• | Technology: MediaAlpha’s proprietary technology provides advertisers with a set of robust tools to help them manage their adverting spend programmatically, on a granular, real time basis.


• | Transparency: The marketplaces powered by MediaAlpha’s technology are fully source transparent, offering full placement-level pricing control to the advertiser.


• | Control: MediaAlpha’s technology gives granular, self-service buying control to advertisers and enables publishers to control and manage all aspects of how their media is made available to advertisers.


• | Quality: MediaAlpha’s publishers include some of the largest and most reputable names in the industry.

OTHER OPERATIONS
White Mountains’s Other Operations segment consists of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, White Mountains Capital, Inc. (“WM Capital”), its other intermediate holding companies, its wholly-owned investment management subsidiary, WM Advisors, investment assets managed by WM Advisors, its interests in PassportCard Limited (“PassportCard”) and DavidShield Life Insurance Agency (2000) Ltd. (“DavidShield”) (collectively “PassportCard/DavidShield”) and Kudu Investment Management, LLC (“Kudu”), certain other consolidated and unconsolidated entities (“Other Operating Businesses”) and certain other strategic investments (“Strategic Investments”).
PassportCard/DavidShield
In April 2015, White Mountains acquired a 50% interest in PassportCard, a UK-based global managing general agency (“MGA”) offering the travel industry’s first real-time, paperless insurance solution, which facilitates claim payouts in minutes wherever and whenever the customer needs it.  PassportCard directly markets its solutions in select markets and also franchises its offerings to major travel insurance and medical assistance companies.  PassportCard receives commissions for placing policies with its insurance carrier partners and licensing fees for use of its card-based technology.
On January 24, 2018, White Mountains acquired 50% of DavidShield for a net purchase price of $28 million.  As a result of the transaction, White Mountains and its joint venture partner both hold 50% stakes in PassportCard and DavidShield.  DavidShield is an MGA that is the leading provider of expatriate medical insurance in Israel and uses the same card-based delivery system as PassportCard.  Since 2000, DavidShield has delivered industry leading medical insurance solutions to diplomats, non-governmental organizations and thousands of multinational corporations and individuals in over 95 countries.
There are a number of distinct advantages to the PassportCard and DavidShield insurance solutions that differentiate them in the marketplace.  Through the real-time claims handling process, PassportCard and DavidShield are generally able to control claims, loss costs and fraud upfront, driving lower than industry average loss ratios.  Further, the card-based, paperless delivery model enables a superior customer experience, commanding industry-leading customer retention rates and strong brand loyalty.
PassportCard and DavidShield launched originally in Israel and are now focused on international expansion.  In the second quarter of 2018, PassportCard launched in Australia (under the “TravelCard” brand). 
White Mountains’s non-controlling equity interests in PassportCard and DavidShield are accounted for at fair value within other long-term investments.  As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of these interests totaled $75 million. As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of White Mountains’s interest in PassportCard was $21 million.
Kudu
On February 5, 2018, White Mountains entered into an agreement to fund up to $125 million in Kudu, a capital provider to asset management and wealth management firms. As of December 31, 2018, White Mountains owned 49.5% of Kudu. Kudu specializes in providing capital solutions to asset managers and registered investment advisers for purposes including generational ownership transfers, management buyouts, acquisition and growth finance and legacy partner liquidity. Kudu also provides strategic assistance to investees from time to time. Kudu’s capital solutions typically are structured as long-term or permanent revenue shares.
As of December 31, 2018, Kudu had completed transactions with two asset management firms and one wealth manager since the inception of White Mountains’s commitment. As of December 31, 2018, White Mountains had funded $31 million of its $125 million commitment, plus an additional $4 million for working capital. White Mountains’s non-controlling equity interest in Kudu is accounted for at fair value within other long-term investments. As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of this interest was $31 million.
On February 14, 2019, White Mountains entered into a definitive agreement to buy all of the interests in Kudu held by certain funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”) for approximately $50 million.  In connection with the transaction, White Mountains will assume all of Oaktree’s unfunded capital commitments to Kudu, increasing White Mountains’s total unfunded Kudu capital commitment to approximately $167 million. If Kudu calls additional capital from Oaktree prior to the closing of the transaction, the purchase price would increase by the amount of the capital called, and White Mountains’s assumed unfunded capital commitment would decrease by an equal amount.
As a result of the transaction, White Mountains’s ownership of Kudu will increase from 49.5% to 99.0%, and it expects to consolidate Kudu in its financial statements after closing.

13

WM Advisors 
WM Advisors manages substantially all of White Mountains’s investment portfolio, which primarily consists of fixed maturity investments, short-term investments, common equity securities and other long-term investments.
Previously, WM Advisors was a registered investment adviser that also managed investment portfolios for former White Mountains’s subsidiaries OneBeacon Insurance Group, Ltd. (“OneBeacon”) and Sirius International Insurance Group, Ltd. (“Sirius Group”), and former White Mountains affiliate Symetra Financial Corporation (“Symetra”). WM Advisors managed investment portfolios for each party prior to their sales and for a transition period after each respective transaction. See “Discontinued Operations” on page 48 for a description of the OneBeacon and Sirius Group transactions. As of December 31, 2017, WM Advisors no longer managed any invested assets for OneBeacon, Sirius Group or Symetra. Consequently, WM Advisors de-registered with the SEC on January 29, 2018 and is no longer a registered investment adviser.
INVESTMENTS
White Mountains’s investment philosophy is to maximize long-term after-tax total returns while taking prudent levels of risk and maintaining a diversified portfolio, subject to White Mountains’s investment guidelines and various regulatory restrictions.  Under White Mountains’s philosophy, each dollar of after-tax investment income or investment gains (realized or unrealized) is valued equally.
White Mountains maintains an equity portfolio that consists primarily of common equity securities and other long-term investments, including unconsolidated entities, private equity funds and hedge funds. White Mountains’s portfolio of common equity securities primarily consists of passive exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) and publicly-traded common equity securities that are actively managed by select third-party registered investment advisers, whom White Mountains believes have a differentiated investment strategy and approach.
White Mountains’s maintains a fixed income portfolio that consists primarily of high-quality, short-duration, fixed maturity investments and short-term investments. White Mountains invests in fixed maturity investments that are attractively priced in relation to their investment risks and actively manages the average duration of the fixed income portfolio.  As of December 31, 2018, the fixed income portfolio duration, including short-term investments, was 3.4 years. White Mountains has established relationships with select third-party registered investment advisers to manage a portion of its fixed income portfolio.
See “Portfolio Composition” on page 46.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Over the past three years, White Mountains has disposed of a number of its principal operating businesses and recorded large transaction gains. See Note 2 — “Significant Transactions” on page F-16 and Note 19 — “Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” on page F- 55 for details regarding these dispositions. A description of the largest of these dispositions follows:
OneBeacon
On September 28, 2017, Intact Financial Corporation completed its acquisition of OneBeacon Insurance Group, Ltd. in an all-cash transaction for $18.10 per share (the “OneBeacon Transaction”). White Mountains received $1.3 billion in cash proceeds and recorded a $557 million comprehensive gain from sale of discontinued operations, net of transaction costs. The comprehensive gain includes $3 million related to the reversal of accumulated other comprehensive income from benefit plan assets and obligations. 
While owned by White Mountains, OneBeacon was a provider of a wide range of property and casualty insurance products in the United States primarily through independent agencies, regional and national brokers, wholesalers and MGAs. 

Tranzact
On July 21, 2016, White Mountains completed the disposition of Tranzact Holdings, LLC (“Tranzact”) to an affiliate of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC and received $221 million in cash proceeds. The increase to White Mountains’s book value from the sale of Tranzact was $82 million. 
While owned by White Mountains, Tranzact was a provider of comprehensive direct-to-consumer customer acquisition solutions, primarily to insurance companies.

Sirius Group
On April 18, 2016, White Mountains completed the disposition of Sirius Group to CM International Pte. Ltd. and CM Bermuda Limited (collectively “CMI”). White Mountains received approximately $2.6 billion in cash proceeds and recorded a $477 million comprehensive gain from sale of discontinued operations.

Sirius Global Solutions, formerly known as White Mountains Solutions, specialized in the acquisition and management of runoff liabilities for insurance and reinsurance companies both in the United States and internationally. 
REGULATION
United States
Insurance Regulation
BAM is subject to regulation and supervision in New York and each of the states where it is licensed to conduct business. Generally, state regulatory authorities have broad supervisory and administrative powers over such matters as licenses, standards of solvency, premium rates, policy forms, investments, statutory deposits, methods of accounting, form and content of financial statements, claims reserves and LAE liabilities, reinsurance, minimum capital and surplus requirements, dividends and other distributions to shareholders, annual and other report filings and other market conduct. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders. White Mountains believes that BAM is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations pertaining to its business that would have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operation in the event of non-compliance.
NSM, through its subsidiaries is licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. White Mountains believes NSM is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations pertaining to its business that would have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations in the event of non-compliance.
State Accreditation and Monitoring
State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing marketing and sales practices, policyholder services, claims management and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally test and enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.
New York Insurance Law establishes single and aggregate risk limits for financial guaranty insurers. Single risk limits for financial guaranty insurers are applicable to all obligations issued by a single entity and backed by a single revenue source. Insurance on municipal obligations is also subject to a limit where the insured average annual debt service for a single risk, net of qualifying reinsurance and collateral, may not exceed 10% of policyholders' surplus and contingency reserves. In addition, the insured principal of municipal obligations attributable to any single risk, net of qualifying reinsurance and collateral, is limited to 75% of policyholders' surplus and contingency reserves. 
The New York Insurance Law also establishes aggregate risk limits on the basis of total outstanding principal and interest of guaranteed obligations insured net of qualifying reinsurance and collateral (the “Aggregate Net Liability”), compared to the sum of the insurer’s policyholders’ surplus and contingency reserves. Under these limits, policyholders' surplus and contingency reserves for municipal obligations must not be less than 0.33% of the Aggregate Net Liability. If a financial guaranty insurer fails to comply with single or aggregate risk limits, the NYDFS has broad discretion to order the insurer to cease new business originations. As of December 31, 2018, BAM was in compliance with the single and aggregate risk limits.
No payment of interest or principal on the BAM Surplus Notes may be made without the approval of the NYDFS.
Under the New York Insurance Law, BAM must establish a contingency reserve to protect policyholders against the effect of adverse economic developments or cycles or other unforeseen circumstances. BAM determines its contingency reserves by applying the calculations required by each state in which it is licensed and recording a contingency reserve equal to the calculation that results in the highest contingency reserve. 
When considering the principal amount guaranteed, New York Insurance Law permits the insurer to take credit for amounts ceded through reinsurance. 
The NYDFS, the regulatory authority of BAM’s state of domicile, conducts periodic examinations of insurance companies domiciled in New York, usually at five-year intervals. In 2014, the NYDFS commenced and completed its examination of BAM and issued a Report on Examination of BAM for the period beginning at BAM’s inception and ending December 31, 2013. The reports did not note any significant regulatory issues concerning BAM.
15

Investments
BAM is subject to state laws and regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that dictate the quality, quantity and general types of investments they may hold. Non-compliance may cause non-conforming investments to be non-admitted when measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, may require divestiture. 
Holding Company Structure
Regulations under certain state insurance holding company acts contain reporting requirements relating to the capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations of insurance entities. These regulations also contain special reporting and prior approval requirements with respect to certain transactions among affiliates. The domiciliary states of insurance entities impose regulatory application and approval requirements on acquisitions that may be deemed to confer control, as that concept is defined under the applicable state laws. In some states as little as 5% may be deemed to confer control, and the application process for approval can be extensive and time consuming.
Legislation
Although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, federal legislation and administrative policies impact the industry. In addition, legislation has been introduced in recent years that, if enacted, could result in the federal government assuming a more direct role in the regulation of the insurance industry. Notably, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) created the Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the Treasury Department, which is responsible for gathering information and monitoring the insurance industry to identify gaps in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or U.S. financial system.
In addition to emerging federal regulation, many states are adopting laws that attempt to strengthen the ability of regulators to understand and regulate the risk management practices of insurers and insurance groups. For example, many states have adopted measures related to the NAIC’s Solvency Modernization Initiative (“SMI”), which have included model regulations that require insurers to summarize their key risks and risk management strategies to regulators. The SMI resulted in a 2010 amendment to the NAIC’s Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (the “Model Holding Company Act”), which requires the ultimate controlling person in an insurer’s holding company structure to identify and report material enterprise risks to the state insurance regulator. 
The SMI also produced the NAIC Risk Management and Own Risk Solvency Model Act (“ORSA”), which requires insurers meeting premium thresholds to maintain a risk management framework, and annually submit a comprehensive report designed to assess the adequacy of an insurer’s risk management practices, including risks related to the insurer’s future solvency position. 
Premium Accounts Held in Trust
NSM maintains approximately 40 trust accounts in order to comply with fiduciary requirements under U.S. state and U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) insurance laws and regulations relating to premium trust accounts. Under such laws, insurance agencies that do not make immediate remittances to counterparties (such as insurance companies, clients or other producers to which premium, commissions or other amounts are due from time to time) must segregate funds owed to such counterparties and these funds must be held in trust for the insurance company, client or other relevant third-party payee. NSM’s use of trust accounts is routinely subject to audits by carrier partners and other external auditors. NSM believes that it is in compliance with its fiduciary requirements.
Bermuda
Insurance Regulation
The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and related regulations, as amended (the “Insurance Act”), regulates the insurance business of HG Re, and provides that no person may carry on any insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer under the Insurance Act by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”). The BMA, in deciding whether to grant registration, has broad discretion to act as it thinks fit in the public interest. The BMA is required by the Insurance Act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and, in particular, whether it has, or has available to it, adequate knowledge and expertise to operate an insurance business. In addition, the BMA is required by the Insurance Act to determine whether a person who proposes to control 10 percent, 20 percent, 33 percent or 50 percent (as applicable) of the voting powers of a Bermuda registered insurer or its parent company is a fit and proper person to exercise such degree of control. See “Dividend Capacity” on page 49 for further discussion.
The continued registration of an applicant as an insurer is subject to the applicant complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the BMA may impose from time to time. The Insurance Act also grants to the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of Bermuda insurance companies.
The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards on Bermuda insurance companies, as well as auditing and reporting requirements. White Mountains believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations pertaining to its business that would have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations in the event of non-compliance.
16

Certain Other Bermuda Law Considerations
The Company is an exempted company incorporated and organized under the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda (the “Companies Act”). As a result, the Company is required to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act regulating the payment of dividends and making of distributions from contributed surplus. A company is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend, or making a distribution out of contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that:

(1) | the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or


(2) | the realizable value of the company’s assets would thereby be less than its liabilities.

Under the Company’s bye-laws, each common share is entitled to dividends if, and when, dividends are declared by its board of directors, subject to any preferred dividend rights of the holders of any preference shares. Issued share capital is the aggregate par value of the company’s issued shares, and the share premium account is the aggregate amount paid for issued shares over and above their par value. Share premium accounts may be reduced in certain limited circumstances. In addition, the Companies Act regulates return of capital, reduction of capital and any purchase or redemption of shares by the Company.
Although the Company is incorporated in Bermuda, it has been designated as a non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes by the BMA. Pursuant to its non-resident status, the Company may hold any currency other than Bermuda dollars and convert that currency into any other currency, other than Bermuda dollars, without restriction.
Shares may be offered or sold in Bermuda only in compliance with the provisions of the Investment Business Act 2003 and the Exchange Control Act 1972, and related regulations of Bermuda which regulate the sale of securities in Bermuda. In addition, specific permission is required from the BMA pursuant to the provisions of the Exchange Control Act 1972 and related regulations, for all issuances and transfers of securities of Bermuda companies, other than in cases where the BMA has granted a general permission. The BMA in its policy dated June 1, 2005 provides that where any equity securities, including the Company’s common shares, of a Bermuda company are listed on an appointed stock exchange, general permission is given for the issue and subsequent transfer of any securities of a company from and/or to a non-resident, for as long as any equity securities of such company remain so listed. The New York Stock Exchange is deemed to be an appointed stock exchange under Bermuda law. Notwithstanding the above general permission, the BMA has granted the Company permission to, subject to its common shares being listed on an appointed stock exchange, (a) issue and transfer its shares, up to the amount of its authorized capital from time to time, to persons resident and non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes; (b) issue and transfer options, warrants, depositary receipts, rights, and other securities; and (c) issue and transfer loan notes and other debt instruments and options, warrants, receipts, rights over loan notes and other debt instruments to persons resident and non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes.
On January 1, 2019 the Economic Substance Act 2018 (the “ESA”) came into effect in Bermuda. Under the provisions of the ESA, every Bermuda registered entity engaged in a “relevant activity” must satisfy economic substance requirements by maintaining a substantial economic presence in Bermuda. Carrying on as a business either in insurance or holding entity activities (both as defined in the ESA and Economic Substance Regulations 2018) are relevant activities under the ESA. To the extent that the ESA applies to any of our entities registered in Bermuda, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with economic substance requirements by filing an annual economic substance declaration with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda.

Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians (other than spouses of Bermudians, holders of permanent resident certificates and holders of working resident certificates) may not engage in any gainful occupation in Bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit. Work permits may be granted or extended by the Bermuda government upon showing that, after proper public advertisement in most cases, no Bermudian (or spouse of a Bermudian or a holder of a permanent resident’s certificate or holder of a working resident’s certificate) is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position. A waiver from advertising is automatically granted in respect of any chief executive officer position and other chief officer positions. The employer can also make a request for a waiver from the requirement to advertise in certain other cases, as expressed in the Bermuda government's work permit policies. Currently, all of the Company's Bermuda-based professional employees who require work permits have been granted work permits by the Bermuda government.
