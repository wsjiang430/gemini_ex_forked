See the "Glossary of terms and acronyms" for definitions and descriptions of terms used throughout this annual report.
A.    General
We are a holding company and through wholly-owned subsidiaries we provide private mortgage insurance, other mortgage credit risk management solutions, and ancillary services. In 2018, our net premiums written were $1.0 billion and our primary NIW was $50.5 billion. As of December 31, 2018, our direct primary IIF was $209.7 billion and our direct primary RIF was $54.1 billion. For further information about our results of operations, see our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 and our MD&A in Item 7. As of December 31, 2018, our principal mortgage insurance subsidiary, MGIC, was licensed in all 50 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam.  During 2018, we wrote new insurance in each of those jurisdictions.
BUSINESS STRATEGIES
Our business strategies are to 1) prudently grow IIF, 2) pursue new business opportunities that meet our return objectives, 3) preserve and expand our role and that of the PMI industry in housing finance policy, 4) manage and deploy capital to optimize the creation of shareholder value and 5) expand and develop the talents of our co-workers. 
Following are several of our 2018 accomplishments that furthered our business strategies.

• | Increased primary NIW from $49.1 billion in 2017 to $50.5 billion in 2018 and increased primary IIF by more than 7.6% year-over-year. The NIW is consistent with the Company's risk and return goals.


• | Held leadership roles in key trade associations.


• | Continued to enhance the reputation of the Company and the industry relative to changing housing finance policy and a broader role for PMI.


• | Positioned ourselves for a successful launch in the first quarter 2019 of MiQTM, our loan level pricing system that establishes our premium rates based on a borrower's individual risk profile and loan attributes, and considers more attributes than were considered in 2018.


• | Executed a $318 million insurance linked note transaction, which allows the Company to better manage its risk profile and provides a new source of capital.


• | Increased dividends from MGIC to our holding company from $140 million in 2017 to $220 million in 2018.


• | Initiated ratings from A.M. Best and received an A- rating.


• | Executed $175 million in share repurchases for more than 4% of our common stock outstanding.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND ITS OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
We established the PMI industry in 1957 to provide a private market alternative to federal government insurance programs. PMI covers losses from homeowner defaults on residential mortgage loans, reducing, and in some instances eliminating, the loss to the insured institution.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been the major purchasers of the mortgage loans underlying new insurance written by private mortgage insurers. The GSEs purchase residential mortgage loans as part of their governmental mandate to provide liquidity in the secondary mortgage market. The GSEs cannot buy low down payment mortgage loans without certain forms of credit enhancement. Lenders generally have used private mortgage insurance to satisfy this credit enhancement requirement. Therefore, PMI facilitates the sale of low down payment mortgages in the secondary mortgage market to the GSEs and plays an important role in the housing finance system by assisting consumers, especially first-time and lower net-worth homebuyers, to finance homes with low down payment mortgages. PMI also reduces the regulatory capital that depository institutions are required to hold against certain low down payment mortgages that they hold as assets. (GSE programs initiated in 2018 that provide loan level default coverage by various (re)insurers (which may include affiliates of private mortgage insurers) are discussed below.)
Because the GSEs have been the major purchasers of the mortgages underlying new insurance written by private mortgage insurers, the PMI industry in the U.S. is defined in large part by the requirements and practices of the GSEs. These requirements and practices, as well as those of the federal regulators that oversee the GSEs and lenders, impact the operating results and financial performance of private mortgage insurers. In 2008, the federal government took control of the GSEs through a conservatorship process. The FHFA is the conservator 


  MGIC Investment Corporation 2018 Form 10-K | 6

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries
 | Glossary of terms and acronyms

of the GSEs and has the authority to control and direct their operations. In the past, members of Congress have introduced several bills intended to change the business practices of the GSEs and the FHA, however, no legislation has been enacted. 
The Administration issued a June 2018 report indicating that the conservatorship of the GSEs should end and that the GSEs should transition to fully private entities. It is unclear whether and when that would occur and how that would impact us. As a result of the matters referred to above, it is uncertain what role the GSEs, FHA and private capital, including private mortgage insurance, will play in the domestic residential housing finance system in the future. The timing and impact on our business or any resulting changes is uncertain. Some changes would require Congressional action to implement and it is difficult to estimate when any action would be final and how long any associated phase-in period may last. See our risk factor titled “Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses” in Item 1A.
The GSEs have private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements, or PMIERs, for private mortgage insurers that insure loans delivered to or purchased by the GSEs. The financial requirements of the PMIERs require a mortgage insurer’s Available Assets to equal or exceed its Minimum Required Assets. While on an overall basis, the amount of Available Assets MGIC must hold in order to continue to insure GSE loans is greater under the PMIERs than the amount state regulation currently requires, our reinsurance transactions mitigate the negative effect of the PMIERs on our returns. See "Regulation – Direct Regulation" below for information about our compliance with the financial requirements of the PMIERs. 
The private mortgage insurance industry is greatly impacted by macroeconomic conditions that affect home loan originations and credit performance of home loans, including unemployment rates, home prices, restrictions on mortgage credit due to underwriting standards, interest rates, household formations and homeownership rates. During the last several years preceding the financial crisis, the mortgage lending industry increasingly made home loans with higher risk profiles. In certain sections of this Annual Report, we discuss our insurance written in 2005-2008 separately from our insurance written in earlier and later years. Beginning in 2007, job creation slowed and the housing markets began slowing in certain areas, with declines in certain other areas. In 2008 and 2009, employment in the U.S. decreased substantially and nearly all geographic areas in the U.S. experienced home price declines. Together, these conditions resulted in significant adverse developments for us and our industry. The operating environment for private 


mortgage insurers has materially improved in recent years as the economy has recovered. 
During 2018, $292 billion of mortgages were insured with primary coverage by private mortgage insurers, compared to, $270 billion in each of 2017 and 2016. Although the 2018 volume was significantly greater than the recent low in 2010 of $70 billion, it remains below the volumes of 2001 through 2007 when, on average, approximately $311 billion of mortgages were insured with primary coverage by private mortgage insurers.
For most of our business, we and other private mortgage insurers compete directly with federal and state governmental and quasi-governmental agencies that sponsor government-backed mortgage insurance programs, principally the FHA, VA and USDA. The publication Inside Mortgage Finance estimates that in 2018, the FHA accounted for 29.9% of low down payment residential mortgages that were subject to FHA, VA, USDA or primary private mortgage insurance, compared to 33.9% in 2017. In the prior ten years, the FHA’s market share has been as low as 29.9% in 2018 and as high as 66.8% in 2009. Factors that influence the FHA’s market share include relative rates and fees, underwriting guidelines and loan limits of the FHA, VA, USDA, private mortgage insurers and the GSEs; lenders' perceptions of legal risks under FHA versus GSE programs; flexibility for the FHA to establish new products as a result of federal legislation and programs; returns obtained by lenders for Ginnie Mae securitization of FHA-insured loans compared to those obtained from selling loans to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac for securitization; and differences in policy terms, such as the ability of a borrower to cancel insurance coverage under certain circumstances. We cannot predict how the factors listed above or the FHA’s share of NIW will change in the future. 
Inside Mortgage Finance estimates that in 2018, the VA accounted for 24.4% of all low down payment residential mortgages that were subject to FHA, VA, USDA or primary private mortgage insurance, compared to 24.7% in 2017. In the prior ten years, the VA's market share has been as high as 27.2% in 2016 and as low as 14.3% in 2009. We believe that the VA’s market share has generally been increasing because of an increase in the number of borrowers that are eligible for the VA’s program, which offers 100% LTV loans and charges a one-time funding fee that can be included in the loan amount, and because eligible borrowers have opted to use the VA program when refinancing their mortgages.
The private mortgage insurance industry also competes with alternatives to mortgage insurance, such as investors using risk mitigation and credit risk transfer techniques other than PMI, investors willing to hold credit risk on their own balance sheets without credit enhancement, and “piggyback loans,” which combine a first lien loan with a second lien loan.


  MGIC Investment Corporation 2018 Form 10-K | 7

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries
 | Glossary of terms and acronyms

In 2018, the GSE initiated programs with loan level mortgage default coverage provided by various (re)insurers that are not mortgage insurers governed by PMIERs, and that are not selected by the lenders. While we view these programs as competing with traditional private mortgage insurance, we have participated in them and may participate in future GSE or other programs.
The GSEs (and other investors) have also used other forms of credit enhancement that did not involve traditional private mortgage insurance, such as engaging in credit-linked note transactions executed in the capital markets, or using other forms of debt issuances or securitizations that transfer credit risk directly to other investors, including competitors and an affiliate of MGIC; and using other risk mitigation techniques in conjunction with reduced levels of private mortgage insurance coverage.
In addition to the FHA, VA, other governmental agencies and the alternatives to mortgage insurance discussed above, we also compete with other mortgage insurers. The level of competition, including price competition, within the private mortgage insurance industry has intensified over the past several years. See "Our Products and Services – Sales and Marketing and Competition – Competition" below for more information about the impact on our business of competition in the private mortgage insurance industry.
In addition to being subject to the requirements and practices of the GSEs, private mortgage insurers are subject to comprehensive, detailed regulation by state insurance departments. The insurance laws of 16 jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, MGIC's domiciliary state, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to the RIF (or a similar measure) in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. The NAIC plans to revise the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers that are provided for in its Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act. A working group of state regulators has been considering since 2016 a risk-based capital framework to establish capital requirements for mortgage insurers, although no date has been established by which the NAIC must propose revisions to the capital requirements.
Due to the changing environment described above, as well as other factors discussed below, at this time the greatest uncertainty we face is whether private mortgage insurance will remain a significant credit enhancement alternative for low down payment single family mortgages. An increase in the use of alternatives to private mortgage insurance, such as GSE programs with loan level default coverage provided by (re)insurers that are not mortgage insurers subject to PMIERs, or a possible restructuring or change in the charters of the GSEs, could significantly affect our business. For additional information about this uncertainty, see our 


risk factors titled “The amount of insurance we write could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance” and “Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses” in Item 1A.

B. Our Products and Services
MORTGAGE INSURANCE
In general, there are two principal types of private mortgage insurance: “primary” and “pool.” 
Primary Insurance. Primary insurance provides mortgage default protection on individual loans and covers a percentage of the unpaid loan principal, delinquent interest and certain expenses associated with the default and subsequent foreclosure or sale approved by us (collectively, the “claim amount”). In addition to the loan principal, the claim amount is affected by the mortgage note rate and the time necessary to complete the foreclosure or sale process. The insurer generally pays the coverage percentage of the claim amount specified in the primary policy, but has the option to pay 100% of the claim amount and acquire title to the property. Primary insurance is generally written on first mortgage loans secured by owner 


  MGIC Investment Corporation 2018 Form 10-K | 8

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries
 | Glossary of terms and acronyms

occupied "single-family" homes, which are one-to-four family homes and condominiums. Primary insurance can be written on first liens secured by non-owner occupied single-family homes, which are referred to in the home mortgage lending industry as investor loans, and on vacation or second homes. Primary coverage can be used on any type of residential mortgage loan instrument approved by the mortgage insurer. 
References in this document to amounts of insurance written or in force, risk written or in force and other historical data related to our insurance refer only to direct (before giving effect to reinsurance) primary insurance, unless otherwise indicated. Primary insurance may be written on a flow basis, in which loans are insured in individual, loan-by-loan transactions, or may be written on a bulk basis, in which each loan in a portfolio of loans is individually insured in a single, bulk transaction. Our new primary insurance written was $50.5 billion in 2018, compared to $49.1 billion in 2017 and $47.9 billion in 2016. The 2018 increase compared to 2017 reflects an increase in the purchase mortgage originations we insured offsetting a decrease in the refinance originations we insured. 
The following charts show, on a direct basis, our primary IIF and primary RIF as of December 31 for the years indicated.

For loans sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the coverage percentage must comply with the requirements established by the particular GSE to which the loan is delivered. The GSEs have different loan purchase programs that allow different levels of mortgage insurance coverage. Under the “charter coverage” program, on certain loans lenders may choose a mortgage insurance coverage percentage that is less than the GSEs’ “standard coverage” and only the minimum required by the GSEs’ charters, with the GSEs paying a lower price for such loans. In 2018, nearly all of our volume was on loans with GSE standard or higher coverage.
For loans that are not sold to the GSEs, the lender determines the coverage percentage from those that we offer. Higher coverage percentages generally result in increased severity, which is the amount paid on a claim. We charge higher premium rates for higher coverage percentages. However, there can be no assurance that the higher premium rates adequately reflect the risks associated with higher coverage percentages. In accordance with GAAP for the mortgage insurance industry, reserves for losses are only established for delinquent loans. Because, historically, relatively few 


delinquencies occur in the early years of a book of business, the higher premium revenue from higher coverage has historically been recognized before any significant higher losses resulting from that higher coverage may be incurred. For more information, see “– Exposure to Catastrophic Loss; Defaults; Claims; Loss Mitigation – Claims.”
In general, mortgage insurance coverage cannot be terminated by the insurer. However, subject to certain restrictions as are specified in our insurance policy, we may terminate or rescind coverage for, among other reasons, non-payment of premium, certain material misrepresentations made in connection with the application for the insurance policy or if the loan was never eligible for coverage under our policy. Mortgage insurance coverage is renewable at the option of the insured lender, at the renewal rate fixed when the loan was initially insured. Lenders may cancel insurance written on a flow basis at any time at their option or because of mortgage repayment, which may be accelerated because of the refinancing of mortgages. In the case of a loan purchased by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, a borrower meeting certain conditions may require the mortgage servicer to cancel insurance upon the borrower’s request, generally when the principal balance of the loan is 80% or less of the home’s current value.
Mortgage insurance for loans secured by one-family, primary residences can be canceled under HOPA. In general, HOPA requires a servicer to cancel the mortgage insurance if a borrower requests cancellation when the principal balance of the loan is first scheduled to reach 80% of the original value, or reaches that percentage through payments, if 1) the borrower is current on the loan and has a “good payment history” (as defined by HOPA), 2) the borrower provides evidence as and if required by the mortgage owner that the value of the property has not declined below the original value, and 3) if required by the mortgage owner, the borrower’s equity in the property is not subject to a subordinate lien. Additionally, HOPA requires mortgage insurance to terminate automatically when the principal balance of the loan is first scheduled to reach 78% of the original value and the borrower is current on loan payments or thereafter becomes current. Annually, servicers must inform borrowers of their right to cancel or terminate mortgage insurance. The provisions of HOPA described above apply only to borrower paid mortgage insurance, which is described below.
Coverage tends to continue for borrowers experiencing economic difficulties or living in areas experiencing home price depreciation. The persistency of coverage for those borrowers coupled with cancellation of coverage for other borrowers can increase the percentage of an insurer’s portfolio covering loans with more credit risk. This development can also occur during periods of heavy mortgage refinancing because borrowers experiencing property value appreciation are less likely to require mortgage insurance at the time of 


  MGIC Investment Corporation 2018 Form 10-K | 9

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries
 | Glossary of terms and acronyms

refinancing, while borrowers not experiencing property value appreciation are more likely to continue to require mortgage insurance at the time of refinancing or not qualify for refinancing at all (including if they have experienced economic difficulties) and thus remain subject to the mortgage insurance coverage.
The percentage of NIW on loans representing refinances was 7% for 2018, compared to 11% for 2017 and 20% for 2016. When a borrower refinances a mortgage loan insured by us by paying it off in full with the proceeds of a new mortgage that is also insured by us, the insurance on that existing mortgage is cancelled, and insurance on the new mortgage is considered to be NIW. Therefore, continuation of our coverage from a refinanced loan to a new loan results in both a cancellation of insurance and NIW. When a lender and borrower modify a loan rather than replace it with a new one, or enter into a new loan pursuant to a loan modification program, our insurance continues without being cancelled, assuming that we consent to the modification or new loan. As a result, such modifications or new loans, including those modified under HARP, are not included in our NIW.
In addition to varying with the coverage percentage, our premium rates for insurance have varied depending upon the perceived risk of a claim on the insured loan and thus taken into account, among other things, the LTV ratio, the borrower’s credit score and DTI ratio, whether the loan is a fixed payment loan or a non-fixed payment loan (a non-fixed payment loan is referred to in the home mortgage lending industry as an ARM), the number of borrowers the mortgage term and whether the property is the borrower’s primary residence. We generally utilized a national, rather than a regional or local, premium rate policy. However, depending upon regional economic conditions, we have made, and may make, changes to our underwriting requirements to implement more restrictive standards in certain markets and for loan characteristics that we categorize as higher risk. In the first quarter of 2019 we introduced MiQ™, our loan level pricing system that establishes our premium rates based on more risk attributes than were considered in 2018. Premium rates cannot be changed after the issuance of coverage. 
The borrower’s mortgage loan instrument may require the borrower to pay the mortgage insurance premium. Our industry refers to the related mortgage insurance as “borrower-paid.” If the borrower is not required to pay the premium and mortgage insurance is required in connection with the origination of the loan, then the premium is paid by the lender, who may recover the premium through an increase in the note rate on the mortgage or higher origination fees. Our industry refers to the related mortgage insurance as “lender-paid.” Most of our primary IIF is borrower-paid mortgage insurance.


There are several payment plans available to the borrower, or lender, as the case may be. Under the single premium plan, the borrower or lender pays us in advance a single payment covering a specified term exceeding twelve months. Under the monthly premium plan, the borrower or lender pays us a monthly premium payment to provide only one month of coverage. Under the annual premium plan, an annual premium is paid to us in advance, with annual renewal premiums paid in advance thereafter.
During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the single premium plan represented approximately 17%, 19% and 19%, respectively, of our NIW. The monthly premium plan represented approximately 83%, 81% and 81%, respectively. The annual premium plan represented less than 1% of NIW in each of those years. Depending on the actual life of a single premium policy and its premium rate relative to that of a monthly premium policy, a single premium policy may generate more or less premium than a monthly premium policy over its life.
Pool and Other Insurance. Pool insurance is generally used as an additional “credit enhancement” for certain secondary market mortgage transactions. Pool insurance generally covers the amount of the loss on a defaulted mortgage loan that exceeds the claim payment under the primary coverage, if primary insurance is required on that mortgage loan, as well as the total loss on a defaulted mortgage loan which did not require primary insurance. Pool insurance may have a stated aggregate loss limit for a pool of loans and may also have a deductible under which no losses are paid by the insurer until losses on the pool of loans exceed the deductible. As of December 31, 2018, less than 1% of our RIF was pool insurance. 
In connection with the GSEs' credit risk transfer programs, we provide insurance and reinsurance covering portions of the credit risk related to certain reference pools of mortgages acquired by the GSEs.

(1) | Includes fixed rate mortgages with temporary buydowns (where in effect, the applicable interest rate is typically reduced by one or two percentage points during the first two years of the loan), ARMs in which the initial interest rate is fixed for at least five years, and balloon payment mortgages (a loan with a maturity, typically five to seven years, that is shorter than the loan’s amortization period).


(2) | Includes ARMs where payments adjust fully with interest rate adjustments. Also includes pay option ARMs and other ARMs with negative amortization features, which collectively at December 31, 2018 and 2017, represented 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively, of primary RIF. As indicated in note (1), does not include ARMs in which the initial interest rate is fixed for at least five years. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, ARMs with LTV ratios in excess of 90% represented 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively, of primary RIF.


(3) | Loans within the conforming loan limit have an original principal balance that does not exceed the maximum original principal balance of loans that the GSEs will purchase. The conforming loan limit for one unit properties was $417,000 from 2007 through 2016, $424,100 for 2017, $453,100 for 2018 and $484,350 for 2019. The limit for high cost communities has been higher and is $726,525 for 2019. Non-conforming loans are loans with an original principal balance above the conforming loan limit. 


(4) | Includes cooperatives and manufactured homes deemed to be real estate.


(5) | Reduced documentation loans were originated prior to 2009 under programs in which there was a reduced level of verification or disclosure compared to traditional mortgage loan underwriting, including programs in which the borrower’s income and/or assets were disclosed


in the loan application but there was no verification of those disclosures ("stated" documentation) and programs in which there was no disclosure of income or assets in the loan application ("no" documentation). In accordance with industry practice, loans approved by GSE and other automated underwriting (AU) systems under “doc waiver” programs that did not require verification of borrower income are classified by us as “full documentation.” Based in part on information provided by the GSEs, we estimate full documentation loans of this type were approximately 4% of 2007 NIW. Information for other periods is not available. We understand these AU systems granted such doc waivers for loans they judged to have higher credit quality. We also understand that the GSEs terminated their “doc waiver” programs in the second half of 2008.

(6) | Represents the FICO score at loan origination. The weighted average “decision FICO score” at loan origination for NIW in 2018 and 2017 was 745. The FICO score for a loan with multiple borrowers is the lowest of the borrowers’ decision FICO scores. A borrower’s “decision FICO score” is determined as follows: if there are three FICO scores available, the middle FICO score is used; if two FICO scores are available, the lower of the two is used; if only one FICO score is available, it is used. A FICO score is a score based on a borrower’s credit history generated by a model developed by Fair Isaac Corporation.

OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
Contract Underwriting. A non-insurance subsidiary of ours performs contract underwriting services for lenders, underwriting loans to conform to prescribed guidelines. The guidelines might be the lender's own guidelines or the guidelines of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or a non-GSE investor. These services are provided for loans that require private mortgage insurance as well as for loans that do not require private mortgage insurance. 
Under our contract underwriting agreements, we may be required to provide certain remedies to our customers if certain standards relating to the quality of our underwriting work are not met, and we have an established reserve for such future obligations. The related contract underwriting remedy expense for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. Claims for remedies may be made a number of years after the underwriting work was performed.
Other. We provide various fee-based services for the mortgage finance industry, such as analysis of loan originations and portfolios, and mortgage lead generation.
We provide insurance and reinsurance related to certain mortgages under Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac credit risk transfer programs. The amount of risk associated with these transactions is currently $53 million.
REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS
Quota Share Transactions. At each of December 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 78% of our IIF was subject to quota share reinsurance transactions. In 2018, approximately 75% of our NIW was subject to quota share reinsurance transactions, compared to 84% in 2017.
We have in place QSR transactions with unaffiliated reinsurers that covers most of our insurance written from 2013 through 2018, and a portion of our insurance written prior to 2013. The structure of the transactions is a 30% quota share for all policies covered, with a 20% ceding commission as well as a profit commission. Generally, under the transactions, we will receive a profit commission provided that the loss ratio on the loans covered under the transactions remains below 60% (62% for the transaction covering 2018 NIW). We expect that in the first quarter of 2019, we will enter into a similar agreement covering most of our NIW in 2019, on terms no less favorable than our existing transactions. Although reinsuring against possible loan losses does not discharge us from liability to a policyholder, it reduces the amount of capital we are required to retain against potential future losses for PMIERs, rating agency and insurance regulatory purposes. The GSEs' approvals of the reinsurance transactions are subject to 


several conditions and the transactions will be reviewed under the PMIERs at least annually by the GSEs. We may not receive full credit under the PMIERs for the risk ceded under our quota share reinsurance transactions. 
Excess of Loss Transaction. On October 30, 2018, MGIC entered into a fully collateralized reinsurance agreement with an unaffiliated special purpose insurer that provides for up to $318.6 million of aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage on a portfolio of mortgage insurance policies with in force dates on or after July 1, 2016 and before January 1, 2018. MGIC will retain the first layer of $168.7 million of aggregate losses, and the reinsurer will then provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. The aggregate coverage decreases over a ten-year period as the underlying covered mortgages amortize, principal is prepaid or mortgage insurance losses are paid. For further information about our reinsurance agreements, including the Company's early termination rights, see Note 9 – “Reinsurance,” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 
CUSTOMERS
Originators of residential mortgage loans such as savings institutions, commercial banks, mortgage brokers, credit unions, mortgage bankers and other lenders have historically determined the placement of mortgage insurance written on a flow basis and as a result are our customers. To obtain primary insurance from us written on a flow basis, a mortgage lender must first apply for and receive a mortgage guaranty master policy from us. Our top 10 customers, none of whom represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenues, generated 24% of our NIW on a flow basis in 2018, compared to 23% in 2017 and 24% in 2016.  Our largest customer accounted for approximately 5%, 4% and 5% of our flow NIW in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our relationships with our customers could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including if our premium rates are higher than those of our competitors, our underwriting requirements result in our declining to insure some of the loans originated by our customers and our insurance policy rescissions and claim curtailments that affect the customer.  Information about some of the other factors that can affect a mortgage insurer’s relationship with its customers can be found in our risk factor titled “Competition or changes in our relationships with our customers could reduce our revenues, reduce our premium yields and/or increase our losses” in Item 1A.
SALES AND MARKETING AND COMPETITION
Sales and Marketing. Our employees sell our insurance products throughout all regions of the United States and in Puerto Rico and Guam.

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries
 | Glossary of terms and acronyms

Competition. Our competition includes other mortgage insurers, governmental agencies and products designed to eliminate the need to purchase private mortgage insurance. For flow business, we and other private mortgage insurers compete directly with federal and state governmental and quasi-governmental agencies, principally the FHA and the VA. The FHA, VA and USDA sponsor government-backed mortgage insurance programs, and it is estimated that during 2018, 2017 and 2016, they accounted for a combined approximately 56.8%, 61.4% and 63.9%, respectively, of the total low down payment residential mortgages which were subject to FHA, VA, USDA or primary private mortgage insurance. For more information about the market share of the FHA and the VA, see “Overview of the Private Mortgage Insurance Industry and its Operating Environment” above.
In addition to competition from the FHA, VA and USDA, we and other private mortgage insurers face competition from state-supported mortgage insurance funds in several states. From time to time, other state legislatures and agencies consider expanding the authority of their state governments to insure residential mortgages. 
The PMI industry is highly competitive. We believe that we currently compete with other private mortgage insurers based on premium rates, underwriting requirements, financial strength (including based on creditor financial strength ratings), customer relationships, name recognition, reputation, the strength of our management team and field organization, the ancillary products and services provided to lenders, and the effective use of technology and innovation in the delivery and servicing of our mortgage insurance products.
The U.S. PMI industry currently consists of six active mortgage insurers and their affiliates. The names of these mortgage insurers can be found in our risk factor titled “Competition or changes in our relationships with our customers could reduce our revenues, reduce our premium yields and/or increase our losses” in Item 1A. Until 2010, the PMI industry had not had new entrants in many years. Since 2010, two public companies have been formed and begun writing business and a worldwide insurer and reinsurer with mortgage insurance operations in Europe completed the purchase of two competitors. Our market share (as measured by NIW) was 17.4% in 2018, compared to 18.3% in 2017 and 17.9% in 2016, in each case excluding HARP refinances. (source: Inside Mortgage Finance).
If we are unable to compete effectively in the current or any future markets as a result of the financial strength ratings assigned to our insurance subsidiaries, our future new insurance written could be negatively affected. Substantially all of our insurance written since 2008 has been for loans purchased by the GSEs. The 


GSEs' current PMIERs do not require an insurer to maintain minimum financial strength ratings. However, depending on the evolution of housing finance reform, the level of issuances of non-GSE MBS may increase in the future. Financial strength ratings may be considered by issuers of non-GSE MBS in determining whether to purchase private mortgage insurance for loans supporting such securities. In assigning financial strength ratings, in addition to considering the adequacy of the mortgage insurer’s capital to withstand very high claim scenarios under assumptions determined by the rating agency, we believe rating agencies review a mortgage insurer’s historical and projected operating performance, franchise risk, business outlook, competitive position, management, corporate strategy, and other factors. The rating agency issuing the financial strength rating can withdraw or change its rating at any time. At the time that this annual report was finalized, the financial strength of MGIC was rated Baa2 (with a stable outlook) by Moody’s Investors Service, BBB+ (with a stable outlook) by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and A- (with a stable outlook) by A.M. Best. 
RISK MANAGEMENT
Enterprise Risk Management. The Company has an enterprise risk management (“ERM”) framework that it believes is commensurate with the size, nature and complexity of the Company’s business activities (all of which relate to insuring or reinsuring mortgage credit risk) and strategies. Among the key objectives of the ERM framework are to have a clear and well documented shared understanding, by senior management and the Board, of the Company’s risk management philosophy and overall appetite for risk, and that there are appropriate monitoring, management and reporting mechanisms to support the framework.
Risk Governance.  The Company maintains a Senior Management Oversight Committee (“SMOC”) that, at the management level, serves as its primary risk management governance organization. The SMOC seeks to maintain an enterprise-wide view of risk. The SMOC oversees the Company’s ERM framework; oversees the risks associated with strategic and business issues critical to the Company, monitoring the Company’s risk profile across the set of identified key risks (see “Risk Identification and Assessment” below); and supports the Risk Management Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (“RMC”). The SMOC, of which the CEO is a member, is chaired by the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, who is the principal management liaison to the RMC. 
Risk Management and Controls. The Company’s management of risk uses the “three lines of defense” model. The front-line business units, whose activities create inherent risk exposures, represent the “first line of defense.” Front-line business units are responsible for ensuring risks are taken and managed within the 


  MGIC Investment Corporation 2018 Form 10-K | 16

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries
 | Glossary of terms and acronyms

guidelines established by the Company’s Risk Management (“RM”) group. 
RM, along with the Company’s separate compliance program, comprise the “second line of defense” and are management and oversight functions that are primarily responsible for many aspects of the management of risk. RM is generally responsible for the ERM framework, for policies and metrics that dimension the risk tolerances of the Company’s business activities and for measurement and assessment of all key risks and reporting of those risks to the SMOC and the RMC.
Internal Audit forms the “third line of defense” and serves in an independent assurance capacity.  It reports to senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board regarding the effectiveness of the first and second lines of defense. Internal Audit is responsible for establishing a comprehensive audit plan that covers all functions and identified material risks of the Company, communication of any material deficiencies to the SMOC and the Audit Committee, and determining whether corrective actions fully remediate any noted deficiencies.
Risk Identification and Assessment. The Company completes an annual key risk identification and assessment process that is focused on identifying and assessing those risks with the potential to have the greatest impact on the Company’s ability to accomplish its strategic goals. These key risks include both risks that are, at least in part, internal to the Company (e.g., mortgage credit risk) and therefore, at least in part, within management’s direct control, as well as, risks that are external to the Company (e.g., business risk) and outside of management’s direct control. The results of the identification and assessment are reviewed and approved annually by both the SMOC and the RMC.
Risk Appetite.  The Company has established risk appetite statements for each of its key risks, as well as quantitative or qualitative metrics used as thresholds for dimensioning the risk appetite for each key risk. The resulting risk appetite statements and associated metrics are reviewed and approved annually by the SMOC and the RMC.
Risk Reporting and Communication. RM produces various analyses, reports and key risk indicators (“KRIs”) that are reported to the SMOC, the RMC and the Board quarterly.  For our largest risk exposure, mortgage credit risk, these KRIs include risk factors for the Company’s NIW, IIF, quality control and claim activity.  
Although the Company has in place the ERM framework discussed above, it may not be effective in identifying, or adequate in controlling or mitigating, the risks we face. For more information, see our Risk Factor titled "If our risk management programs are not effective in identifying, or adequate in controlling or mitigating, the risks we face, or if the models used in our businesses 


are inaccurate, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition" in Item 1A.
MORTGAGE CREDIT RISK 
We believe that mortgage credit risk is materially affected by:

• | the condition of the economy, including the direction of change in home prices and employment, in the area in which the property is located;


• | the borrower’s credit profile, including the borrower’s credit history, DTI ratio and cash reserves, and the willingness of a borrower with sufficient resources to make mortgage payments when the mortgage balance exceeds the value of the home;


• | the loan product, which encompasses the LTV ratio, the type of loan instrument, including whether the instrument provides for fixed or variable payments and the amortization schedule, the type of property and the purpose of the loan;


• | origination practices of lenders and the percentage of coverage on insured loans; and


• | the size of insured loans.

We believe that, excluding other factors, claim incidence increases:

• | during periods of economic contraction and home price depreciation, including when these conditions may not be nationwide, compared to periods of economic expansion and home price appreciation;


• | for loans to borrowers with lower FICO scores compared to loans to borrowers with higher FICO scores;


• | for loans to borrowers with higher DTI ratios compared to loans to borrowers with lower DTI ratios;


• | for loans with less than full underwriting documentation compared to loans with full underwriting documentation;


• | for loans with higher LTV ratios compared to loans with lower LTV ratios;


• | for ARMs when the reset interest rate significantly exceeds the interest rate at the time of loan origination;


• | for loans that permit the deferral of principal amortization compared to loans that require principal amortization with each monthly payment;

  MGIC Investment Corporation 2018 Form 10-K | 17

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries
 | Glossary of terms and acronyms


• | for loans in which the original loan amount exceeds the conforming loan limit compared to loans below that limit; and


• | for cash out refinance loans compared to rate and term refinance loans.

Other types of loan characteristics relating to the individual loan or borrower may also affect the risk potential for a loan. The presence of a number of higher-risk characteristics in a loan materially increases the likelihood of a claim on such a loan unless there are other characteristics to mitigate the risk.
We charge higher premium rates to reflect the increased risk of claim incidence that we perceive is associated with a loan. Not all higher risk characteristics are reflected in our premium rates; however, in the first quarter of 2019 we introduced MiQ™, our loan level pricing system that establishes our premium rates based on more risk attributes than were considered in 2018. There can be no assurance that our premium rates adequately reflect the increased risk, particularly in a period of economic recession, high unemployment, slowing home price appreciation or home price declines. For additional information, see our risk factors in Item 1A, including the one titled “The premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for our liabilities for losses and as a result any inadequacy could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.”
Underwriting Insurance Applications. Applications for mortgage insurance are submitted to us through both our delegated and non-delegated options. Under the delegated option, applications are submitted to us electronically and we rely upon the lender’s representations and warranties that the data submitted is true, accurate and consistent with the documents in the lender's loan origination file, when making our insurance decision. If the loan data submitted meets the underwriting requirements, a commitment to insure the loan is immediately issued. If the requirements are not met, the loan is reviewed by one of our underwriters. Non-delegated applications are submitted with documents from the lender’s loan origination file. During loan set-up, data is entered from those application documents and electronically evaluated against our 


underwriting requirements. An internally generated feedback report guides the mortgage insurance review as a full review of the mortgage documents is performed by one of our underwriters. If the loan meets the underwriting requirements, a commitment to insure the loan is issued. 
Beginning in 2013, we aligned most of our underwriting requirements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for loans that receive and are processed in accordance with certain approval recommendations from a GSE automated underwriting system. Our underwriting requirements are available on our website at http://www.mgic.com/underwriting/index.html. Our underwriters are authorized to approve loans that do not meet all of our underwriting requirements provided appropriate offsetting factors can be identified.
EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHIC LOSSES; DELINQUENCIES; CLAIMS; LOSS MITIGATION
Exposure to Catastrophic Losses. The PMI industry experienced catastrophic losses in the mid-to-late 1980s, similar to the losses we experienced in 2007-2013. For background information about such losses in 2007-2013, refer to “General – Overview of Private Mortgage Insurance Industry and its Operating Environment” above.
Delinquencies. The claim cycle on PMI generally begins with the insurer’s receipt of notification of a delinquency on an insured loan from the loan servicer. We consider a loan to be delinquent when it is two or more payments past due. Most servicers report delinquent loans to us within this two month period. The incidence of delinquency is affected by a variety of factors, including the level of borrower income growth, unemployment, health issues, family status, the level of interest rates, rates of home price appreciation or depreciation and general borrower creditworthiness. Delinquencies that are not cured result in a claim to us. See “– Claims.” Delinquencies may be cured by the borrower bringing current the delinquent loan payments or by a sale of the property and the satisfaction of all amounts due under the mortgage. In addition, when a policy is rescinded or a claim is denied we remove the loan from our delinquency inventory.

Different geographical areas may experience different delinquency rates due to varying localized economic conditions from year to year and the amount of time it takes for foreclosures to be completed for uncured delinquencies. The following table shows the percentage of primary loans we insured that were delinquent as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 for the 15 jurisdictions for which we paid the most claims during 2018.

Jurisdiction delinquency rates

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016

All other jurisdictions | 2.6 | | | 3.3 | | 4.2 | 

Note: Asterisk denotes jurisdictions in the table above that predominantly use a judicial foreclosure process, which generally increases the amount of time for a foreclosure to be completed.


We believe the increase in delinquency rates from 2016 to 2017 in Florida, Puerto Rico and Texas reflect the impact of the 2017 hurricanes experienced in those areas. Based on our analysis and past experience, we do not expect the 2017 hurricane activity to result in a material increase in our incurred losses or paid claims. 

The primary delinquency inventory in those same jurisdictions as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 appears in a table found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Consolidated Results of Operations – Losses and expenses – Loss Reserves,” in Item 7.
Claims. Claims result from delinquencies that are not cured or a short sale that we approve. Whether a claim results from an uncured delinquency depends, in large part, on the borrower’s equity in the home at the time of delinquency, the borrower’s or the lender’s ability to sell the home for an amount sufficient to satisfy all amounts due under the mortgage and the willingness and ability of the borrower and lender to enter into a loan modification that provides for a cure of the delinquency. Various factors affect the frequency and amount of claims, including local home prices and employment levels, and interest rates. If a delinquency goes to claim, any premium collected from the time of delinquency to the time of claim payment is returned to the servicer along with the claim payment.
Under the terms of our master policy, the lender is required to file a claim for primary insurance with us within 60 days after it has acquired title to the underlying property (typically through foreclosure). For the past several years, the average time it took to receive a claim associated with a delinquency increased significantly from our historical experience of approximately twelve months, in part, due to new loss mitigation protocols established by servicers and to changes in some state foreclosure laws that may include, for example, a requirement for additional review and/or mediation processes. Recently, the average time 


  MGIC Investment Corporation 2018 Form 10-K | 19

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries
 | Glossary of terms and acronyms

for servicers to process foreclosures has decreased, which has reduced the average time to receive a claim associated with new delinquent notices that do not cure. It is difficult to estimate how long it may take for current and future delinquencies that do not cure to develop into paid claims.
Within 60 days after a claim has been filed and all documents required to be submitted to us have been delivered, we have the option of either (1) paying the coverage percentage specified for that loan, with the insured retaining title to the underlying property and receiving all proceeds from the eventual sale of the property (we have elected this option for the vast majority of claim payments in the recent past), or (2) paying 100% of the claim amount in exchange for the lender’s conveyance to us of good and marketable title to the property. After we receive title to a property, we sell it for our own account. If we fail to pay a claim timely, we would be subject to additional interest expense.
Claim activity is not evenly spread throughout the coverage period of a book of primary business. Relatively few claims are typically received during the first two years following issuance of coverage on a loan. This is typically followed by a period of rising claims which, based on industry experience, has historically reached its highest level in the third and fourth years after the year of loan origination. Thereafter, the number of claims typically received has historically declined at a gradual rate, although the rate of decline can be affected by conditions in the economy, including slowing home price appreciation or home price depreciation. Moreover, when a loan is refinanced, because the new loan replaces, and is a continuation of, an earlier loan, the pattern of claims frequency for that new loan may be different from the historical pattern for other loans. Persistency, the condition of the economy, including unemployment, and other factors can affect the pattern of claim activity. For example, a weak economy can lead to claims from older books of business increasing, continuing at stable levels or experiencing a lower rate of decline. As of December 31, 2018, 59% of our primary RIF was written subsequent to December 31, 2015, 70% of our primary RIF was written subsequent to December 31, 2014, and 76% of our primary RIF was written subsequent to December 31, 2013. See “Our Products and Services – Mortgage Insurance – Primary Insurance In Force and Risk In Force by Policy Year” above.
Another important factor affecting MGIC Book losses is the amount of the average claim size, which is generally referred to as claim severity. The main determinants of claim severity are the amount of the mortgage loan, the coverage percentage on the loan, loss mitigation efforts and local market conditions. For information about our primary average claim paid, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Consolidated Results of Operations – Net Losses and LAE Paid,” in Item 7.


Net losses paid and primary losses paid for the top 15 jurisdictions and all other jurisdictions for 2018, 2017 and 2016 appear in tables found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Consolidated Results of Operations – Losses and expenses – Net Losses and LAE Paid,” in Item 7.
Loss Mitigation.
Before paying a claim, we review the loan and servicing files to determine the appropriateness of the claim amount. Our insurance policies generally provide that we can reduce or deny a claim if the servicer did not comply with its obligations under our insurance policy, including the requirement to mitigate our loss by performing reasonable loss mitigation efforts or, for example, diligently pursuing a foreclosure or bankruptcy relief in a timely manner. We call such reduction of claims submitted to us “curtailments.” In each of 2018 and 2017, curtailments reduced our average claim paid by approximately 5.8% and 5.6%, respectively.
When reviewing the loan file associated with a claim, we may determine that we have the right to rescind coverage on the loan. In our SEC reports, we refer to insurance rescissions and denials of claims as “rescissions” and variations of this term. The circumstances in which we are entitled to rescind coverage narrowed under more restrictive policy terms beginning in 2012. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 82% of our IIF was written under the more restrictive terms. We expect a new version of our master policy, containing more restrictive terms to be effective for business beginning in the third or fourth quarter of 2019. For more information, see our Risk Factor titled "The mix of business we write affects our Minimum Required Assets under the PMIERs, our premium yields and the likelihood of losses occurring" in Item 1A. In recent quarters, an immaterial percentage of claims 
received in a quarter have been resolved by rescissions. We do not expect future rescissions will be a significant portion of the claims we resolve over the next few years.
Our loss reserving methodology incorporates our estimates of future rescissions, curtailments, and reversals of rescissions and curtailments. When we rescind coverage, we return all premiums previously paid to us under the policy and are relieved of our obligation to pay a claim under the policy. A variance between ultimate actual rescission, curtailment or reversal rates and our estimates, as a result of the outcome of litigation, settlements or other factors, could materially affect our losses.
When the insured disputes our right to rescind coverage or curtail a claim, we generally engage in discussions in an attempt to settle the dispute. If we are unable to reach a settlement, the outcome of a dispute ultimately may be determined by legal proceedings. Under ASC 450-20, until a liability associated with settlement discussions or legal proceedings becomes probable and

 | Glossary of terms and acronyms

can be reasonably estimated, we consider our claim payment or rescission resolved for financial reporting purposes and do not accrue an estimated loss. Where we have determined that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we have recorded our best estimate of our probable loss. 
In addition to matters for which we have recorded a probable loss, we are involved in other discussions and/or proceedings with insureds with respect to our claims paying practices. Although it is reasonably possible that when these matters are resolved we will not prevail in all cases, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate or range of estimates of the potential liability. We estimate the maximum exposure associated with matters where a loss is reasonably possible to be approximately $279 million, although we believe (but can give no assurance that) we will ultimately resolve these matters for significantly less than this amount. This estimate of our maximum exposure does not include interest or consequential or exemplary damages.
Although loan modification programs continued to mitigate our losses in 2018, their impact has decreased significantly from the impact we experienced in 2008-2012.
LOSS RESERVES 
A significant period of time typically elapses between the time when a borrower becomes delinquent on a mortgage payment, which is the event triggering a potential future claim payment by us, the reporting of the delinquency to us, the acquisition of the property by the lender (typically through foreclosure) or the sale of the property with our approval, and the eventual payment of the claim related to the uncured delinquency or a rescission. To recognize the estimated liability for losses related to outstanding reported delinquencies, or delinquency inventory, we establish loss reserves.  Loss reserves are established by estimating the number of loans in our delinquency inventory that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as the claim rate, and further estimating the amount of the claim payment, which is referred to as claim severity. Our loss reserve estimates are established based upon historical experience, including rescission and curtailment activity. In accordance with GAAP for the mortgage insurance industry, we generally do not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans that are not currently delinquent.
We also establish reserves to provide for the estimated costs of settling claims, general expenses of administering the claims settlement process, legal fees and other fees (“loss adjustment expenses”), and for losses and loss adjustment expenses from delinquencies that have occurred, but which have not yet been reported to us.


Our reserving process bases our estimates of future events on our past experience. However, estimation of loss reserves is inherently judgmental and conditions that have affected the development of the loss reserves in the past may not necessarily affect development patterns in the future, in either a similar manner or degree. For further information, see our risk factors in Item 1A, including the ones titled “Because we establish loss reserves only upon a loan delinquency rather than based on estimates of our ultimate losses on risk in force, losses may have a disproportionate adverse effect on our earnings in certain periods,” and “Because loss reserve estimates are subject to uncertainties, paid claims may be substantially different than our loss reserves.”
Our losses incurred from our RIF have declined in recent years in part due to the improving economy, the run-off of the insurance policies we wrote before the financial crisis and the credit quality of insurance policies written since the financial crisis. These factors resulted in fewer delinquent loans, as well as an improved cure rate on delinquent loans. Our losses incurred were $36.6 million in 2018, compared to $53.7 million in 2017 and $240.2 million in 2016. For information about the decrease in losses incurred from 2016 to 2018, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Consolidated Results of Operations – Losses and expenses – Losses incurred, net,” in Item 7.
C. Investment Portfolio
POLICY AND STRATEGY
At December 31, 2018, the fair value of our investment portfolio was approximately $5.2 billion. In addition, at December 31, 2018, our total assets included approximately $152 million of cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2018, approximately $248 million of investments and cash and cash equivalents was held by our parent company, and the remainder was held by our subsidiaries, primarily MGIC.
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 77% of our investment portfolio (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was managed by Wellington Management Company, LLP, although we maintain overall control of investment policy and strategy. We maintain direct management of the remainder of our investment portfolio. Unless otherwise indicated, the remainder of the discussion regarding our investment portfolio refers to our investment portfolio only and not to cash and cash equivalents.
The investment policy of our operating companies (primarily MGIC) emphasizes preservation of PMIERs assets, limiting portfolio volatility and maximizing total return with an emphasis on yield (subject to the other objectives). Our holding company investment policy emphasizes providing liquidity with minimal realized losses through holding high credit quality, low volatility

assets. Consequently, our investment portfolio consists almost entirely of high-quality, investment grade, fixed income securities. Our investment portfolio strategy considers tax efficiency. The mix of tax-exempt municipal securities in our investment portfolio will be dependent upon their value, relative to taxable equivalent securities, determined in part by federal statutory tax rates. Our investment policies and strategies are subject to change depending upon regulatory, economic and market conditions and our existing or anticipated financial condition and operating requirements.
Our investment policies in effect at December 31, 2018 limit investments in the securities of a single issuer, other than the U.S. government, and generally limit the purchase of fixed income securities to those that are rated investment grade by at least one rating agency. They also limit the amount of investment in foreign governments and foreign domiciled securities and in any individual foreign country. In addition, the guidelines require maintenance of weighted average credit quality of at least an "A" rating.
The aggregate market value of the holdings of a single obligor, or type of investment, as applicable, is limited to:

U.S. government and GNMA securities | No limit 
Pre-refunded municipals escrowed in Treasury securities | No limit 
Individual U.S. government agencies(1) | 10% of portfolio market value
Individual securities rated “AAA” or “AA” (2) | 3% of portfolio market value 
Individual securities rated “BBB” or “A” (2) | 2% of portfolio market value 
Foreign governments & foreign domiciled securities (in total) (3) | 20% of portfolio market value


(1) | As used with respect to our investment portfolio, U.S. government agencies include all GSEs and Federal Home Loan Banks.


(2) | For the holding company, individual securities with a rating of "AA" or "AAA" may represent a maximum 10% of the portfolio market value and individual securities with a rating of "BBB" or "A" may represent a maximum 5%.


(3) | For the holding company, there is no maximum aggregate limit for foreign government or foreign domiciled securities.

For information about the credit ratings of securities in our investment portfolio, see "Balance Sheet Review" in Item 7.


Investment Operations
At December 31, 2018, the sectors of our investment portfolio were as shown in the table below:

Investment portfolio - sectors | 
 | Percentage of Portfolio’s Fair Value
1. Corporate | 47% 
2. Tax-Exempt Municipals | 22 
3. Asset-Backed | 14 
4. Taxable Municipals | 11 
5. U.S. government and agency debt | 3 
6. GNMA and other agency mortgage-backed securities | 3 
 | 100% 

We had no derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. Securities with stated maturities due within up to one year, after one year and up to five years, after five years and up to ten years, and after ten years, represented 9%, 32%, 19% and 23%, respectively, of the total fair value of our investment in fixed income debt securities. Asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities are not included in these maturity categories as the expected maturities may be different from the stated maturities depending on the periodic payments during the life of the security. Asset-backed securities represent 14% of the investment portfolio (CLOs represent 6%, CMBS represent 5% and other asset-backed securities securities represent 3%). GNMA and other agency mortgage-backed securities represent 3% of the investment portfolio. Our pre-tax yield was 3.1%, 2.7% and 2.6% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and our after-tax yield was 2.6%, 2.0% and 1.9% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Our ten largest holdings at December 31, 2018 appear in the table below:

D. Regulation 
Direct Regulation
We are subject to comprehensive, detailed regulation by state insurance departments. These regulations are principally designed for the protection of our insured policyholders, rather than for the benefit of investors. Although their scope varies, state insurance laws generally grant broad supervisory powers to agencies or officials to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business. 
In general, regulation of our subsidiaries’ businesses relates to:

• | licenses to transact businesses;


• | policy forms;


• | premium rates;


• | insurable loans;


• | annual and other reports on financial condition;


• | the basis upon which assets and liabilities must be stated;


• | requirements regarding contingency reserves equal to 50% of premiums earned;


• | minimum capital levels and adequacy ratios;


• | reinsurance requirements;


• | limitations on the types of investment instruments which may be held in an investment portfolio;


• | privacy;


• | deposits of securities;


• | transactions among affiliates;


• | cybersecurity


• | limits on dividends payable;


• | suitability of officers and directors; and


• | claims handling.

Wisconsin has adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Act, which requires, among other things, that we:

• | no less than annually, conduct an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ("ORSA") to assess the material risks associated with our business and our current and estimated projected future solvency position;


• | maintain a risk management framework to assess, monitor, manage and report on material risks;


• | provide a confidential high-level ORSA Summary Report annually to the OCI; and


• | Provide an Enterprise Risk Management Report annually to the OCI.

The insurance laws of 16 jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, our domiciliary state, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to the RIF (or a similar measure) in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. We refer to these requirements as the “State Capital Requirements.” While they vary among jurisdictions, currently the most common State Capital Requirements allow for a maximum risk-to-capital ratio of 25 to 1. Wisconsin does not regulate capital by using a risk-to-capital measure but instead requires a minimum policyholder position. The “policyholder position” of a mortgage insurer is its net worth or surplus, contingency reserve and a portion of the reserves for unearned premiums. 
At December 31, 2018, MGIC’s risk-to-capital ratio was 9.0 to 1, below the maximum allowed by the jurisdictions with State Capital Requirements, and its policyholder position was $2.6 billion above the required MPP of $1.3 billion.
The NAIC plans to revise the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers that are provided for in its Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act. A working group of state regulators has been considering since 2016 a risk-based framework to establish capital requirements for mortgage insurers, although no date has been established by which the NAIC must propose revisions to the capital requirements. See our risk factors “We may not continue to meet the GSEs’ mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease as we are required to maintain significantly more capital in order to maintain our eligibility” and “State Capital requirements may prevent us from continuing to write new insurance on an uninterrupted basis” in Item 1A, for information about regulations governing our capital adequacy and our expectations regarding our future capital position. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Adequacy" in Item 7 for information about our current capital position.
Most states also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their parents or affiliates and have restrictions on transactions that have the effect of inducing lenders to place business with the insurer. For a description of limits on dividends payable to us from MGIC, see Note 14 – “Statutory Information,” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

Mortgage insurance premium rates are also subject to state regulation to protect policyholders against the adverse effects of excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates and to encourage competition in the insurance marketplace. Any increase in premium rates must be justified, generally on the basis of the insurer’s loss experience, expenses and future trend analysis. The general mortgage default experience may also be considered. Premium rates are subject to review and challenge by state regulators. 
We are required to establish statutory accounting contingency loss reserves in an amount equal to 50% of net earned premiums. These amounts cannot be withdrawn for a period of 10 years, except as permitted by insurance regulations. With regulatory approval a mortgage guaranty insurance company may make early withdrawals from the contingency reserve when incurred losses exceed 35% of net premiums earned in a calendar year. For further information, see Note 14 – “Statutory Information,” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
Mortgage insurers are generally single-line companies, restricted to writing residential mortgage insurance business only. Although we, as an insurance holding company, are prohibited from engaging in certain transactions with MGIC or our other insurance subsidiaries without submission to and, in some instances, prior approval by applicable insurance departments, we are not subject to insurance company regulation on our non-insurance businesses.
Wisconsin’s insurance regulations generally provide that no person may acquire control of us unless the transaction in which control is acquired has been approved by the OCI. The regulations provide for a rebuttable presumption of control when a person owns or has the right to vote more than 10% of the voting securities. In addition, the insurance regulations of other states in which MGIC is licensed require notification to the state’s insurance department a specified time before a person acquires control of us. If regulators in these states disapprove the change of control, our licenses to conduct business in the disapproving states could be terminated. For further information about regulatory proceedings applicable to us and our industry, see “We are involved in legal proceedings and are subject to the risk of additional legal proceedings in the future” in Item 1A.
The CFPB was established by the Dodd-Frank Act to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products or services under federal law. The CFPB’s rules implementing laws that require mortgage lenders to make ability-to-pay determinations prior to extending credit affect the characteristics of loans being originated and the volume of loans available to be insured. We are uncertain whether the CFPB will issue any other rules or regulations that affect our business. 


Such rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us.
As the most significant purchasers and sellers of conventional mortgage loans and beneficiaries of private mortgage insurance, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae impose financial and other requirements on private mortgage insurers in order for them to be eligible to insure loans sold to the GSEs (these requirements are referred to as the "PMIERs", as discussed above). These requirements are subject to change from time to time. Based on our interpretation of the financial requirements of the PMIERs, as of December 31, 2018, MGIC’s Available Assets totaled $4.8 billion, or $1.4 billion in excess of its Minimum Required Assets. MGIC is in compliance with the requirements of the PMIERs and eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. If MGIC ceases to be eligible to insure loans purchased by one or both of the GSEs, it would significantly reduce the volume of our new business writings. For information about matters that could negatively affect our compliance with the PMIERs, see our risk factor titled “We may not continue to meet the GSEs’ mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease as we are required to maintain significantly more capital in order to maintain our eligibility” in Item 1A.
Revised PMIERs were published in September 2018 and will become effective March 31, 2019. If the revised PMIERs had been effective as of December 31, 2018, we estimate that MGIC’s pro forma excess of Available Assets over Minimum Required Assets would have been approximately $1 billion. The decrease in the pro forma excess from the reported excess of $1.4 billion is primarily due to the elimination of any credit for future premiums that had previously been allowed for certain insurance policies.
The FHFA is the conservator of the GSEs and has the authority to control and direct their operations. The increased role that the federal government has assumed in the residential mortgage market through the GSE conservatorship may increase the likelihood that the business practices of the GSEs change, including through administrative action, in ways that have a material adverse effect on us and that the charters of GSEs are changed by new federal legislation. In the past, members of Congress introduced several bills intended to scale back the GSEs; however, no legislation has been enacted. The Administration issued a June 2018 report indicating that the conservatorship of the GSEs should end and that the GSEs should transition to fully private entities, competing on a level playing field with private issuers of mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") (such issuers, collectively with the GSEs, referred to in the report as the "guarantors"). The report further indicated that a federal entity should regulate the guarantors, including their capital adequacy, and that guarantors should have access to an explicit federal guarantee on the MBS that is exposed only after substantial losses 


  MGIC Investment Corporation 2018 Form 10-K | 24

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries
 | Glossary of terms and acronyms

are incurred by the private market, including the guarantors. It is unclear whether and when that would occur and how that would impact us. As a result of the matters referred to above, it is uncertain what role the GSEs, FHA and private capital, including private mortgage insurance, will play in the domestic residential housing finance system in the future or the impact of any such changes on our business. In addition, the timing of the impact of any resulting changes on our business is uncertain. Most meaningful changes would require Congressional action to implement and it is difficult to estimate when Congressional action would be final and how long any associated phase-in period may last. For additional information about the potential impact that any such changes in the GSE’s roles may have on us, see the risk factor titled “Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses” in Item 1A.
In December 2013, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Federal Insurance Office released a report that calls for federal standards and oversight for mortgage insurers to be developed and implemented. It is uncertain if and when the standards and oversight will become effective and what form they will take.
Indirect Regulation
We are also indirectly, but significantly, impacted by regulations affecting purchasers of mortgage loans, such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and regulations affecting governmental insurers, such as the FHA and the VA, and lenders. See our risk factor titled “Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses” in Item 1A for a discussion of how potential changes in the GSEs’ business practices could affect us. Private mortgage insurers, including MGIC, are highly dependent upon federal housing legislation and other laws and regulations to the extent they affect the demand for private mortgage insurance and the housing market generally. From time to time, those laws and regulations have been amended in ways that affect competition from government agencies. Proposals are discussed from time to time by Congress and certain federal agencies to reform or modify the FHA and the Government National Mortgage Association, which securitizes mortgages insured by the FHA.
Subject to certain exceptions, in general, RESPA prohibits any person from giving or receiving any “thing of value” pursuant to an agreement or understanding to refer settlement services. 
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have uniform guidelines on real estate lending by insured lending institutions under their 


supervision. The guidelines specify that a residential mortgage loan originated with a loan-to-value ratio of 90% or greater should have appropriate credit enhancement in the form of mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral, although no depth of coverage percentage is specified in the guidelines.
Lenders are subject to various laws, including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the Fair Housing Act, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are subject to various laws, including laws relating to government sponsored enterprises, which may impose obligations or create incentives for increased lending to low and moderate income persons, or in targeted areas.
There can be no assurance that other federal laws and regulations affecting these institutions and entities will not change, or that new legislation or regulations will not be adopted which will adversely affect the private mortgage insurance industry. In this regard, see the risk factor titled “Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses” in Item 1A.
E. Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had 793 full- and part-time employees, approximately 34% of whom were assigned to our field offices. The number of employees given above does not include “on-call” employees. The number of “on-call” employees can vary substantially, primarily as a result of changes in demand for contract underwriting services. In recent years, the number of “on-call” employees has ranged from fewer than 40 to more than 110.
F. Website Access
We make available, free of charge, through our Internet website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The address of our website is http://mtg.mgic.com, and such reports and amendments are accessible through the “Reports & Filings” link at such address. The inclusion of our website address in this report is an inactive textual reference only and is not intended to include or incorporate by reference the information on our website into this report.
