 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” and “our company” refer to Medalist Diversified REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, including Medalist Diversified Holdings, LP, a Delaware limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner, except where it is clear from the context that the term only means Medalist Diversified REIT, Inc.
Overview
 
Medalist Diversified REIT, Inc. was formed in 2015 as a Maryland corporation, to acquire, reposition, renovate, lease and manage income-producing properties, with a primary focus on (i) commercial properties, including flex-industrial, and retail properties, and (ii) multi-family residential properties. We invest primarily in properties across secondary and tertiary markets in the southeastern part of the United States, with a concentration in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Alabama. Beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2017, we believe that we have operated in a manner qualifying us as a REIT, and we have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We are externally managed and advised by Medalist Fund Manager, Inc., a Virginia corporation, or our Manager. Our Manager makes all investment decisions for us. Our Manager is owned fifty percent each by Mr. Bill Elliott and Mr. Tim Messier, who are co-Presidents thereof.
 
We operate as an UPREIT, and own our properties through our subsidiary, Medalist Diversified Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. We may also pursue other real estate-related investments, including but not limited to equity or other ownership interests in entities that are the direct or indirect owners of real property, or indirect investments in real property, such as those that may be obtained in a joint venture. We anticipate that any such equity or joint venture investments to be in controlling interests in such entities. While we do not intend for these types of investments to be a primary focus, we may make such investments in our Manager’s sole discretion. We refer to our investments in real property and our real estate-related investments, collectively, as Investments.
 
Our company currently has three Investments: (i) the Shops at Franklin Square, a 134,239 square foot retail property located at 3940 East Franklin Boulevard in Gastonia, North Carolina 28056, or the Franklin Square Property, which we acquired on April 28, 2017, (ii) an undivided 64% tenant-in-common interest in the property commonly referred to as the Greensboro Airport Hampton Inn located at 7802 National Service Road in Greensboro, North Carolina, or the Greensboro Hampton Inn, which we acquired on November 3, 2017, and (iii) an undivided 84% tenant-in-common interest in the Shops at Hanover Square North, consisting of two parcels of land containing a 73,440 square foot retail center located at 7230 Bell Creek Road in Mechanicsville, Virginia 23111, or Hanover Square North, which we acquired on May 8, 2018.
 
Our principal objectives include sourcing value-add Investments in markets in which we maintain deep industry relationships and local market knowledge, and the creation of value for stockholders by utilizing our relationships and local knowledge of commercial real estate investment, management and disposition. There is, however, no assurance that any of these objectives will be achieved.

We may make Investments in properties owned by unaffiliated third parties, our Manager, or affiliates of our Manager, as determined by our Manager in its sole discretion.
 
Management
 
Our Manager and its affiliated companies specialize in acquiring, developing, owning and managing value-added commercial real estate in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions. Through their prior experience in the real estate industry, our Manager’s principals and their respective affiliates have developed a strong network of relationships with real estate owners, investors, operators and developers of all sizes and investment formats, across the United States and have a track record of success. We intend to leverage this experience to gain access to and identify suitable Investments, located across secondary and tertiary markets throughout the southeastern part of the United States, primarily in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Alabama. We do not anticipate making Investments outside of the United States.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe the experience of our Manager and its affiliates, which we refer to as the Medalist companies, as well as our investment strategies, distinguish us from other real estate companies. Specifically, our competitive strengths include the following:

§ | Experienced and Dedicated Management Team. The Medalist companies consist of a committed management team with experience in all phases of commercial real estate investment, management and disposition. The Medalist management team has 50+ years combined experience in commercial real estate and fixed income capital markets. The Medalist management team has also established a robust infrastructure of service providers, including longstanding relationships with two fully-staffed property managers for assets under management.

§ | Strong Investment Track Record. Our Manager and its affiliates have a strong track record of success. The Medalist companies have acquired and managed an over $152 million commercial real estate portfolio since 2003. Medalist Fund I, LLC, our Manager’s first multi-property investment fund, invested in three properties, representing retail, flex-industrial and multifamily. Those properties were sold in May of 2017, August of 2017, and January of 2018. Medalist Fund I, LLC, paid out its required 8% annualized cash distribution in each consecutive quarter (Q3 of 2013 through Q1 of 2018) out of operating cash flow and paid distributions resulting from the sales of the properties. After taking into account all contributions to and distributions from Medalist Fund I, LLC, Medalist Fund I, LLC had a fund-level IRR of 12.8%.

Competition
 
We are subject to significant competition in seeking real estate investments and tenants. We compete with many third parties engaged in real estate investment activities including other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, hedge funds, governmental bodies and other entities. We also face competition from other real estate investment programs, for investments that may be suitable for us. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may have substantially more operating experience than either us or our Manager. They also may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital.

Environmental Matters
 
As the owner of the buildings on our properties, we could face liability for the presence of hazardous materials (e.g., asbestos or lead) or other adverse conditions (e.g., poor indoor air quality) in our buildings. Environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of hazardous materials in buildings, and if we do not comply with such laws, it could face fines for such noncompliance. Also, we could be liable to third parties (e.g., occupants of the buildings) for damages related to exposure to hazardous materials or adverse conditions in our buildings, and we could incur material expenses with respect to abatement or remediation of hazardous materials or other adverse conditions in our buildings. In addition, some of our tenants routinely handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties, which are subject to regulation. Such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject us or our tenants to liability resulting from these activities. Environmental liabilities could affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us, and changes in laws could increase the potential liability for noncompliance. This may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations. We are not aware of any material contingent liabilities, regulatory matters or environmental matters that may exist.
Staffing
 
We are externally managed by our Manager pursuant to a management agreement. We do not have any employees and our executive officers are employed by our Manager. Our properties are managed by third party property management companies with whom our Manager contracts.
Available Information
 
We electronically file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports with the SEC. Copies of our filings with the SEC may be obtained from the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov, or downloaded from our website at www.medalistreit.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material has been filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Access to these filings is free of charge.
