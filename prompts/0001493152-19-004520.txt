Vislink
 
The Company originally announced the acquisition of Vislink on October 20, 2016 in a $16 million binding asset purchase agreement. On February 2, 2017, Vislink Technologies completed the acquisition of the net assets that constituted the business of Vislink pursuant to an asset purchase agreement by and among the Company, Vislink PLC, an England and Wales registered limited company (the “Guarantor”), Vislink International Limited, an England and Wales registered limited liability company (the “U.K. Seller”), and Vislink Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “U.S. Seller,” and together with the U.K. Seller, the “Sellers”), dated December 16, 2016, as amended on January 13, 2017.Vislink specializes in the wireless capture, delivery and management of secure, high-quality, live video from the field to the point of usage. Vislink designs and manufactures products encompassing microwave radio components, satellite communication, cellular and wireless camera systems, and associated amplifier items.
 
Vislink serves two core markets: (i) broadcast & media and (ii) law enforcement, public safety and surveillance. In the broadcast and media market, Vislink provides broadcast communication links for the collection of live news and sports and entertainment events. Customers in this market include national broadcasters, multi-channel broadcasters, network owners and station groups, sports and live broadcasters and hosted service providers. In the law enforcement, public safety and surveillance market, Vislink provides secure video communications and mission-critical solutions for law enforcement, defense and homeland security applications. Its law enforcement, public safety and surveillance customers include metropolitan, regional and national law enforcement agencies, as well as domestic and international defense agencies and organizations. Across its core markets, Vislink is also a leading global manufacturer of satellite communication services, with solutions destined for use in both fixed installations and small, rapidly-deployable configurations.
 
In 2017, we merged Vislink’s product offerings and operations with those of IMT into Vislink Technologies. We have completed the co-branding of IMT and Vislink, while still preserving the Vislink brand and its legacy brands, including Gigawave, Link, Advent and MRC, in markets where strong brand identification still exists. IMT has assumed the Vislink product warranties and support for all the Vislink and IMT product offerings. Vislink’s business in the Americas has become part of IMT, the legacy xG technology business was curtailed as part of the cost reduction initiatives.
 
Cost Reduction Initiatives
 
The Company completed a cost reduction plan announced in April 2018 that resulted in approximately $8.2 million in annual savings. Savings were realized through immediate cost reductions by eliminating certain personnel costs, associated benefits and reduction in facilities and other expenses. Specifically, the Company eliminated 65 full-time and contracted positions from the business, with salary and benefits savings totaling $7.3 million. The Company also removed $900,000 in non-labor costs from the business.
 
The Company has also identified an additional $1.3 million in additional savings, primary related to facilities consolidation and severance. This includes consolidating the two sites in Colchester, U.K. into one, expected to be completed by April 2019 and the expected savings are approximately $0.5 million through June 2020. Although no assurance can be provided the Company will successfully consolidate these two locations. As part of cost cutting measures, the Company will not be renewing office or warehouse space it currently leases in Sunrise, Florida with the lease expiring May 13, 2019.

Our Strategy
 
Our acquisitions of IMT and Vislink are now operating as brands of Vislink Technologies, Inc. After the completion of our cost reduction initiatives in 2018, the plan going forward is to diversify and grow the business in the following industries: broadcast and media, sports and entertainment and public safety, surveillance and defense. These industries allow us to offer a broad array of end-to-end, high-reliability, high-data rate, long-range wireless video transmission solutions. Our solutions are being used for applications in growing market segments, including in-game sports video mobile feeds, real-time capture and display of footage from drones and other aerial platforms, and rapid-response electronic news gathering operations.
 
The key sector strategies for IMT and Vislink are to expand the various markets for existing miniature wireless video products, which include the educational sector, videographers, and video service providers, provide complete end-to-end solutions for the video surveillance market, and introduce complete end-to-end IP technology into the broadcast and media market.
 
The acquisition of Vislink offered the Company the opportunity to realize synergies with its IMT business unit, while allowing both entities to offer an expanded suite of services and product offerings in the markets they are already active in. A key advantage is that there was limited overlap in product offerings, sales channels and market coverage between the two companies. For example, Vislink had a substantial client base in international markets where IMT has had a limited presence. In addition, IMT had a very strong product portfolio targeted to U.S. federal law enforcement and high-end sports broadcasting customers who now have access to additional solutions based on Vislink’s product configurations. Finally, Vislink has traditionally focused on licensed spectrum solutions where IMT has pioneered the use of non-licensed spectrum for many applications. Combining Vislink Technologies shared spectrum and interference mitigation intellectual property with an expanded IMT/Vislink product lineup may provide an opening into additional customer bases that currently do not have access to licensed spectrum.

Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales team currently is comprised of sales managers responsible for defined regional areas, inside sales personnel, and business development representatives focused on targeted sectors and/or regions. They are supported by solution engineers trained in technical sales with a given market focus. This sales team is focused on supporting our current customers, as well as nurturing relationships with prospective customers in key domestic and international markets. For our IMT and Vislink brands, we employ a combination of sales channels, including direct-to-end customer sales, network group sales, reseller/integrators and Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) sales channels in order to use the most efficient means of reaching customers depending on the market segment. Sales efforts are supported by marketing and public relations activities, digital and print marketing initiatives, the creation of support materials, and trade show and other event appearances.
 
As of December 31, 2018, our business development, sales and marketing team consisted of 44 full-time employees or contractors.
 
Customers
 
Our IMT and Vislink entities have developed significant followings based on the reputation of their product offerings for performance, reliability and use of advanced technology. Both have developed diverse and stable customer bases for repeat product purchases from blue chip, tier-1 clients in the broadcasting and sports and entertainment markets, as well as among high-profile agencies and organizations in the surveillance (military and government) markets.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
We have historically retained contract manufacturers to manufacture, test, assure the quality of, and ship our products. With the acquisitions of IMT and Vislink, we have additional options for both internal and external manufacturing of products. This provides us the opportunity to develop optimal supply chains that are tailored to our needs on a per-product and per-solution basis. Going forward, we anticipate that we will focus on our core strengths, which are innovation and technology design and the development and creation and exploitation of our intellectual property.
 
While we have integrated IMT and Vislink into our plan to build our products, we may continue to rely, particularly in the short term, on third party components and technology to build our products, as we procure components, subassemblies and products necessary for the manufacture of our products based upon our design, development and production needs. While components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources, we currently depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for several components for our products. We rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with our suppliers. We do not currently stockpile enough components to mitigate any potential supply disruption if we are required to re-engineer our products to use alternative components.
