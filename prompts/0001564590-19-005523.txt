Our Talent
 As a global advisory-focused investment bank focused solely on providing innovative services to our clients, our people are our most valuable asset. Our partners average over 25 years of relevant experience, which they leverage to provide the highest quality advice across our broad suite of strategic advisory, shareholder engagement, restructuring and special situations and private fund advisory and placement services. Our partners are supported by a first-rate team of professionals and we are committed to developing and maximizing their talent and skills. We strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, integrity and collaboration among our employees.
 We opportunistically and strategically hire professionals with experience and backgrounds relevant to our various businesses. We work with prestigious undergraduate and graduate programs that have resulted in a steady and high-quality pipeline of junior financial professionals. We place a high degree of emphasis on cultural fit and individual character. Across our firm we devote significant time and resources to training and mentoring our employees to ensure every individual achieves their highest possible potential. This philosophy of investing in our people has been and will continue to be core to our culture and organization.
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 590 individuals globally, including 71 partners.
 Competition
 The financial services industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. Our competitors are other investment banking and financial advisory firms. These entities include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms and commercial banks. We compete on both a global and a regional basis, and on the basis of a number of factors, including depth of client relationships, industry knowledge, transaction execution skills, our range of products and services, innovation, reputation and price.
 We also compete to attract and retain qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our business will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees.
 Regulation
 Our business, as well as the financial services industry generally, is subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and across the globe. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies in the U.S. and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets. In the U.S., the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. PJT Partners LP, through which strategic advisory, shareholder

engagement and restructuring and special situations services are conducted in the United States, and Park Hill Group LLC, which is an entity within the Park Hill private fund advisory and placement services business, are registered broker-dealers. These registered broker-dealers are subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC. In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), a self-regulatory organization that is subject to oversight by the SEC, adopts and enforces rules governing the conduct, and examines the activities of, its member firms, which would include any such registered broker-dealer. State securities regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over any such registered broker-dealer.
 Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including capital structure, recordkeeping and the conduct and qualifications of directors, officers and employees. In particular, as a registered broker-dealer and member of a self-regulatory organization, we are subject to the SEC’s uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. Rule 15c3-1 specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a significant part of a broker-dealer’s assets be kept in relatively liquid form. The SEC and various self-regulatory organizations impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, limit the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SEC’s uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital.
 PJT Partners LP is registered as a “municipal advisor” with the SEC and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the “MSRB”). In 2013 as required under the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC issued its final rule regarding the new category of regulated financial activity: “municipal advisors” (the “MA Rule”). The MA Rule, which became effective in 2014, imposes a fiduciary duty on municipal advisors when advising municipal entities. In addition to the SEC rule, the MSRB has developed a number of implementing rules and interpretive guidance relating to municipal advisors, and we have implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply with such rules and guidance. In recent years, broker-dealer and municipal advisor interaction with municipal entities has become an area of greater rulemaking and regulatory interest; however, we do not expect a materially adverse impact on municipal advisory services.
 Further, Park Hill Group LLC is a registered commodity trading advisor with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and is a member of the National Futures Association (“NFA”), a futures industry self-regulatory organization. The CFTC and NFA regulate futures contracts, swaps and various other financial instruments in which certain of Park Hill Group LLC’s clients may invest.
 In addition to the regulation we are subject to in the U.S., we are subject to regulation internationally. PJT Partners (UK) Limited is licensed with the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and is required to maintain regulatory net capital of €50 thousand. PJT Partners (HK) Limited is licensed with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission and is subject to a minimum liquid capital requirement of HK$3 million.
 Certain parts of our business are subject to compliance with laws and regulations of U.S. federal and state governments, non-U.S. governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to, among other things, the privacy of client information. Any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage.
 The U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., are empowered to conduct periodic examinations and initiate administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer or its directors, officers or employees.
 Broker-dealers are also subject to regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which impose obligations regarding the prevention and detection of money-laundering activities, including the establishment of customer due diligence and other compliance policies and procedures.
 Failure to comply with these requirements may result in monetary, regulatory and, in certain cases, criminal penalties. In connection with its administration and enforcement of economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), publishes a list of individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, targeted countries. It also lists individuals, groups and entities, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers, designated under programs that are not country-specific. Collectively, such individuals and companies are called “Specially Designated Nationals,” or SDNs. Assets of SDNs are blocked, and we are generally prohibited from dealing with them. In addition, OFAC administers a number of comprehensive sanctions and embargoes that target certain countries, governments and geographic regions. We are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions involving any country, region or government that is subject to such comprehensive sanctions.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and the UK 2010 Bribery Act (the “UK Bribery Act”) prohibit the payment of bribes to foreign government officials and political figures. The FCPA prohibits us from making or offering to make any payment, or giving anything of value to a foreign official for the purpose of influencing that official to assist us in obtaining or retaining an improper business advantage. The FCPA has a broad reach, covering all U.S. companies and citizens doing business abroad, among others, and defining a foreign official to include not only those holding public office but also local citizens acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of foreign government-run or -owned organizations or public international organizations. The FCPA also requires maintenance of appropriate books and records and maintenance of adequate internal controls to prevent and detect possible FCPA violations. Similarly, the UK Bribery Act prohibits us from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage.
 Park Hill Group LLC is also affected by various state and local regulations or policies that restrict or prohibit the use of placement agents in connection with investments by public pension funds, including but not limited to, regulations in New York State, New York City, Illinois and California. Similar measures are being considered or have been implemented in other jurisdictions.
 Organizational Structure
 PJT Partners Inc. is a holding company and its only material asset is its controlling equity interest in PJT Partners Holdings LP, and certain cash and cash equivalents it may hold from time to time as described herein in “Part II. Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Dividend Policy.” As the sole general partner of PJT Partners Holdings LP, PJT Partners Inc. operates and controls all of the business and affairs and consolidates the financial results of PJT Partners Holdings LP and its operating subsidiaries. The ownership interests of the holders (other than PJT Partners Inc.) of common units of partnership interest in PJT Partners Holdings LP (“Partnership Units”) are reflected as non-controlling interests in PJT Partners Inc.’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018.
 Our employees and certain current and former Blackstone executive officers and employees also hold all issued and outstanding shares of the Class B common stock of PJT Partners Inc. The shares of Class B common stock have no economic rights but entitle the holder, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held, to a number of votes that is equal to the aggregate number of vested and unvested Partnership Units and LTIP Units (which is a class of partnership interests) in PJT Partners Holdings LP held by such holder on all matters presented to stockholders of PJT Partners Inc. other than director elections and removals. In connection with the spin-off, Blackstone’s senior management, including Mr. Schwarzman and all of Blackstone’s other executive officers, provided an irrevocable proxy to Mr. Taubman to vote their shares of Class B common stock for so long as Mr. Taubman is the Chief Executive Officer of PJT Partners Inc. With respect to the election and removal of directors of PJT Partners Inc., shares of Class B common stock initially entitle holders to only one vote per share, representing significantly less than one percent of the voting power entitled to vote thereon. However, the voting power of Class B common stock with respect to the election and removal of directors of PJT Partners Inc. may be increased to up to the number of votes to which a holder is then entitled on all other matters presented to stockholders. The voting power on applicable matters afforded to holders of partnership interests by their shares of Class B common stock is automatically and correspondingly reduced as they exchange Partnership Units for cash or for shares of Class A common stock of PJT Partners Inc. pursuant to the exchange agreement. If at any time the ratio at which Partnership Units are exchangeable for shares of Class A common stock of PJT Partners Inc. changes from one-for-one, the number of votes to which Class B common stockholders are entitled on applicable matters will be adjusted accordingly. Holders of shares of our Class B common stock will vote together with holders of our Class A common stock as a single class on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally, except as otherwise required by law.
 7

We and the holders of Partnership Units (other than PJT Partners Inc.) also have entered into an exchange agreement under which they (or certain permitted transferees) have the right, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the partnership agreement of PJT Partners Holdings LP, on a quarterly basis, to exchange all or part of their Partnership Units for cash or, at our election, for shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. Further, pursuant to the terms in the partnership agreement of PJT Partners Holdings LP, we may also require holders of Partnership Units who are not Service Providers (as defined in the partnership agreement of PJT Partners Holdings LP) to exchange such Partnership Units. The price per Partnership Unit to be received in a cash-settled exchange will be equal to the fair value of a share of our Class A common stock (determined in accordance with and subject to adjustment under the exchange agreement). In the event that PJT Partners Inc. elects to fund cash-settled exchanges of Partnership Units with new issuances of Class A common stock, the fair value of a share of our Class A common stock will be deemed to be equal to the net proceeds per share of Class A common stock received by PJT Partners Inc. in the related issuance. Accordingly, in this event, the price per Partnership Unit to which an exchanging Partnership Unitholder will be entitled may be greater than or less than the then-current market value of our Class A common stock.
 Refer to Note 13. “Transactions with Related Parties” and Note 14. “Commitments and Contingencies—Transactions and Agreements with Blackstone” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information about agreements entered into in connection with the spin-off.
