Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Organization
Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company registered at and with principal offices at 50 Tice Boulevard, Suite 315, Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey 07677. On November 16, 2016, we purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of Arsia Therapeutics, Inc. (“Arsia”), and subsequently changed its name to Eagle Biologics, Inc. ("Eagle Biologics"). 
Business
Our business model is to develop proprietary innovations to FDA-approved, injectable drugs, that offer commercial and/or functional advantages to currently available alternatives. We have historically been, and will continue to primarily be, focused on developing and commercializing injectable drugs, primarily in the critical care and oncology areas, using the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)'s 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (“NDA”) regulatory pathway. With our addition of Eagle Biologics, we hope to apply our market strategy to offer “biobetter” formulations, and to develop novel biologic products under the pathway provided by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act ("BPCIA"). In addition, we plan to continue to market and/or commercialize our products through marketing partners and/or through our internal direct sales force.
For each of our current and future pre-commercial products, we target market entry no later than the entry of the first generic or biosimilar drug with the goal of substantially converting the market by addressing the needs of stakeholders who ultimately use our products. We believe we can further extend commercial duration through new intellectual property protection and/or orphan drug exclusivity and three years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity for future product candidates, as provided under applicable law and regulations. We strive to enhance branded reference drugs to optimize their ease and safety of use for healthcare providers, produce less drug waste, lower cost to stakeholders, and create the opportunity for label expansion to additional indications. 
Our 505(b)(2) model has been validated by the approval and successful launches of our novel formulations of Argatroban and Ryanodex® (dantrolene sodium) (“Ryanodex”) and Eagle's bendamustine ready-to-dilute ("RTD") 500ml solution (“Big Bag” or "Belrapzo"); marketed by Eagle, and rapidly infused bendamustine RTD (“Bendeka”); marketed by Teva, licensed to and launched jointly with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (“Teva”) in January 2016. We are in the early stages of development with our biologics strategy and do not currently have any commercially approved biologics products.
Our product portfolio now includes four approved products: Argatroban; Ryanodex; Belrapzo; and Bendeka. We have three commercial partners: Teva, which through its subsidiary Cephalon, Inc. ("Cephalon") markets Bendeka, and Chiesi USA, Inc. ("Chiesi") and Sandoz Inc. (“Sandoz”), who pursuant to separate agreements market Argatroban. 
We currently have multiple product candidates in advanced stages of development, and/or under review for approval by the FDA. Additionally, we have other exploratory candidates under a collaborative agreement entered into in January 2016 with Albany Molecular Research, Inc. (“AMRI”). Our advanced product candidates are EP-4104 (dantrolene sodium for exertional heat stroke (“EHS”)) (“EP-4104”), EP-5101 (PEMFEXY™), a pemetrexed injection ready-to-dilute formulation (“EP-5101”) and EGL-5385-C-1701 (fulvestrant). EP-5101 has been tentatively approved by the FDA. EGL-5385-C-1701 and EP-4104, both unapproved, may address unmet medical needs in major specialty markets.
In 2018, we accomplished the following with respect to our product portfolio:

• | On April 16, 2018, we announced the FDA's acceptance of our Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") filing for vasopressin injection, 1ml. This product is the generic version of Endo International plc's original Vasostrict® formulation, which is indicated to increase blood pressure in adults with vasodilatory shock (e.g., post-cardiotomy or sepsis) who remain hypotensive despite fluids and catecholamines.

5


• | On May 15, 2018, the FDA granted final approval for our ready-to-dilute bendamustine hydrochloride solution in a 500ml admixture ("Big Bag") for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”) and patients with indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”) that has progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen. We immediately launched this product upon FDA approval.


• | On August 30, 2018, we announced the completion of enrollment of our second clinical study to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ryanodex (dantrolene sodium for injectable suspension) for the treatment of exertional heat stroke, an investigational new indication for the product.


• | On October 3, 2018, we announced we had entered into an agreement with the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense, the nation’s leading science and technology laboratory in the area of medical chemical countermeasures research and development, to conduct a study to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of Ryanodex.


• | On November 27, 2018, we announced positive results of a pre-clinical study conducted to evaluate the effects of Ryanodex in Acute Radiation Syndrome.

In addition to building our product portfolio, we continue to develop our commercial organization. We have built an internal commercial team consisting of approximately 50 direct sales representatives, support staff and management who are a part of our independent commercial organization.

Our Competitive Strengths
Our Purpose
We believe that many currently available critical care and oncology injectable drugs and biopharmaceuticals have suboptimal characteristics that do not meet the needs of patients, physicians, nurses or pharmacists. These characteristics can impact safety, shelf life, convenience, waste, cost, and ease of use by practitioners and pharmacy staff. For instance, existing drugs may be 
7

packaged inefficiently or come in formulations that require reconstitution or dilution, or which are otherwise difficult or inconvenient to prepare, and which could expose workers to cytotoxic compounds and can result in dosing errors. This can also lead to wasted quantities of drug, inefficiencies in staff time and constrained work flow, reduced shelf life and the need for multiple dosing of individual patients to complete treatment. Likewise the viscosity of many biologic products requires them to be delivered intravenously often in time consuming and sometimes painful treatments for patients. We believe there is a large and unmet market for developing injectable drugs that address the specific needs of patients, physicians, nurses and pharmacists to simplify their use, reduce waste and lower healthcare costs. 
We believe that our management's unique knowledge of the industry as well as the biopharmaceutics formulation acumen presented by Eagle Biologics combine to enable us to compete effectively in the market for injectable therapeutics in both small and large molecule markets. We look to continue to exploit these strengths in order to build upon our portfolio of attractive assets. 
We have and continue to engage physicians, nurses, pharmacists and key opinion leaders, to identify specific products where the characteristics described above present opportunities for product improvement. We evaluate the product opportunities presented by the stakeholders and determine whether or not they conform to our research and development planning. A key aspect of our evaluation is the intellectual property landscape for each product opportunity, including our ability to avoid infringing existing patents and the potential patentability of our modified version of the drug. We utilize our experienced team of formulators with extensive experience with injectable pharmaceuticals, and a track record of success in product development, regulatory relations, and quality assurance to develop improved products.
Because our products are differentiated from the branded reference drugs, we believe we are able to avoid infringing existing patents covering the branded reference drug allowing us to enter the existing market no later than applicable generic drugs, which may be subject to protracted patent litigation that delays market entry. Protracted litigation is a significant barrier to entry for competitors seeking approval of an ANDA referencing the branded reference product, and our early entry into the market leads to less price erosion due to constrained competition. Our patent estate includes over 30 owned or exclusively-licensed U.S. issued patents and over 10 filed U.S. patent applications, as well as several patents and patent applications that have been filed in various worldwide territories, that we believe protect or will protect, as applicable the market value of our current portfolio of products. We believe that other potential barriers to entry for our competitors consist of the following:

• | our early entry into the market allows us to influence usage patterns when fewer, if any, competitors exist and allows us to market our products as improved versions of the branded reference drug prior to or concurrent with any generic entry, thereby giving us the opportunity to capture significant market share at this early stage. We believe that such early entry into the market will limit later conversions into generic versions of the branded reference drugs, deterring competition and allowing us to maintain market share and favorable pricing;


• | the potential for seven years of exclusivity upon approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA that receives orphan drug status; and


• | the potential for three years of regulatory exclusivity for our future product candidates upon approval, if any, of a 505(b)(2) NDA supported by new clinical investigations (other than bioequivalence and bioavailability studies) essential to approval of the application.

Our product portfolio is focused on oncology, critical care, and orphan diseases and includes four approved products, a tentative approval, and several distinct product candidates in advanced development. Additionally, we have other exploratory candidates under our collaborative agreement with AMRI, and are developing a “biobetters” pipeline at our subsidiary, Eagle Biologics. We believe that we can leverage our formulation and development expertise to achieve improved product attributes in terms of potential for longer stability, shorter infusion times, less waste and/or ease and safety of use for healthcare professionals and achieve longer commercial duration compared to generic competitors. We believe that our products may offer certain benefits as compared to existing injectable drugs which may include one or more of the following:

• | improved safety through elimination of reconstitution in the pharmacy or in the acute care setting;


• | reduction in the number of injections required;


• | reduction in the volume of drug needed to be injected, potentially expanding the application to additional medical situations;


• | reduction in the amount of diluent required to administer the drug;


• | reduction in drug waste;


• | reduction in drug infusion time; and


• | potential label expansion to include additional indications.

Our Strategy
Our goal is to be a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of injectable 
8

pharmaceutical products for use in acute care settings that represent an improvement over the currently marketed reference drug. Our strategy to achieve this goal includes:
Enter the market no later than the first generic drug.    We intend to enter the market no later than the first generic or biosimilar of the branded reference drug. During this period, the number of competitors is lowest and branded drugs are generally at peak or near peak value. This will allow us to influence usage patterns and market our products as improved versions, thereby achieving favorable pricing. Even if we enter the market simultaneously with, or after, the first generic drug, as a 505(b)(2) applicant, we would be able to enter the market without regard to any generic drug's 180-day exclusivity period.
Retain commercial rights in the United States and selectively partner outside of the United States.    In general, we believe that we can cost-effectively commercialize our products in the United States internally or through a contracted sales force and selected commercial arrangements, and thereby retain the commercial value of these products. We have established a small, contract specialty sales force focusing on GPOs, hospital systems and key stakeholders in acute care settings, primarily hospitals. Outside of the United States, we may utilize partners for the commercialization of our products.
Strengthen our product portfolio.    We intend to continue to strengthen our product portfolio in the areas of oncology, critical care and orphan diseases. We will continue to develop our current product portfolio and leverage our expertise to identify new products with suboptimal characteristics that present us with significant opportunity for revenue generation. In addition to our internal efforts, we will opportunistically in-license or acquire product candidates that fit our therapeutic areas of focus and meet our rigorous evaluation process.
Continue to build a robust intellectual property portfolio.    Our patent estate includes over 30 owned or exclusively-licensed U.S. issued patents and over 10 filed U.S. patent applications, as well as several that have been filed in various worldwide territories, that protect or will protect, as applicable the market value of our approved and pipeline products. We intend to continue to build our patent portfolio by filing for patent protection on new developments with respect to our product candidates that will not infringe patents that cover the branded reference drugs. We expect that these will, if issued, allow us to list our own patents in the Orange Book, to which potential competitors will be required to certify upon submission of their applications referencing our products, if approved.
Our Products and Product Portfolio
Belrapzo and Bendeka (Licensed to Teva and SymBio) for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
Overview
Bendamustine is an alkylating agent approved for use in CLL, and indolent B-cell NHL, that has progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen (which we refer to herein as the NHL indication). 
U.S. Marketed Bendamustine Products
Teva currently markets its lyophilized bendamustine product under the trade name Treanda®. Teva ceased distribution of Treanda® liquid on March 30, 2016.
Limitations of Marketed Bendamustine Products
Treanda® is a lyophilized powder that requires reconstitution in water prior to use. A 500 mL intravenous (IV) administration is used over 30 or 60 minutes for CLL and NHL patients, respectively. The product is sold in single use vials creating an opportunity for product waste in certain applications.
Eagle's Solution: Belrapzo and Bendeka
The Belrapzo and Bendeka liquid formulations eliminate the need to reconstitute the drug prior to use, relative to the lyophilized presentation of Treanda®. As a result, we believe that relative to the lyophilized presentation of Treanda® there is less potential for dosing errors, less exposure to cytotoxic powders and a more efficient work flow. 
Additionally, admixtures prepared with Bendeka contain lower sodium as compared with Treanda® which could be of benefit to the predominantly elderly, renally impaired and cardiovascular compromised patients. Also, Bendeka is available in a multi-use 
9

vial, which allows infusion centers and hospitals to avoid needless waste of unused drug remaining after procedures with single use vials.
Big Bag 
On May 15, 2018, the FDA granted final approval for Big Bag, a ready-to-dilute (“RTD”), multi-dose liquid with extended drug stability for use with a 500mL intravenous, or IV, infusion bag. 
Teva License- Bendeka
Bendeka is the same RTD, multi-dose liquid formulation as Belrapzo, with extended drug stability, but for use with a 50 mL IV infusion bag, which enables it to be administered in a shorter time-period than current drugs on the market and represents a label expansion from Belrapzo. We received orphan drug designation for Bendeka for CLL and NHL in July 2014. We entered into the Cephalon License to market this product. See License Agreements - Bendamustine License Agreement, below.
Argatroban for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia
Argatroban is an anti-coagulant originally developed for the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ("HIT"). Our formulation of Argatroban, was our first product approved by the FDA and is marketed by Chiesi and Sandoz under separate agreements with us. See License Agreements - License and Distribution Agreement - Chiesi; and Settlement Agreement and Related Supply and Distribution Agreement with Sandoz, below. 
Currently-Marketed Argatroban Products
Argatroban is currently sold by GlaxoSmithKline (“GSK”), West-ward, Chiesi and Sandoz. It is sold in 250mL (GSK and West-ward), 125mL (Sandoz) and 50mL (Chiesi and Sandoz) presentations. According to IQVIA Holdings Inc., Argatroban had U.S. annual sales of $39 million in 2018. 
Limitations of Argatroban Marketed Products
The branded form of argatroban from GSK and West-ward is supplied in a 2.5 mL vial with 100 mg/mL of active pharmaceutical ingredient. In this formulation, the current product requires 100-fold dilution for infusion, requiring the use of a 250 mL intravenous bag, typically resulting in approximately 30% waste primarily driven by prophylactic administration while waiting for HIT testing results, common infection control policies requiring change of intravenous bags every 24 hours and patient release from hospital prior to complete administration.
Eagle's Solution: Argatroban Injection
Our formulation of Argatroban is supplied in a single-use vial, containing 50mg of drug in a 50mL aqueous solution, where only 1% of the drug is wasted. Argatroban is ready to use and the vial label contains a ring sling for convenient IV pole administration. It was approved by the FDA on June 29, 2011, for treatment of HIT in patients. 
Ryanodex® for Malignant Hyperthermia
Overview 
Dantrolene was first introduced to the U.S. market in 1979 and is currently the only drug approved to treat a rare genetic disorder called malignant hyperthermia ("MH"). There are only 500 to 800 cases of MH in the United States each year, qualifying dantrolene for orphan drug designation. This disease is triggered when a patient with this genetic predisposition has a surgical procedure and is exposed to certain inhaled anesthetics or the muscle relaxant, succinylcholine. When this exposure occurs, a metabolic response can be triggered in the patient resulting in an episode of MH that can be fatal if not treated immediately. Because dantrolene is the only approved drug available to treat MH, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, (the "Joint Commission") requires that all hospitals stock vials of this product at all times, generally in the operating room area. 
Currently-Preexisitng Dantrolene Products for MH
The two preexisting injectable dantrolene drugs on the market for the treatment of MH, Dantrium® and Revonto®, are offered in a vial containing 20mg of lyophilized powder that requires mixing with 60mL of sterile water. We estimate that the addressable 
10

U.S. market opportunity for MH drugs is approximately $75 million per year.
Limitations of Dantrium® and Revonto®
When an MH crisis occurs during surgery, the surgical procedure is immediately discontinued and the anesthesiologist and others in the operating room quickly begin reconstituting dantrolene, often at the same time as performing other resuscitative efforts, in order to administer the drug to the patient as an IV push. Based on recommendations from the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States ("MHAUS"), the recognized authority on treating MH in the United States, the recommended dose is 2.5mg/kg or higher. It is critically important that the drug be administered as rapidly as possible, as MH symptoms include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, raised CO2 levels and very high body temperature levels. If not treated immediately, the disease can be fatal.
Because of the dosing required in adult patients to reverse the MH symptoms and the current formulations of Dantrium® and Revonto®, it is often necessary to reconstitute 10 to 20 vials of dantrolene. As the current formulations are also poorly water soluble, this process generally takes up to 15 to 20 minutes at a point when time is critical and the patient is extremely unstable. Furthermore, the volume of diluent required to reconstitute Dantrium® and Revonto® means that the adult patient receives a significant volume of fluid (600mL to 1,200mL) as an IV infusion, which on occasion can result in detrimental secondary physiological consequences for the patient, such as pulmonary edema and extravasation, which can lead to tissue necrosis.
Eagle's Solution: Ryanodex®
We have developed a differentiated formulation of dantrolene sodium that was approved by the FDA in July 2014 and is currently sold under the brand name, Ryanodex®, for the treatment of MH. The presentation is a 5ml vial containing 250mg of dantrolene sodium in lyophilized powder form.
We believe that the immediate benefits of our Ryanodex® formulation are clinically significant in critical care situations. Specifically, Ryanodex® reduces the amount of time to reconstitute and administer dantrolene from 15 to 20 minutes with Dantrium® and Revonto®, to 1 minute, as the anesthesiologist will be able to mix and administer a dose of 250mg from a single vial of Ryanodex® in contrast to mixing and administering up to 12 or more vials of Dantrium® or Revonto®. A recent retrospective study conducted by MHAUS demonstrated that every 15-minute delay in treating MH resulted in a 7.8% increase in patient complications. 
EP-4104 (dantrolene) for Exertional Heat Stroke ("EHS")
EHS is a rare, sudden and unpredictable life-threatening medical condition. It is thought that symptoms and effects are correlated to MH and our research and development efforts suggest dantrolene may be beneficial for treating EHS.
EHS is one of the leading causes of death in athletes, including college and high-school students. EHS is also a leading cause of non-combat death in the military. EHS is a state of extreme hyperthermia (above 104°F) that occurs when heat that is generated by muscular exercise exceeds the body's ability to dissipate it. EHS typically affects seemingly healthy individuals during exercise and manifests within a few minutes to hours of such activity and is characterized by an increased core body temperature and central nervous system dysfunction including delirium, convulsions, and coma. Predisposing factors to EHS include a lack of heat acclimatization, poor physical fitness, dehydration, recent infection, exercising in warm and humid conditions and concurrent illness. 
Limitations of Current EHS Therapies
There are currently no FDA-approved products that treat EHS, and patients continue to die or suffer significant morbidity from the condition. The current treatment regimen for EHS is not directed at the underlying cause of the disease, but is essentially symptomatic therapy. Currently, to treat EHS, the standard treatment includes body surface cooling by water immersion or ice packs and support of organ system function with a goal of accelerating the transfer of heat from the skin to the environment. Even if these cooling techniques are properly implemented patients are still subject to risk of brain damage, irreversible organ damage and death.
Eagle's Solution: EP-4104 
EP-4104's presentation will initially be a 5mL vial containing 250mg of dantrolene in lyophilized powder form requiring reconstitution. We believe that EP-4104 may provide significant benefits over the current standard of care, which may not be 
11

readily available in most settings. Independent market research commissioned by us suggests that the worldwide peak annual revenue for EHS could exceed $400 million.
EP-4104 Clinical Development and Regulatory Status
In February 2016, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to our product candidate EP-4104 (i.e. Ryanodex® for the treatment of EHS). The FDA's Fast Track program facilitates the development and review of drugs intended to treat serious conditions and address an unmet medical need. A drug development program with Fast Track designation is afforded greater access to the FDA for the purpose of expediting the drug's development, review and potential approval to get important new drugs to the patient earlier.
On July 11, 2016, the FDA determined that no additional human safety and efficacy data would be required for the submission of EP-4101. Following the completion of additional animal studies the NDA was submitted on January 20, 2017.
On July 26, 2017, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding our 505(b)(2) NDA for Ryanodex for the treatment of exertional heat stroke (“EHS”), in conjunction with external cooling methods. Based on our meeting with the FDA, the Company conducted an additional clinical trial in August 2018 during the Hajj pilgrimage, similar to the study conducted during the Hajj in 2015. On August 30, 2018, we announced the completion of enrollment of our second clinical study to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ryanodex. During the 2018 Hajj, overall emergency room visits were dramatically decreased from previous years due to well-implemented crowd management, lower temperatures, lower humidity and other external factors. As a result, the number of EHS patients available for study enrollment was also significantly less than in previous years, and therefore much lower than anticipated. The preliminary assessment of patients enrolled is consistent with the data from the study conducted in 2015, in which patients dosed with Ryanodex plus Standard of Care (“SOC”) showed an additive benefit compared to patients receiving SOC only. We intend to complete the analysis of the data and meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to discuss next steps in 2019.
EP-5101 (PEMFEXY™) for Lung Cancer
EP-5101 is an IV-administered cancer agent indicated for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. We are developing EP-5101 as a ready-to-use/dilute liquid form of pemetrexed that will be available in a 25mg/mL per vial. Because our product, if approved, will be available in liquid form, product reconstitution will not be required, making EP-5101 a preferred formulation under the Joint Commission guidelines.
Currently-Marketed Pemetrexed Product
The branded form of a pemetrexed product is marketed by Lilly Pharmaceuticals as Alimta. Alimta is approved for use to treat non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. Alimta's lyophilized formulation utilizes pemetrexed disodium. The product presentations for Alimta are 100mg and 500mg single use vials containing lyophilized power that must be reconstituted before patient administration. Once mixed, Alimta must be used within 24 hours due to product stability concerns. According to Lilly Pharmaceuticals, worldwide sales of Alimta for the 2017 calendar year were approximately $1.0 billion.
Limitations of Alimta
Alimta, a lyophilized pemetrexed disodium formulation requiring reconstitution, adds time to administration, presents cytotoxic safety issues for healthcare professionals administering the drug and the potential for dosing errors. Because reconstitution of Alimta is generally not performed until the patient has cleared all tests necessary to receive the drug, this process contributes to a significant amount of time spent by such patients in infusion clinics. Additionally, this method of administration limits the number of patients that may be treated on any given day by such clinics. Furthermore, as with any oncology drug, cytotoxic vapors released through reconstitution can be potentially harmful to pharmacists, physicians and nurses. Moreover, dosing errors may occur during reconstitution, as incorrect amounts of diluent may be used. As a result, lyophilized formulations are less preferred by the Joint Commission as compared to an RTD product.
Eagle's Solution: EP-5101 (PEMFEXY™)
EP-5101 is an RTD liquid formulation of pemetrexed. As an RTD liquid formulation, EP-5101 will not require additional time for reconstitution and may avoid certain safety concerns to healthcare professionals, including reducing exposure to the drug's cytotoxic 
12

vapors during reconstitution by healthcare providers, and potential dosing errors during mixing. This could allow for a more efficient work flow within the infusion clinic and may result in an opportunity to reduce office staff and see more patients each day.
EP-5101 (PEMFEXY™) Development and Regulatory Status
We submitted an NDA for EP-5101 on December 30, 2016 for use in non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. During February 2017, we received confirmation from the FDA that the filing was accepted. On October 27, 2017, we were granted tentative approval for EP-5101 by the FDA.
EGL-5385-C-1701 (fulvestrant) for Breast Cancer
Fulvestrant is an injectable estrogen receptor antagonist. It is used for the treatment of hormone receptor positive advanced breast cancer for post-menopausal women whose disease has progressed following treatment with prior endocrine therapy.
Currently-Marketed Fulvestrant Products
The branded form of fulvestrant is Faslodex, a 500mg injectable product marketed by AstraZeneca plc. Worldwide sales of Faslodex were $941 million in 2017, which included US sales of $492 million.
Limitations of Faslodex
Faslodex is administered in two deep intramuscular injections of high viscosity product per dose of treatment (5 ml each) over 1-2 minutes into each buttock. The procedure is painful and Faslodex injection reactions have been associated with peripheral nerve adverse reactions, including risk of damaging the sciatic nerve.
Eagle’s Solution: EGL-5385-C-1701
On October 30, 2018, we announced that the Company’s fulvestrant formulation has not met the primary pharmacokinetic endpoint evaluating the bioequivalence of the Company’s formulation compared to Faslodex in its open label, randomized, pharmacokinetic and safety study conducted in 600 healthy female volunteers across multiple U.S. sites. Eagle continues to pursue development of an innovative formulation that would require a single injection using a smaller needle thus requiring less time to dose the product while potentially reducing the pain and adverse reactions to injection. The 500 mg dose would be delivered in a single low viscosity 5 mL injection. 
Additional Products in our Portfolio
Vasopressin
Vasopressin injection is indicated to increase blood pressure in adults with vasodilatory shock who remain hypotensive despite fluids and catecholamines. We filed and ANDA in April 2018 for a generic version of VASOSTRICT® (vasopressin IV solution (infusion)), which variously covers either vasopressin-containing pharmaceutical compositions or methods of using a vasopressin-containing dosage form to increase blood pressure in humans. In May 2018, the NDA owner filed a lawsuit against us within the 45-day deadline to invoke a 30-month stay of FDA approval pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman legislative scheme. In August 2018, Eagle filed an answer and a counterclaim for non-infringement and invalidity of asserted patents. A claim construction hearing is scheduled for May 2019, with a bench trial scheduled for May 2020. 
Other Opportunities
We are pursuing several additional potential products and product indications that address broad indications such as oncology, emergency medicine, infectious diseases and others. We intend to use our novel and well-developed methods to identify ideal development candidates and to commercialize improved formulations of widely prescribed therapeutics.
In addition to our internal efforts, in January 2016 we entered into an agreement with AMRI to jointly develop and manufacture several select and complex parenteral drug products for registration and subsequent commercialization in the United States.
Under the terms of the agreement, AMRI will develop and initially provide cGMP manufacturing and analytical support for the registration of the new product candidates. We will be responsible for advancing the product candidates through clinical trials and regulatory submissions.

Eagle Biologics
On November 16, 2016, we acquired Arsia Therapeutics, Inc. and subsequently changed its name to Eagle Biologics, Inc. Eagle Biologics was founded in 2013 as an early stage corporation focused on using proprietary technology to significantly improve both approved and novel biologic pharmaceutical products. The technology we acquired in the acquisition enables low-viscosity, high-concentration monoclonal antibody (mAb) formulations to be delivered subcutaneously.  Our aim is threefold: (i) to improve the formulation of biologic products thereby providing a market advantage with a differentiated product; (ii) to create IP around the formulation optimization extending market exclusivity, and (iii) to do so in an efficient manner, using as much reference-product data as possible to minimize clinical trial time and expense. The opportunity is driven by a library of patent protected excipients for use in pharmaceutical products.
Our plan for our biologics business is to partner with large pharmaceutical and biotech companies to improve the delivery of marketed biologics by eliminating IV infusions in favor of subcutaneous ("SC") routes of administration or, in cases where a SC product exists, to reduce the volume or number of injections.  Currently, Eagle Biologics has feasibility study agreements in place with multiple partners to apply its technology to designated proteins. Once proof of concept has been established, and an opportunity is identified with a particular protein, Eagle Biologics plans to enter into a License and Development Agreement with the sponsor company to develop and seek FDA approval for the “biobetter.” As of this filing, Eagle Biologics has no product in late stage development.
The formulation and development of biologic and/or biosimilar drugs is a highly competitive business and competition includes some of the industry’s largest and well-funded pharmaceutical companies. Eagle Biologics will seek opportunities in this growing field to develop and market its “bio-better” products through collaborations with these companies. 
Sales and Marketing
Historically, we have chosen to out-license the commercial rights for products we have developed, such as Argatroban and is sold by both Chiesi under an exclusive license from us, and by Sandoz as part of a settlement of a paragraph IV dispute between the parties and rights to our bendamustine rapid infusion product for treatment of patients with CLL and patients with NHL pursuant to the terms of the Cephalon License. 
Other than with respect to products subject to existing commercialization arrangements, we intend to commercialize our product portfolio in the United States with our commercial organization. To expand our footprint in the Ryanodex® for MH market we have built an internal commercial team consisting of approximately 50 direct sales representatives, support staff and management who are a part of our independent commercial organization. 
Manufacturing
We do not own any manufacturing facilities. The manufacture of sterile injectables is highly reliant on very complex sterile techniques and personnel aseptic techniques which present significant challenges and requires specialized expertise. Further, sterile processes have a high level of scrutiny by regulatory agencies. Consequently, we utilize a network of third party manufacturers for production of our products. All manufacturers are monitored and evaluated by our quality department to assess compliance with regulatory requirements and our internal quality standards and benchmarks.
Historically, sterile injectable manufacturers have, from time to time, had quality control difficulties. If non-conformances occur, remediation, such as temporary voluntary closure or renovations of major production facilities, could be costly and time consuming, resulting in cascading and persistent shortages. Moreover, high rates of capacity utilization may also limit the ability of manufacturers to perform routine maintenance and keep facilities in state of compliance which can lead to product recalls or other supply disruptions.
We have a highly experienced quality group that works with and regularly inspects or meets with our manufacturers to review the manufacturing process for our products and to provide input on quality issues. We have recognized the risk of such supply chain disruptions and approached the situation through risk management strategies designed to mitigate the effects of such disruptions. These include having our products and product candidates manufactured at more than one site around the world. While this creates additional effort and requires maintaining dialog and traveling to and overseeing production at a number of facilities, we believe our manufacturing risks are better managed by utilizing a range of third party manufacturers at diverse locations. We seek to minimize the risk of catastrophic events that could occur if our products were manufactured in a single location. Currently, with the exception of one site, no contract manufacturer produces more than one product for us. We currently utilize two manufacturing sites in India and four manufacturing site in the United States. We plan to manufacture the additional products in our portfolio at additional sites in the United States.

Intellectual Property and Exclusivity
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business. We seek to obtain and maintain patents for any patentable aspects of our products or product candidates, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to our business model and maintaining a competitive advantage over generic competitors. Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the fields targeted by our products and product candidates.
Patents and Patent Applications 
We are the exclusive licensee under our license with Lyotropic to a family of patents and applications that relate to low volume formulations of dantrolene, and methods of treatment using dantrolene. There are eight issued U.S. patents, and several pending U.S. patent applications, along with foreign counterparts that include both issued patents and pending applications. The issued U.S. patents cover low volume formulations of dantrolene in reconstitutable and in ready to use liquid form. We expect that the issued patents will expire no later than July 1, 2025.
We are the sole owner of over 10 issued patents, several pending U.S. patent applications, and multiple patents and/or corresponding foreign filings for patent applications in a number of jurisdictions covering various formulations and methods of use of bendamustine. We are currently prosecuting these applications, which, if issued, would expire between 2031 and 2033.
We are the sole owner of a portfolio of issued U.S. patents and pending applications, and corresponding issued foreign patents and patent applications in a range of countries that cover various formulations and methods of use of Argatroban. We expect that our issued patents in the United States will expire no later than September 26, 2027, and our applications, if issued, will expire no later than October 9, 2027.

We are the owner of U.S. Patent 8,431,539 expiring July 20, 2031 and covering daptomycin.
Eagle also has a patent portfolio of issued and/or pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding foreign patent application in a range of countries that cover its biologics platform technologies. We are the sole owner of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,833,513, 9,913,905 and 9,925,263 expiring between 2034 and 2036. 
Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
Trade secrets play an important role in protecting our products and provide protection beyond patents and regulatory exclusivity. The scale-up and commercial manufacture of our products involves processes, custom equipment, and in-process and release analytical techniques that we believe are unique to us. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these security measures, individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our proprietary technology and processes may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors or any future collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring third parties with whom we contract for services related to our products, including manufacturing services to agree to terms in our agreements with such third parties that protect our confidential and trade secret information. We also require our employees, consultants and other advisors to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention obligations. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from entities that receive our confidential data or materials.

Bendamustine License Agreement
On February 13, 2015, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for Bendeka which was approved by the FDA on December 8, 2015. Also, on February 13, 2015, we entered into the Cephalon License with Cephalon, for U.S. and Canadian rights to Bendeka for treatment of patients with CLL and patients with NHL. Subsequently, with the consent of the Company, Cephalon assigned to Teva Pharmaceuticals International GmbH (“TPIG”) all of Cephalon’s rights and obligations under the Cephalon License. Accordingly, all references to “Cephalon” or to the “Cephalon License” and the related supply agreements for Bendeka should be read and construed as references to TPIG and to the license agreement and supply agreements for Bendeka to which the Company and TPIG are now parties. Pursuant to the terms of the Cephalon License, Cephalon is responsible for all U.S. commercial activities for the product including promotion and distribution, and we are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all regulatory approvals and conducting post-approval clinical studies. Additionally, under the terms of the Cephalon License, the Company received an upfront cash payment of $30 million, received a $15 million milestone payment in January 2016 in connection with the FDA approval of Bendeka in December 2015, received a $40 million milestone in the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with the receipt of the J-Code for Bendeka and in Q1 of 2017, Bendeka reached $500 million in cumulative net sales, triggering an additional $25 million sales-based milestone payment. In addition, the royalty payments of 20% of net sales of the product that the Company was entitled to receive increased to 25% on receipt of the J-Code. In connection with the Cephalon License, the Company has entered into a supply agreement with Cephalon, pursuant to which the Company is responsible for supplying product to Cephalon. During the quarter-ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to that certain Exclusive License Agreement 
17

(the "Cephalon License") with Cephalon and the related supply agreements for Bendeka. The amendment expands the geographical scope of the rights granted under the original agreement to include certain territories outside the US and Canada. In accordance with this amendment, the Company recorded $1.75 million in license and other revenue on the statements of operations for the year-ended December 31, 2016. The Company is also eligible to receive up to $750.0 thousand on each regulatory approval received in certain additional territories, not to exceed $2.25 million, as well as royalties on future sales.
Cephalon Settlement and License Agreement
On February 13, 2015, we entered into the Cephalon Settlement Agreement with Cephalon, in connection with the Cephalon License, pursuant to which the parties agreed to settle the pending patent infringement claims against each other regarding Cephalon's US Patent No. 8,791,270, under which we agreed to enter into a Consent Judgment regarding the ‘270 patent. As part of the Cephalon Settlement Agreement, Cephalon has agreed to waive its orphan drug exclusivities for the treatment of patients with CLL and patients with NHL.
SymBio Product Collaboration and License Agreement 
On September 20, 2017, we entered into the SymBio License with SymBio for the rights to develop and commercialize EP-3101 and Bendeka (collectively, the “Products”) in Japan. Under the SymBio License, SymBio will be responsible for all development of the Products in Japan and for obtaining and maintaining all regulatory approvals of the Products in Japan, with a target for regulatory approval of a Product in Japan in 2020. SymBio will bear all costs of development of the Products in Japan except that, if Japanese regulatory authorities require a certain clinical study to be conducted as a condition for approving one of the Products in Japan, we would share 50% of the out-of-pocket costs of that clinical study up to a specified dollar amount as a reduction to future royalty payments. Based on our assessment of the probability of additional costs, we have not deferred revenue on the SymBio License. SymBio will also be responsible, at its sole cost, for all marketing, promotion, distribution and sales of the Products in Japan and is obligated to launch the Products and meet certain minimum detailing, promotion and marketing commitments in connection with commercialization of the Products in Japan.
SymBio currently markets in Japan TREAKISYM®, a lyophilized powder formulation of bendamustine hydrochloride indicated for CLL, relapsed or refractory low-grade NHL, mantle cell lymphoma (“MCL”), and as a first line treatment of low-grade NHL and MCL. Under the SymBio License, SymBio may continue to market TREAKISYM® in Japan and SymBio will be permitted to develop and market certain other bendamustine hydrochloride products in Japan for limited indications.
Pursuant to the terms of the SymBio License, Eagle and SymBio will enter into a separate supply agreement, under which we will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying the Products to SymBio for development and commercialization in Japan. After a period of time following launch of a Product, SymBio will have the right to assume the responsibility for manufacturing of the Products in and for Japan. Under the SymBio License, we will retain the right to control the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of our patents covering the Products, both inside and outside of Japan.
Under the SymBio License, we earned an upfront non-refundable cash payment of $12.5 million in the third quarter of 2017, and we are eligible to receive a milestone payment upon approval of a Product in Japan and a milestone payment upon achievement of certain cumulative net sales of the Products in Japan. After regulatory approval of a Product in Japan, we will also receive tiered, low double-digit royalties on net sales of the Products in Japan for so long as there are patents covering the Products in Japan or regulatory exclusivity for the Products in Japan.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our competitors include organizations such as major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than products that we are currently selling through partners or developing or that we may develop, which could render our products obsolete and noncompetitive. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability 
18

of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. We also expect to face competition in our efforts to identify appropriate collaborators or partners to help commercialize our product portfolio in our target commercial markets.
Government Regulation
FDA Approval Process for Drugs and Biologics
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDCA, and in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending applications, clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug biologic or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:

• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's current good laboratory practice ("cGLP") regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug ("IND") application for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;


• | approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB") at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practices ("cGCP") to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA's cGMP regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;


• | satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process takes many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including cGLPs. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND application is submitted.
The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. A separate submission to an existing IND application must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent IRB, covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of certain clinical trials. For purposes of an NDA or BLA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
19

Phase 1:    In Phase 1, through the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness.
Phase 2:    Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks.
Phase 3:    Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an application is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. Under federal law, the submission of most applications is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved application is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under PDUFA the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Priority Review designation is given to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The FDA endeavors to review applications subject to Standard Review within ten to twelve months, whereas the FDA's goal is to review Priority Review applications within six to eight months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity.
The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
Before approving an NDA or a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing process and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications and the application contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A tentative approval is issued to a 505(b)(2) NDA if the sponsor must await the expiration of an Orange Book listed patent covering the reference product. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the application, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies ("REMS") program to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. If the FDA determines a REMS program is necessary during review of the application, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS program may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug's risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use, such as special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special 
20

monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy. The requirement for a REMS program can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.
Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms.
Further changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement before the change can be implemented, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the similar procedures in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing original applications.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion, including standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced and announced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug's benefits outweigh its risks. In addition, regulatory authorities may take other enforcement action, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act ("PDMA") which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. A growing majority of states also impose certain drug pedigree requirements on the sale and distribution of prescription drugs.
The FDA may require post-approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem it appropriate. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug.
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
ANDA Approval Process
The Hatch-Waxman Act, established abbreviated FDA approval procedures for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to proprietary 
21

drugs previously approved by the FDA through its NDA process. Approval to market and distribute these drugs is obtained by filing an ANDA with the FDA. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. Premarket applications for generic drugs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, a generic applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. In certain situations, an applicant may obtain ANDA approval of a generic product with a strength or dosage form that differs from a referenced innovator drug pursuant to the filing and approval of an ANDA Suitability Petition. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator drug, if it is intended for a different use, or if it is not subject to an approved Suitability Petition. However, such a product might be approved under an NDA, with supportive data from clinical trials.
505(b)(2) NDAs
As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the branded reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant's product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a "section viii" statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.
Non-Patent Exclusivity
In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by FDA in any other NDA. An "active moiety" is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance's physiological or pharmacological action. During the five year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA's findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification.
A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition 
22

of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period.
FDA Approval for Biosimilars
In 2010, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) was enacted creating a statutory pathway for licensure of biological products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, reference biological products licensed under the PHSA. The BPCIA grants innovator manufacturers 12 years of exclusivity from the date of approval of the original, or reference, BLA before approving licenses for biosimilars. Innovators may also be entitled to a potential six-month extension of exclusivity if the results of pediatric studies are provided to the FDA. The BPCIA establishes procedures by which the biosimilar applicant is to provide information about its application and product to the reference product sponsor. The BPCIA also details how information about potentially relevant patents is shared between the sponsors and how litigation may proceed prior to approval of the biosimilar application. The BPCIA, like the Hatch Waxman Act, provides a period of exclusivity for the first biosimilar to obtain license from FDA as interchangeable with the reference product. 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, the FDA will grant orphan designation for that product for the orphan disease indication. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation, however, does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Orphan drug designation provides manufacturers with research grants, tax credits and eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval of the active moiety for that disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same indication, except in limited circumstances. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan indication for which it received the designation, it will not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. As a result, even if one of our product candidates receives orphan exclusivity, we may still be subject to competition. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor's product for the same indication or disease.
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory 
23

approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are subject to numerous regulations by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA including, but not limited to, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and its various enforcement divisions, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the Office of Inspector General ("OIG"), the Office for Human Research Protections ("OHRP"), and the Office of Research Integrity ("ORI"), state Attorneys General, state Medicaid Fraud Control Units, or MFCUs, and other state and local government agencies. Healthcare laws and regulations that may govern our business include the following. 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce in return for either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, recommendation, leasing, ordering or furnishing of a good, facility, item, or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to, among other things, arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on one hand, and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, on the other. The term "remuneration" expressly includes kickbacks, bribes or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability in all cases. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "ACA"), among other things, amended the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The ACA also provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (discussed below). Further, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these state laws may be broader in scope in that some of these state laws extend to all payors and may not contain safe harbors.
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval by the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. The "qui tam" provisions of the federal civil False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring a civil action on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and potentially to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the federal civil False Claims Act. Many of these state laws are broader in scope and apply to all payors, and therefore, are not limited to only those claims submitted to the federal government. There are many potential bases for liability under the federal civil False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, and improper promotion of off-label uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a drug's label. Our future activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. 
Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") created several additional federal civil and 
criminal statutes that prohibit healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended certain of these federal criminal statutes such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed 
24

a violation.
In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain "covered entities," which are certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, which are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"), which expanded certain of HIPAA's privacy and security standards. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's security standards and certain privacy standards directly applicable to business associates. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
Additionally, federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act created under Section 6002 of the ACA and its implementing regulations require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to "payments or other transfers of value" made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors of medicine, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), generally, with some exceptions, and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, physicians and teaching hospitals. Applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations must also report annually to the CMS certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. 
There are also an increasing number of analogous state laws that require manufacturers to file reports with states on pricing and marketing information, such as tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations, other remuneration and items of value provided to health care professionals and health care entities. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Several states have also enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish and implement commercial compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities and/or register their sales representatives. Certain state laws also regulate manufacturers' use of identifiable data. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant administrative, criminal and civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, integrity obligations, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under these laws or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. 
To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we also may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our approved product portfolio, as well as our pre-clinical and clinical product portfolio, if and when approved, will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of our product portfolio will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product portfolio will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit, and/or similar healthcare management organizations, or are reimbursed 
25

by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. The market for our product portfolio will depend significantly on access to third-party payors' formularies, or lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement.
Also, third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Further, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that adequate coverage and reimbursement will be obtained. The cost of pharmaceuticals and medical devices continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor scrutiny. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience continued pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative and administrative proposals. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected by current and future third-party payor policies as well as healthcare legislative and administrative reforms.
Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product portfolio and to operate profitably.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third-party payors' reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that will likely affect our future operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs, improve access, and improve quality. 
By way of example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed, which significantly changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry included, among others, the following:

• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively;


• | new methodologies by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and for drugs that are line extension products;


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;


• | extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, unless the drug is subject to discounts under the 340B drug discount program;


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;


• | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;


• | a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;


• | new requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act for manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and,

26


• | a new requirement to annually report certain drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to licensed practitioners, or to pharmacies of hospitals or other healthcare entities.

Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the U.S. Presidential administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, the U.S. President has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) included a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On January 22, 2018, the U.S. President signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the U.S. Presidential administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace ACA will impact ACA. 
Other healthcare legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, following passage of subsequent legislation, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations. 
In addition, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act signed into law on November 27, 2013 imposes on manufacturers of certain pharmaceutical products new obligations related to product tracking and tracing, among others, which will be phased in over ten years.  Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers subject to this federal law will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product.  The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Covered manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed.  Further, under this new legislation, covered manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen,  and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. For example, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, in January 2016, CMS issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid drug rebate program. The final rule, effective April 1, 2016, among other things, revises the manner in which the “average manufacturer price” is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program and implements certain amendments to the Medicaid rebate statute created under the ACA. Further, the current U.S. Presidential administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures 
27

that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the current U.S. Presidential administration released a “Blueprint”, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General, proposed modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. While some of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the current U.S. Presidential administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Any additional healthcare reform measures could further constrain our business and/or limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product portfolio or additional pricing pressures. 
Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
Other Regulatory Requirements
We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
