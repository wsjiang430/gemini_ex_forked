ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
The Company is a Delaware corporation which was incorporated on November 15, 1988, under the name “Europa Cruises Corporation.” In 1989, the Company became a publicly-held company. On November 22, 2002, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to change its name to “Diamondhead Casino Corporation.” The Company currently has three subsidiaries.
 
The Company has no current operations in any state. The Company has had no income or revenue from any operations since 2000. The Company currently has only one employee who serves in an executive officer capacity.
 
For the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, the Company’s limited resources were consumed by extensive litigation relating to various lawsuits and unsuccessful efforts to obtain financing. See item 3; Legal Proceedings.
 
Mississippi
 
The Company owns, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Mississippi Gaming Corporation, an approximate 400-acre undeveloped property located at 7051 Interstate 10, Diamondhead, Mississippi 39525 (hereafter “the Diamondhead Property” or “the Property”). The Company’s intent was to construct a casino resort and other amenities on the Property unilaterally or, in conjunction with one or more joint venture partners. However, the Company has been unable, to date, to obtain financing to move the project forward and/or enter into a joint venture partnership. There can be no assurance that the substantial funds required for the design and construction of the project can be obtained or that such funds can be obtained on acceptable terms. In addition, the Company has been unable to obtain financing to sustain the Company. Due to its lack of financial resources and certain lawsuits filed by creditors against the Company, the Company has been forced to explore other alternatives, including a sale of part or all of the Property. The Company’s preference is to sell only part of the Property inasmuch as this would appear to be in the best interest of the stockholders of the Company. However, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to sell only part of the Property. The Company intends to continue to pursue a joint venture partnership and/or other financing while seeking a viable purchaser for part or all of the Property. Finally, there can be no assurance that if the requisite financing for the project were obtained and the project were constructed, that the project would be successful.
 
The Company has no current operations in Mississippi, no offices in Mississippi, and no employees in Mississippi.

Property Zoning
 
The Diamondhead Property is located entirely within the City of Diamondhead and Hancock County. The City of Diamondhead incorporated in February of 2012. On October 15, 2012, the Mayor and City Council adopted a Zoning Ordinance in which the City of Diamondhead zoned the entire Property as “C-2-Interstate Commercial/Gaming/Resort.” Thus, the requisite City zoning is currently in place for a casino.
 
Land-Based Gaming
 
All references in this section to Mississippi law are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual text of the law.
 
On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf coast of the United States causing extensive damage to Louisiana and Mississippi, including Biloxi, Gulfport, and Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. Hurricane Katrina damaged or destroyed most of the casinos on the Gulf coast. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, Mississippi law required that casinos on the Gulf coast be built in, on, or above the water and be located a minimum of fifty percent below mean high tide.
 
On October 17, 2005, in response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, Mississippi passed new legislation that allows casinos located in certain statutorily-described areas, including St. Louis Bay, where the Diamondhead Property is located, to be constructed on land no more than 800 feet from the mean high-water line. Under Mississippi’s new legislation, the part of the structure in which licensed gaming activities are conducted must be located entirely in an area which is located no more than eight hundred (800) feet from the mean high-water line (as defined in Section 29-15-1 of the Mississippi Code) of the waters within the State of Mississippi, which lie adjacent to the State of Mississippi south of the three (3) most southern counties in the State of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Sound, St. Louis Bay, Biloxi Bay and Pascagoula Bay or, with regard to Harrison County only, no farther north than the southern boundary of the right-of-way for U.S. Highway 90, whichever is greater. In the case of a structure that is located in whole or part on shore, the part of the structure in which licensed gaming activities are conducted must lie adjacent to state waters south of the three (3) most southern counties in the State of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Sound, St. Louis Bay, Biloxi Bay and Pascagoula Bay. When the site upon which the structure is located consists of a parcel of real property, easements and rights-of-way for public streets and highways are not construed to interrupt the contiguous nature of the parcel, nor is the footage contained within the easements and rights-of-way counted in the calculation of the distances specified above.
 
The Company intends to take advantage of the Mississippi legislation that allows casinos to be built on land.
 
Annual In-Lieu Tidelands Assessment
 
Since the Company intends to construct a casino on land in Mississippi, the Company will no longer require a tidelands lease from the Secretary of State. Under Mississippi’s prior law, which required that the Company’s casino be in, on, or above water and a minimum of fifty percent at or below mean high tide, the Company would have required a tidelands lease to lease water-bottoms owned by the State.
 
However, on or about October 17, 2005, when Mississippi passed new legislation permitting casinos to be built on land in certain locations, Mississippi also passed a companion law that requires any person possessing a license under the Mississippi Gaming Control Act, who operates a gaming establishment in any of the three most southern counties of the State (including Hancock County in which the Company’s Property is located), and who does not lease public trust tidelands from the State, to pay an annual in-lieu tidelands assessment to the Public Trust Tidelands Assessments Fund. For calendar year 2006, the annual in-lieu tidelands assessment was between $400,000 and $750,000, based on an escalating scale which is measured by the capital investment in the part of the structure in which the licensed gaming activities are conducted. For each calendar year thereafter, the Secretary of State is required to review and adjust the value of the capital investment and the annual in-lieu tidelands assessment due. Such review and adjustment shall be tied to the Consumer Price Index.
 
This annual in-lieu tidelands assessment will apply to any casino constructed on land on the Diamondhead Property.
 
Mississippi Gaming Site Approval
 
In the State of Mississippi, in addition to local zoning, a proposed gaming site must obtain Gaming Site Approval. Only the Mississippi Gaming Commission has the authority to grant Gaming Site Approval. On or about May 29, 2014, the title holder of the Property, Mississippi Gaming Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, applied for Gaming Site Approval for a fifty (50) acre site on the Diamondhead Property. In its Notice of Intent, the applicant anticipated the casino would contain approximately 1250 slot machines and approximately 40 table games and contain an estimated 80,000 square feet of gaming space. On August 21, 2014, the Mississippi Gaming Commission granted Gaming Site Approval to Mississippi Gaming Corporation for a fifty acre site on the Diamondhead Property.

The Mississippi Gaming Commission found, in pertinent part, as follows: 1) that in accordance with the Mississippi Gaming Control Act of 1990, codified as Miss. Code Ann. § 75-76-1 et seq., Miss. Code Ann. § 19-3-79, and Miss. Code Ann. §97-33-1, as amended, the citizens of Hancock County, Mississippi voted to authorize gaming in Hancock County, and thus gaming is legal at qualifying locations within Hancock County, Mississippi; that the proposed gaming area is within 800 feet of the mean high water line of the Bay of St. Louis and is thus a legal gaming site under the Mississippi Control Act of 1990, as amended, and 13 Mississippi Administrative Code Part 2 Rule 2.2(a)(1) and (3); and that the Proposed Site is properly zoned for gaming.
 
The Gaming Site Approval was granted for a period expiring three years after the date Approval to Proceed with Development is granted. The Property owner has not applied for Approval to Proceed with Development. Thus, the three year period has not yet begun to run.
 
Additional Permits, Authorizations and Approvals Are Required
 
In addition to Gaming Site Approval, the development of the Diamondhead Property requires the Company to obtain additional permits, authorizations and approvals from various federal, state, county, and/or city agencies, boards and commissions, which may include, but not be limited to, the following: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Coast Guard, Port and Harbor Commission, Mississippi Gaming Commission, Mississippi Department of Marine Resources, Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality, Mississippi Department of Transportation, Hancock County, and/or the City of Diamondhead. The regulatory environment relating to such permits, authorizations and approvals is uncertain and subject to constant change. There can be no assurance that all permits, authorizations and/or approvals can be obtained, or that if obtained, that they will be renewed. While there is no pending environmental litigation, the foregoing permits, authorizations and approvals remain subject to future litigation and the actions of environmental groups and various federal, state, county and/or local governments and agencies, including, but not limited to, the foregoing. The Company will be required to spend significant funds to pay the architects, surveyors, engineers, accountants, attorneys, consultants and other experts required to prepare and process the applications required for the permits, authorizations and approvals required. The amount ultimately required is unknown at this time, but the Company does not have any funds required for this purpose. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to obtain the funds required for this purpose or that it will be able to obtain the funds required on acceptable terms.
Uncertain Regulatory and Political Environment
 
The political environment in which the Company and/or its subsidiaries intend to operate is also uncertain, dynamic and subject to rapid change. Existing operators often propose and support legislation and/or litigation designed to make it difficult or impossible for competition to enter a market. This political and regulatory environment makes it impossible to predict the effects that the adoption of and changes in gaming laws, rules and regulations and/or competition will have on development of a gaming resort. Moreover, legislatures in states in which gaming is legal often consider wide-ranging legislation and regulations which could adversely affect operations and expected revenues. Likewise, the federal government often considers legislation which could adversely affect operations and expected revenues and certain states have legalized internet gaming. The long term effects of legalizing internet gaming on the casino industry in general and on the Company’s proposed casino operations are unknown.
 
Anti-Gaming Referenda
 
On at least three separate occasions since 1998, certain anti-gaming groups have proposed referenda that, if adopted, would have banned gaming in Mississippi and required that gaming entities cease operations within two years after the ban. All three of the proposed referenda were ruled illegal by Mississippi State trial courts. If such a referendum were to be approved by the voters, it would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
Mississippi Regulation
 
The Company has no current operations in Mississippi and does not operate any gaming facility in Mississippi. The Company intends to develop its Diamondhead property as a destination casino resort.
 
Assuming it is successful in developing its resort, the Company and its subsidiaries and/or affiliates will be subject to federal, state, county, city and local, laws, rules, ordinances and regulations with respect to the operation of any gaming facility. The following is intended to serve as a partial description of the Mississippi regulatory environment in which the Company or its subsidiaries or joint venture partner(s) would seek approvals to construct and operate a gaming facility and is not intended to be a complete, precise, or up-to-date recitation of all applicable laws, rules, regulations or ordinances that might affect the Company’s operations or with which the Company would be required to comply. Additional or more restrictive laws, rules and regulations could be adopted at any time or gambling could be completely banned.

The location of, ownership of, and operation of gaming facilities in Mississippi are subject to extensive state and local regulation, primarily through the licensing and control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission and the Mississippi State Tax Commission. The Company and/or its subsidiaries must register and be licensed under the Mississippi Gaming Control Act and its gaming operations will be subject to the regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, the Mississippi State Tax Commission and various state, county and local regulatory agencies.
 
The Mississippi Gaming Control Act gives the Mississippi Gaming Commission (the “Commission”) extensive power to enforce the Act and adopt regulations in furtherance of the Act (the “Mississippi Regulations”). The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of Mississippi and the Mississippi Gaming Commission seek to: (1) prevent unsavory or unsuitable persons from having any direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; (2) establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures; (3) maintain effective control over the financial practices of licensees, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and safeguarding of assets and revenues, providing reliable record keeping and making periodic reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission; (4) prevent cheating and fraudulent practices; (5) provide a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees; and (6) ensure that gaming licensees, to the extent practicable, employ Mississippi residents. The regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by the Commission. Changes in Mississippi law or the regulations or the Commission’s interpretation thereof may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and could have a material adverse effect on Mississippi gaming operations.
 
Approval Process
 
The Commission has divided the approval process into two separate phases: (1) gaming site approval; and (2) approval to proceed with development.
 
1. Gaming Site Approval
 
Mississippi Gaming Corporation, which holds title to the Property and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, obtained Gaming Site Approval on August 21, 2014. With respect to gaming site approval, approval constitutes only the Commission’s finding that the location complies with applicable gaming laws and regulations. Gaming site approval does not entitle the recipient to proceed with development, nor does it constitute a license to engage in gaming or a right to a gaming license. Gaming site approval is a revocable privilege and no holder acquires any vested right therein. The Mississippi Gaming Commission reserves the right to revoke any site approval should the circumstances change that would make the site illegal or unsuitable.
 
An application for gaming site approval in the three most southern counties must include evidence satisfactory to the Commission in support thereof including: (1) a survey indicating the specific location of the property; (2) the current use of any adjacent property as well as the location of the nearest residential area, church and school; (3) evidence that all applicable zoning ordinances allow gaming at the proposed site; and (4) a survey establishing the mean high water line, performed by a qualified surveyor for performance of tidal surveys.
 
Gaming establishments in the three most southern counties in the State of Mississippi, including Hancock County, are permitted to be permanent inland structures. No point in the gaming area may be more than eight hundred (800) feet from the nineteen (19) year mean high water line. Harrison County establishments south of Highway 90 may exceed the eight hundred (800) foot measurement up to the southern boundary of Highway 90. All public easements and rights-of-way for public streets and highways are excluded from the 800 foot measurement. Any point of reference used to determine the 800 foot distance from the mean high water line must be located on the applicant or licensee’s premises. The applicant or licensee must own and/or lease the land that is contiguous both to the parcel used to conduct gaming and the point of reference used to determine the mean high water line, and this land must be shown to be an integral part of the project. The Commission has final authority in reviewing and approving each site as it pertains to meeting the requirements of this regulation.

2. Approval to Proceed with Development
 
With respect to obtaining the Commission’s approval to proceed with development, the following information, together with documentation to support this information, must be submitted to the Commission:
 
1) Architectural plans or renderings showing details of all proposed construction and renovation for the project, together with a footprint of the project and a description of the construction and type of parking facilities, as well as parking lot capacity. Commission approval requires that the project include a 500-car, or larger parking facility in close proximity to the casino complex, and infrastructure facilities shall include a 300-room, or larger hotel of at least a three diamond rating as defined by an acceptable travel publication to be determined by the Commission. In addition, infrastructure facilities must include a restaurant capable of seating at least 200 people and a fine dining facility capable of seating at least 75 people, and the casino floor must be at least 40,000 square feet. The project will also have or support an amenity that will be unique to the market and will encourage economic development and promote tourism. The Commission will have authority in determining the quality of the amenity and the ultimate approval of the amenity, and may, in its discretion, reduce the requirements above should it determine that there is a justification to do so in certain markets. The Commission will further determine, in its discretion, if the prerequisite hotel and dining facilities may be supplanted by an amenity of high value to the overall tourism market in that the amenity will likely encourage economic development and promote tourism. As used herein, infrastructure facilities are not such items as parking facilities, roads, sewage and water systems, or civic facilities normally provided by cities and/or counties.
 
The qualifying infrastructure must be owned or leased by; (i) the holder of the site approval, or (ii) an affiliated company of the holder of the site approval where both the affiliated company and the holder of the site approval have identical direct or indirect equity ownership. This regulation shall apply to any new applicant for a gaming license for a new gaming facility and to the acquisition or purchase of a licensee or gaming facility for which gaming operations have ceased prior to the time of acquisition or purchase. It does not apply to any licensee, who has been licensed by the Commission, or to any person which has received Approval to Proceed with Development from the Commission prior to December 31, 2013 (or to such licensee upon any licensing renewal after such date.)
 
Any change to the plan, or placement or design of the establishment, cruise vessel or vessel, shall be submitted in advance to the Executive Director for determination of whether such a change constitutes a material change. If the Executive Director determines that a material change has occurred, Commission approval is required for same.
 
2) Statements reflecting the total estimated cost of construction or renovation of the establishment, vessel, or cruise vessel and shore and dock facilities, distinguishing between known costs and projections, and separately identifying: facility design expense; land acquisition costs; site preparation costs; construction costs or renovation costs; equipment acquisition costs; costs of interim financing; organization, administrative and legal expenses; projected permanent financing costs; qualified infrastructure costs; and non-qualifying infrastructure costs.
 
3) A construction schedule for completion of the project, including an estimated date of project completion, indicating whether a performance bond will be required by the applicant to be furnished by the contractor.
 
4) Current financial statements, including, at a minimum, a balance sheet and profit and loss statement for the proposed licensee.
 
5) A detailed statement of the sources of funds for all construction and renovation proposed by the site development plans. Any funding, whether equity or debt, to be obtained, must be supported by firm written commitments satisfactory to the Commission. The applicant will have 120 days in which to close all financing and start construction or the approval is deemed void.
 
6) Evidence that the following agencies (if applicable) were notified of the development and/or do not oppose the site development: U.S. Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard, Mississippi Department of Transportation, Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Department of Marine Resources, Port and Harbor Commission, Levee Board, City and County government, and such other agencies as the Executive Director deems appropriate.
 
The application for a Gaming Operator’s License must be filed no later than ninety (90) days after the Commission grants approval to proceed with development. The gaming site approval will expire three (3) years from the date approval to proceed with development is granted unless the Commission grants an extension. Approval to proceed with development is not subject to sale, assignment or transfer.
 
Opening of a Casino
 
Before any gaming facility may open to the public, all infrastructure requirements must be fully operational. The development shall be completed in accordance with the approved plan and be ready for operation within the gaming site approval time period. Gaming site approval may be extended within the discretion of the Commission.
 
Application Information Required is Extensive and Must be Complete and Accurate
 
In addition to other information required by law and Commission regulations, an applicant must provide complete information regarding the proposed operation, including but not limited to, a certification that any establishment to be used by the proposed operation has been inspected and approved by all appropriate authorities; fingerprints for each individual applicant; the nature, source, and amount of any financing; the proposed uses of all available funds; the amount of funds available after opening for the actual operation of the establishment; and economic projections for the first three years of operation of the establishment. Each applicant must provide complete information regarding his or her background for the ten-year period preceding submission of the application.

Every application to become a license holder must contain the following additional information: actual establishment blueprints, including a layout of each floor stating the projected use of each area; the number of miles from the nearest population center and a description of transportation facilities serving that population center, a description of the casino size and configuration of slot machines, video games of chance and table games; a description of the availability of fire protection and the adequacy of law enforcement at the establishment and emergency evacuation plans for hurricane and flooding disasters; a description of the arrangements for food and drink concessions, the names and addresses of the concessionaires and the terms of the concession contracts, if applicable; the type of slot machines and video games of chance to be used and the proposed distributors and manufacturers of this equipment; a description of the physical location, size and floor plan of the section of the establishment reserved for patrons under 21 years of age and plans for activities and staffing for this section; periods of time that the gaming areas will be in operation; a description of the proposed management of the facility, management personnel by function, and tip distribution policies; all known feasibility studies made available to the applicant which have been done on the type of gaming in the particular locale where the applicant intends to conduct gaming, and a description of procurement policies that emphasize the utilization of Mississippi employees, resources, and goods and services in the operation of the gaming establishment.
 
Timetable for Financing and Construction
 
License applicants must submit, simultaneously with submission of their completed application, a timetable for financing arrangements (including applications for approval of public offerings or private placements), and commencement and completion of construction activities, setting forth the date upon which gaming activities will commence. The timetable will be subject to approval by the Commission and monitored for compliance by the Executive Director. The Commission may grant extensions of time upon the recommendation of the Executive Director. License applicants must not advertise or promote the opening of their proposed casino nor the commencement of employee training for their proposed casino until the applicant is granted a license by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. Applicants may request a waiver of this regulation from the Executive Director, which waiver, if granted would be subject to revocation.
 
Unsuitable Locations
 
The Executive Director may recommend that an application for a license be denied if the Executive Director believes that the place or location for which the license is sought is unsuitable for the conduct of gaming operations. The Commission may deny an application for a state gaming license if it deems that the place or location for which the license is sought is unsuitable for the conduct of gaming operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following locations may be deemed unsuitable: premises located within the immediate vicinity of residential areas, churches, schools and children’s public playgrounds; premises where gaming is contrary to any county or city ordinance, including, but not limited to, zoning ordinances restricting the permissible locations for gaming facilities, so long as such ordinances do not have the effect of absolutely excluding or prohibiting legal gaming; premises which fail to meet federal, state or local health and safety standards, and any other applicable laws or regulations; premises frequented by minors; premises lacking adequate supervision or surveillance; premises difficult to police or where adequate fire protection may be difficult; any other premises where the conduct of gaming would be inconsistent with the public policy of the State of Mississippi.
Building Standards
 
Any establishment to be constructed for gaming will be required to meet the Southern Standard Building Code. If the local county or city has a building code, then the local code will be the applicable standard. The Commission requires, as a condition of licensure, that gaming establishments meet strict hurricane emergency standards and procedures.
 
Objection by County or Municipality
 
Whenever the Commission receives a completed application for a gaming license proposing to operate a gaming establishment in a particular county or municipality, the Executive Director, within ten days after receipt of the application, must notify the board of supervisors of the county and, if applicable, the chief executive of the municipality in which the proposed operation will be located of the receipt of the application and specify the name of the applicant and the proposed location for the gaming establishment. The county or municipality in which the applicant proposes to operate may file a duly enacted resolution specifying any objections or endorsements with the Executive Director.

Individual Licensing of Shareholders of Corporate Licensee
 
The Commission may request persons, affiliated entities and greater than 5% equity owners to submit an application for finding of suitability in which event the application must be submitted within thirty days of the request.
 
All Officers and Directors of a Corporation Must be Licensed
 
All officers and directors of a corporation which holds or applies for a state gaming license must be licensed individually and, if in the judgment of the Mississippi Gaming Commission the public interest will be served by requiring any or all of the corporation’s individual stockholders, lenders, holders of evidence of indebtedness, underwriters, key executives, agents, or employees to be licensed, the corporation shall require such persons to apply for a license. An officer or director shall apply for a license within thirty days after he becomes an officer or director. A person required to be licensed pursuant to a decision of the commission must apply for a license within thirty days after the executive director requests him to do so.
 
Licensing is a Privilege and Revocable
 
It is the declared policy of the State of Mississippi that all establishments where gambling games are conducted or operated must be licensed and controlled so as to better protect the public health, safety, morals, good order and welfare of its inhabitants. Any license, registration, finding of suitability, or approval by the Commission is deemed to be a revocable privilege and no person holding such a license, registration, finding of suitability, or approval is deemed to have any vested rights therein.
 
An application for a state gaming license or any other affirmative Commission action is seeking the granting of a privilege and the burden of proving his qualification to receive any license, registration, finding of suitability or approval, is at all times on the applicant. The applicant must document compliance with all applicable federal, state and local rules, regulations and permit requirements. An applicant must accept any risk of adverse publicity, embarrassment, criticism, or other action, or financial loss which may result from action with respect to an application and expressly waive any claim for damages as a result thereof. An application for a license, finding of suitability, or registrations constitutes a request to the Executive Director for a recommendation and to the Commission for a decision upon the applicant’s general suitability, character, integrity, and ability to participate or engage in, or be associated with, the gaming industry in the manner or position sought by the application, or the manner or position generally similar thereto.
 
Certain Commission Considerations for Licensing
 
The Commission will consider various factors when deciding whether to issue a license to conduct gaming in an establishment, including but not limited to, the following: revenue provided by a facility to the state and local communities through direct taxation on its operation and indirect revenues from tourism, ancillary businesses, creation of new industry and taxes on employees and patrons. It will consider whether the proposed establishment is: economically viable and properly financed, planned in a manner that provides for adequate security for all aspects of its operation and for people working, visiting, or traveling to the establishment; planned in a manner which promotes efficient and safe operation; is planned in a manner that provides efficient, safe, and enjoyable use by patrons of the establishment and parking facilities, concessions, the casino, access to cashier windows and rest rooms; compliance with state and federal laws regarding fire, health, construction, zoning, and other similar matters; whether the applicant will employ the persons necessary to operate the establishment in a manner consistent with the needs, safety, and interests of persons who will be in the establishment; the population of the area to be served by the establishment and the location of other establishments within and without the state. The Commission will consider the character and reputation of all persons identified with ownership and operation of the establishment and their capability to comply with rules of the Commission and the Mississippi Code; whether the proposed operation will maximize development; whether it is beneficial to Mississippi tourism, the number and quality of employment opportunities for Mississippians created and promoted by the proposed operation, and the amount and type of shore developments associated with the establishment.
 
A license which authorizes a holder to operate a gaming establishment is granted for no longer than three years from the date of issue and may be granted for a period of less than three years based within the discretion of the Commission.

Gaming Licenses
 
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has a license to operate a casino in Mississippi or in any other jurisdiction. Gaming licenses require the periodic payment of fees and taxes and are not transferable except in accordance with applicable Mississippi law and regulations and with the prior approval of the Commission. Gaming licenses in Mississippi are issued for a maximum term of three years and must be renewed periodically thereafter. There can be no assurance that the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be licensed. There can be no assurance that if licensed, new licenses can be obtained at the end of any particular licensure period. Moreover, the Commission may, at any time, and for any cause it deems reasonable, revoke, suspend, condition or limit a license or approval to own shares of stock in a company that operates in Mississippi. The Mississippi Act also requires that a publicly traded company register under the Act. The Company and/or its subsidiaries will be required to periodically submit detailed financial, operating and other reports to the Commission and Mississippi State Tax Commission. A violation under a gaming license held by a subsidiary of a Company operating in Mississippi could be deemed a violation of all other licenses, if any, then held by the Company. Numerous transactions, including substantially all loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions entered into by any subsidiary of the Company operating a casino in Mississippi must be reported to or approved by the Commission. In addition, the Commission may, at its discretion, require additional information about the operations of the Company.
 
Deborah Vitale, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, though not currently licensed, previously held a gaming license in Colorado.
 
Finding of Suitability
 
The following persons must apply for a finding of suitability and must be found suitable by the Commission in order to be involved with a licensee: i) each person who serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors of any corporation, public or private, licensed or registered by the Commission; and ii) each person who has a vote on any issue before the Board of Directors of any corporation, public or private, licensed or registered by the Commission and who is also an employee of the corporation or any of its subsidiaries. In addition, the following persons shall apply for a finding of suitability: i) each person who serves as Chairman of the audit or compliance committee of any corporation, public or private, licensed or registered by the Commission, and ii) any executive, employee, or agent of a gaming licensee that the Commission determines as having the power to exercise a significant influence over decisions concerning any part of the operation of a gaming licensee. If the nature of the job changes from that for which the applicant is found suitable, he may be required to submit himself to a new determination of her or his suitability.
 
The Commission can require any employee to be found suitable if it finds that the public interest and policies set forth in the Act will be served thereby. The Commission is not restricted by job titles, but will consider the functions and responsibilities of the person, including but not limited to, persons acting in the capacity of a property level general manager, assistant general manager, or executive level personnel actively and directly engaged in the administration or supervision of the activities of a licensee. Any executive, employee or agent of a gaming licensee who is listed or should be listed in an annual employee report may be required to apply for a finding of suitability.
 
A finding of suitability is granted for a period of no longer than ten years from the date of issue. A finding of suitability may be granted for a period of less than ten years within the discretion of the Commission. A holder of a finding of suitability must file with the Investigations Division of the Commission by June 30th of each year, the “Investigations Division Annual Report,” providing all information requested on forms provided by the Commission and any other information requested by the Executive Director. A holder of a finding of suitability must immediately inform the Commission of any arrest or conviction.
 
The Commission has full and absolute power and authority, at any time, to deny any application or limit, condition, restrict, revoke, or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability or approval, or fine any person licensed, registered, found suitable or approved, for any cause deemed reasonable by the commission. The Commission has the power, at any time, to investigate and require the finding of suitability of any record or beneficial stockholder of the Company. The Act requires that each person who, individually or in association with others, acquires, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of a publicly traded corporation registered with the Mississippi Gaming Commission, must notify the Mississippi Gaming Commission of this acquisition. The Act also requires that each person who, individually or in association with others acquires, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of more than 10% of any class of voting securities of a publicly traded corporation registered with the Commission must be found suitable by the Mississippi Gaming Commission and pay the costs and fees that the Commission incurs in conducting the investigation. Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within thirty days after being ordered to do so by the Commission may be found unsuitable. Any person found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of the Company’s securities beyond such time as the Commission prescribes, may be guilty of a misdemeanor.
 
The Company may be required to disclose to the Commission upon request, the identities of holders of any debt or other securities. Under the Act, the Commission may, in its discretion, (1) require holders of debt securities of registered corporations to file applications; (2) investigate such holders; and (3) require the holders to be found suitable to own such securities.
 
The Mississippi regulations provide that a change in control of a Company may not occur without the prior approval of the Commission. Mississippi law prohibits the Company from making a public offering of its securities without the approval of the Commission if any part of the proceeds of the offering is to be used to finance the construction, acquisition or operation of gaming facilities in Mississippi or to retire or extend obligations incurred for one or more such purposes. The Commission has the authority to grant a continuous approval of securities offerings subject to renewal every three years by certain issuers.

Employees associated with gaming in Mississippi must obtain work permits that are subject to immediate suspension under certain circumstances. The Commission will refuse to issue a work permit to a person who has been convicted of a felony, committed certain misdemeanors or knowingly violated the Mississippi Gaming Control Act, and it may refuse to issue a work permit to a gaming employee for any other reasonable cause.
 
The Company believes there may be persons with prior felony convictions, who are affiliated with certain shareholders, who beneficially own in excess of 5% of a class of voting stock of the Company, who may be found unsuitable by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. Article X of the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, as amended, provides that the “Company may repurchase or redeem shares, at fair market value, held by any person or entity whose status as a shareholder, in the opinion of the Company’s Board of Directors, jeopardizes the approval, continued existence, or renewal by any gaming regulatory authority, of a contract to manage gaming operations, or any other tribal, federal or state license or franchise held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.” However, there can be no assurance the Company would have sufficient funds to purchase shares held by such a person or entity. In the event the Company was unable to purchase such shares, its ability to obtain a license could be materially and adversely affected.
 
License Fees and Taxes
 
License fees and taxes are payable to the State of Mississippi and to the counties and cities in which the Mississippi Gaming Subsidiary’s respective operations will be conducted. The license fee payable to the State of Mississippi is based upon “gaming receipts,” which are generally defined as gross receipts less payouts to customers as winnings. The fee equals 4% of the first $50,000 or less of gross revenue per calendar month, plus 6% of the next $84,000 of gross revenue per calendar month, plus 8% of gross revenue over $134,000 per calendar month. License fees paid in any taxable year are allowed as a credit against the Mississippi State income tax liability of a licensee for that taxable year.
 
A licensee must pay an annual license fee of $5,000. In addition, each licensee must pay a license fee based on the number of games it operates. If it operates over 35 games, the fee is equal to $81,200 plus $100 for each game over 35 games. In addition to state gaming license fees or taxes, a municipality or county may impose a gross revenue fee upon a licensee based on all gaming receipts derived from the establishment equal to approximately 4%. An additional license tax may apply to gaming devices.
 
Beer, Wine and Liquor Licensing
 
The sale of alcoholic beverages by casinos, including beer and wine, is subject to licensing, regulation and control by both the local jurisdiction and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division (the “ABC”) of the Mississippi Department of Revenue. All licenses are revocable and non-transferable. The ABC has full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license, and any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a material adverse impact upon the operations of an affected casino, its financial condition and its results of operations.
 
Extensive Non-Gaming Laws and Regulations
 
In addition to the foregoing, the Company and/or its subsidiaries will be subject to additional federal, state, county and city, safety, food, alcohol, health, employment, and other laws, rules, regulations and ordinances that apply to non-gaming businesses generally. In addition, Regulations adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Treasury Department require currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day to be reported, including identification of the patron by name and social security number. Substantial penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these and numerous other regulations. The foregoing is just one example of the pervasiveness of the non-gaming laws, rules, regulations and ordinances that would apply to a casino operator.
 
Competition
 
There is intense competition in the Mississippi market in which the Company intends to operate and in surrounding markets. The Company will compete directly with other existing gaming facilities located in Mississippi and in bordering states, including Louisiana. In addition, there may be additional casinos opening on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi and in Diamondhead where the Company’s Property is located. The Company will also be competing directly and indirectly, with gaming facilities throughout the United States and throughout the world, as well as with Native American gaming operations which enjoy certain tax advantages. The Company expects this competition to increase as new gaming operators enter these markets, existing competitors expand their operations, gaming activities expand in existing jurisdictions, gaming is legalized in new jurisdictions, and legalized gaming expands on the internet. Assuming it is successful in developing a destination casino resort, the Company will also be competing with other forms of gaming and entertainment, including but not limited to, bingo, online gambling, pull tab games, card parlors, sports-book operations, pari-mutuel betting, dog racing, lotteries, jai-alai, video lottery terminals, and video poker terminals.

Louisiana Competition
 
The Company believes that its greatest competition will come from any existing and any new casinos that might be constructed in or around Diamondhead, Bay St. Louis, Gulfport and Biloxi, Mississippi due to their close proximity to the Diamondhead Property. While the Company’s primary competition will come from the foregoing, the Company’s Diamondhead, Mississippi casino will also compete with casinos and other gaming located in the adjacent State of Louisiana.
 
Louisiana has four land-based casinos. Inasmuch as the Company’s casino will be land-based, the Company’s primary competition is expected to come from Harrah’s land-based casino located in downtown New Orleans. This casino is approximately one hour from the Diamondhead site. Three of the land-based casinos in Louisiana are Indian casinos, which are located in Marksville in central Louisiana and in Kinder and Charenton in southern Louisiana. These are not expected to represent significant competition because of their distance from the Diamondhead site.
 
Based on the Louisiana Gaming Control Board’s 21st Annual Report to the Louisiana State Legislature for 2017, there are fifteen riverboat casinos authorized to operate in Louisiana. There are six riverboat casinos in the Shreveport-Bossier City area, which is about 360 miles from the Diamondhead Property; three in Lake Charles, which is approximately 246 miles from the Diamondhead Property; three in East Baton Rouge Parish, which is approximately 123 miles from the Diamondhead Property; and one each in Kenner, Harvey and Amelia, which are approximately 73, 71, and 139 miles, respectively, from the Diamondhead Property. As of June 30, 2016, there were approximately 1,798 video poker outlets and 13,160 video poker devices in the 31 parishes in Louisiana where video poker gaming had been approved in the local option election of November 5, 1996. These machines are authorized in bars, restaurants, hotels, off-track betting parlors and truck stops. Louisiana also has slot machine gaming at racetracks. Louisiana generated direct gaming revenue of $705,517,316, a decrease of $8,341,668 from the previous fiscal year. Riverboat gaming continues to be the most dominant area in gaming in Louisiana, providing more than half of the state’s gaming revenue. The cumulative effect of the foregoing could be seen as having a significant competitive effect on the Diamondhead Property project.
