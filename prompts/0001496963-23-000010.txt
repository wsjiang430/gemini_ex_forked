Overview
Squarespace enables anyone to stand out and succeed online. Our domains, website, marketing, and social media management tools provide an online presence with best-in-class design and a consistent brand experience. Our commerce solutions include tools for selling digital content, classes, appointments, reservations, physical goods, and more. We facilitate an intuitive, seamless user experience across products and provide a unified view of analytics.
Our mission is twofold - for the ease of use of our products to provide anyone the ability to participate in the opportunity that comes from publishing and transacting on the internet, and for our design-centric and comprehensive tools to help them stand out and succeed. Customers across industries and ranging from sole proprietors to iconic brands, leverage our offerings to springboard their creations and showcase their talents. With a mission measured by the success of customers, we are aligned with our customers and focused on solving their challenges - their success drives our success. 
We believe the need for online presence and commerce is growing and that the usability and flexibility of our solutions allow us to help more entrepreneurial dreams become reality. As of December 31, 2022, we had more than 4.2 million unique subscriptions, an increase of 3% relative to December 31, 2021, on our platform across more than 200 countries and territories.
Our expanding set of solutions also provides customers with more ways to connect with their audiences and transact online, and streamlines their marketing and business operations. We believe we have a predictable business model with 92% of our revenue derived from subscriptions, stable customer acquisition and the adoption by our existing customers of additional offerings and add-on subscriptions to grow and scale with our platform as their needs evolve. We generated in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively:
•revenue of $867.0 million and $784.0 million;
•net (loss)/income of $(252.2) million and $(249.1) million;
•adjusted EBITDA of $147.5 million and $125.1 million;
•net cash provided by operating activities of $164.2 million and $123.2 million; and
•unlevered free cash flow of $165.6 million and $122.4 million.

Key Strengths
Squarespace is focused on what customers need to stand out and succeed online, and on making that simple with comprehensive, easy-to-use solutions. 
•Unmatched Design:  We believe design is the ultimate competitive advantage for succeeding online. Squarespace offers beautifully-designed templates and Fluid Engine, our flexible content editing system, gives users creative freedom and customization with design guidance. Customers easily achieve a bespoke website that stands out, and their brand choices can be seamlessly and consistently applied across digital channels, including social media and marketing campaigns.
•Everything to Sell Anything:  Our ambition is to enable entrepreneurial dreams to become reality, and entrepreneurs have endless types of ideas to bring to life. Our flexible product suite supports a diverse set of use cases. Customers can sell digital content, classes, appointments, reservations, physical goods, and more. Customers can also adopt multiple ways of selling. For example, a customer could get paid for client bookings, sell memberships to original content like video classes, and offer custom merchandise.
•Simplify:  The power of our solutions would not meet its potential unless the user experience is intuitive and seamless. We seek to make it easy for customers of varying degrees of technical, marketing, and business sophistication to build, market, and grow their business online. We also seek to provide a simplified experience that they might otherwise have to pull together from disparate systems. We provide customers with their website and online commerce functionality, a content management system, social media management tools, domain name service, professional email and marketing tools, and analytics for actionable business insights.

convenience, customers can update their websites, process orders and manage their businesses on-the-go with the Squarespace app.

We provide support in six languages across eight time zones. We also produce self-help resources, including guides, video tutorials and webinars.
Growth Strategies
The scale of our ambition — to provide an online path to success for anyone’s idea and have expansive solutions for each phase of their journey — has inherent growth potential. We intend to pursue the following strategies to meet the needs of existing and prospective customers.
•Acquire new customers: We believe there is a large opportunity for affordable, easy-to-use cloud-based solutions for online presentation and marketing, transacting, and managing businesses of all types. We intend to continue to invest in effective marketing and targeted use of sales operations. We also will continue to invest in product development to make our offerings easier to use and able to service more use cases, both of which expand the number of customers who can find success with our solutions. 
•Expand our solutions for businesses, particularly services-based businesses: Services-based businesses span a range of industries, including photography, interior design, massage therapy, beauty salons, fitness, event planning, home repair, restaurants, and wineries, among many more. With Squarespace, Acuity, and Tock, we have a foothold in services commerce and we intend to expand and deepen functionality that will provide services-based businesses with a comprehensive set of tools that is easy to use and manage, helping them to grow their businesses. We believe this strategy will increase new customers on higher value plans and encourage existing customers to adopt more of our solutions and transact in our ecosystem. We also intend to continue to invest in product development and solutions that benefit commerce customers of all types, whether service sellers who transact in multiple ways or sellers of physical or digital goods.
•Deepen relationships with existing customers:  As we continue to innovate and broaden our suite of solutions, we believe that we create significant incremental opportunities to serve more of our customers’ needs. We plan to increase awareness and adoption of our add-on offerings, including Email Campaigns and the ability to monetize digital content and products. We also believe that ongoing investment in our partner ecosystem and integrations will allow us to deliver more value to our customers. 
•Acquire new customers internationally: We believe there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand usage of our solutions outside of the United States. We will continue to invest in our international go-to-market strategies and product localization efforts. As of December 31, 2022, we serve customers in over 200 countries and territories and approximately 30% of our bookings are from outside of the United States.
•Continue to support our Enterprise offering:  Enterprise includes both larger businesses looking to build an online presence and volume customers who may require scalable solutions for many websites. We believe our Enterprise business is a long-term growth opportunity for Squarespace and will continue to invest in the marketing, product development, and dedicated customer support. In addition, we offer enterprise programs for our Acuity Scheduling and hospitality customers.
•Expand our experts community:  We remain focused on cultivating and growing our Circle program, comprised of experts that build sites for others on our platform. The community is a customer acquisition channel and we provide these experts with knowledge, tools and support that they leverage to find clients and grow their businesses.
•Strategic acquisitions:  We will continue to assess potential acquisition targets that support our mission and expand our service and product offerings for entrepreneurs.

Technology
We have engineered a modern technology infrastructure that has a high level of scalability, security, and resiliency to support our customers. We host our modern infrastructure through a hybrid of cloud service providers and data centers. We manage site hosting, software upgrades, network connectivity, content delivery network deployment, and Domain Name Systems on behalf of our customers.

We regularly run security assessments and penetration tests against our infrastructure, testing for security weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Squarespace’s built-in commerce tools have been certified as a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”) Level 1-compliant service provider, which is the highest level of compliance available. We also implement technology, such as Two-Factor Authentication and Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) certificates to keep our customer websites and data secure.

Human Capital
Our mission requires exceptional employees united in our common pursuit. We strive to attract top talent and provide an environment where they are inspired to do their best work.

Of these employees, 1,590 are located in the United States, 184 are located in the European Union, 22 are located in Australia, and 4 are located in the United Kingdom. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
We believe that a diverse employee population helps ensure new ideas and perspectives and that an inclusive culture helps ensure that those ideas and perspectives can thrive in order to deliver the best solutions to our customers. Employees have opportunities to voice their questions and thoughts in a variety of ways, including company and department-wide meetings and employee engagement surveys. We make diversity and inclusion and inclusive leadership learning opportunities accessible to all employees and our employee resource group (“ERG”) program provides a supportive community for ERG members and brings awareness and education to the broader company, helping to foster an inclusive culture. 
Squarespace Learning, our employee development program, allows employees to explore personalized content through a curated learning path, and our talent accelerator program provides selected participants in-depth coaching on leadership and development. 
We offer industry competitive compensation and benefits. Our annual compensation review coincides with our employee feedback cycle where employees and managers discuss performance to facilitate learning and career development.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secret, trademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property laws to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on contractual arrangements, such as licenses, assignments, and confidentiality agreements, and technical measures.
We have federally registered trademarks, including “Squarespace,” marks related to certain of our other brands, and related logos. We hold domestic and international domain name registrations that include “Squarespace” and similar variations.
We control access to our intellectual property and confidential information through internal and external controls.

We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors.

Government Regulations
The legal environment of internet-based businesses, both in the United States and internationally, is evolving rapidly and is often unclear. This ambiguity includes topics such as data privacy and security, pricing, advertising, taxation, content regulation, and intellectual property ownership and infringement.
We are subject to several local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection. Regulators around the world have adopted or proposed limitations on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personal information, payment card information or other confidential information of individuals and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the online collection, use and dissemination of data. In the event of a security breach, these laws may subject us to incident response, notice and remediation costs. Failure to safeguard data adequately or to destroy data securely could subject us to regulatory investigations or enforcement actions under applicable data security, unfair practices or consumer protection laws. The scope and interpretation of these laws could change and the associated burdens and our compliance costs could increase in the future.
We are also subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that govern or restrict our business and activities in certain countries and with certain persons, including the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (“FCPA”) and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (“U.K. Bribery Act”).
