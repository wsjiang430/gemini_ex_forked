Item 1. Business. 
 We are a diversified business with two focuses:
  
• | specialty finance company that provides funding to nonprofit community associations primarily located in the state of Florida. We offer incorporated nonprofit community associations, which we refer to as “Associations,” a variety of financial products customized to each Association’s financial needs. Our original product offering consists of providing funding to Associations by purchasing their rights under delinquent accounts that are selected by the Associations arising from unpaid Association assessments. Historically, we provided funding against such delinquent accounts, which we refer to as “Accounts,” in exchange for a portion of the proceeds collected by the Associations from the account debtors on the Accounts. We have started purchasing Accounts on varying terms tailored to suit each Association’s financial needs, including under our New Neighbor Guaranty™ program.

Specialty Finance Company
 We purchase Associations’ right to receive a portion of the Association’s collected proceeds from owners that are not paying their assessments. After taking assignment of an Association’s right to receive a portion of the Association’s proceeds from the collection of delinquent assessments, we engage law firms to perform collection work on a deferred billing basis wherein the law firms receive payment upon collection from the account debtors or a predetermined contracted amount if payment from account debtors is less than legal fees and costs owed. Under this business model, we typically fund an amount equal to or less than the statutory minimum an Association could recover on a delinquent account for each Account, which we refer to as the “Super Lien Amount”. Upon collection of an Account, the law firm working on the Account, on behalf of the Association, generally distributes to us the funded amount, interest, and administrative late fees, with the law firm retaining legal fees and costs collected, and the Association retaining the balance of the collection. In connection with this line of business, we have developed proprietary software for servicing Accounts, which we believe enables law firms to service Accounts efficiently and profitably.
 Under the New Neighbor Guaranty program, an Association will generally assign substantially all of its outstanding indebtedness and accruals on its delinquent units to us in exchange for payment by us of monthly dues on each delinquent unit. This simultaneously eliminates a substantial portion of the Association’s balance sheet bad debts and assists the Association to meet its budget by receiving guaranteed monthly payments on its delinquent units and relieving the Association from paying legal fees and costs to collect its bad debts. We believe that the combined features of the program enhance the value of the underlying real estate in an Association and the value of an Association’s delinquent receivables. We intend to leverage our proprietary software platform, as well as our industry experience and knowledge gained from our original line of business, to expand the New Neighbor Guaranty program in certain situations and to potentially develop other new products in the future.
 Because we acquire and collect on the delinquent receivables of Associations, the Account debtors are third parties about whom we have little or no information. Therefore, we cannot predict when any given Account will be paid off or how much it will yield. In assessing the risk of purchasing Accounts, we review the property values of the underlying units, the governing documents of the relevant Association, and the total number of delinquent receivables held by the Association.
 Specialty Finance Products
 Original Product
 Our original product relies upon Florida statutory provisions that effectively protect the principal amount invested by us in each Account. In particular, Section 718.116(1), Florida Statutes, makes purchasers and sellers of a unit in an Association jointly and severally liable for all past due assessments, interest, late fees, legal fees, and costs payable to the Association. As discussed above, the statute grants to Associations a so-called “super lien”, which is a category of lien that is given a statutorily higher priority than all other types of liens other than property tax liens. Under the Florida statute, a Florida Association’s super lien has higher priority than all other lien holders, except that in the case of property tax liens. The amount of the Association’s priority over a first mortgage holder that takes title to a property through foreclosure (or deed in lieu), referred to as the Super Lien Amount, is limited to twelve months’ past due assessments or, if less, one percent (1.0%) of the original mortgage amount. Under our contracts with Associations for our original product, we pay Associations an amount up to the Super Lien Amount for the right to receive all collected interest and late fees on Accounts purchased from the Associations.

In other states in which we have offered our original product, which are currently only in Washington, Colorado and Illinois, we rely on statutes that we believe are similar to the above-described Florida statutes in relevant respects. A total of approximately 22 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia have super lien statutes that give Association assessments super lien status under some circumstances, and of these states, we believe that all of these jurisdictions other than Alaska have a regulatory and business environment that would enable us to offer our original product to Associations in those states on materially the same basis. 
 New Neighbor Guaranty
 In 2012, we began development of a new product, the New Neighbor Guaranty, wherein an Association assigns substantially all of its outstanding indebtedness and accruals on its delinquent units to us in exchange for payments in an amount equal to the regular ongoing monthly or quarterly assessments for delinquent units when those amounts would be due to the Association. We assume both the payment and collection obligations for these assigned Accounts under this product. This simultaneously eliminates an Association’s balance sheet bad debts and assists the Association to meet its budget by receiving guaranteed assessment payments on its delinquent units and relieving the Association from paying legal fees and costs to collect its bad debts. We believe that the combined features of the product enhance the value of the underlying real estate in an Association and the value of an Association’s delinquent receivables.
 Before we implement the New Neighbor Guaranty program, an Association typically asks us to conduct a review of its accounts receivable. After we have conducted the review, we inform the Association which Accounts we are willing to purchase and the terms of such purchase. Once we implement the New Neighbor Guaranty program, we begin making scheduled payments to the Association on the Accounts as if the Association had non-delinquent residents occupying the units underlying the Accounts. Our New Neighbor Guaranty contracts typically allow us to retain all collection proceeds on each Account other than special assessments and accelerated assessment balances. Thus, the Association foregoes the potential benefit of a larger future collection in exchange for the certainty of a steady stream of immediate payments on the Account.
 Future Products
 We are also developing other variations of our contracts with Associations in various states that we may introduce to the market in the future. For example, under one product under development, at the request of an Association lender we may contract with an Association to provide that the Association will have revenues equal to or more than 90% of budget or any other percentage the lender requests. If an Association is at 80% of budget and a lender requires it to maintain revenues of 90% of budget, this product would provide upfront capital to bring the Association to the 90% threshold and then make continuing payments to keep it there through the term of the loan. This minimizes the lender’s risk of delinquencies adversely affecting the loan’s repayment. Also, this would enable lenders to do business with more Associations than their previous underwriting guidelines would permit if Associations contract with us as part of the loan package. This product, along with other variations on our contracts with Associations in various states, remains under development, however, and there is no assurance that we will ultimately launch this product or any other variation on our contracts with Associations in any state.
Specialty Finance Industry Overview
 According to the Community Association Institute (“CAI”), as of January 2016, 65 million people lived in 328,500 Associations in the United States. As a percentage, homeowners associations accounted for between 51-55% of the total and condominium associations accounted for between 42-45% of the total, with cooperatives comprising the balance. As of December 2016, Florida had nearly eight million residents living in more than 47,000 community associations. Assuming the national distribution of property types exists in Florida, Florida has approximately 24,000 homeowners associations and 20,000 condominium associations. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we contracted with approximately 500 community associations. We believe opportunity remains abundant in our other geographic markets. 
 Associations typically address delinquencies by paying lawyers or collection agencies to recover amounts owed. While Associations seek recovery of delinquent amounts, budgets go underfunded causing the need to cut services or raise assessments further. The real estate downturn in 2008 made delinquency issues an acute problem for a large number of Associations. We were organized in 2008 to immediately address the financial problems faced by Associations as a result of delinquent unit owners.
 According to the CAI, as of December 2016, in Florida where we have primarily operated, Associations annually assess their residents $9 billion and nationwide, annual assessments by Associations are $65 billion. We believe we are the largest purchaser of delinquent Accounts in Florida, with total purchases of approximately $309 million over a ten-year period. The balance of delinquent Accounts are serviced by lawyers, collection companies, our competitors, or not serviced at all. We believe we offer Associations a better

financial solution to Account delinquencies and that Associations will increasingly turn to us and our products as a solution to handle Account delinquencies.
 Specialty Finance Strategy
 Our primary objective is to utilize our competitive strengths, including our proprietary technology and our management’s experience and expertise in buying and collecting Association Accounts, to grow our business in Florida and in other states by identifying, evaluating, pricing, and acquiring Association Accounts and maximizing collections of such Accounts in a cost efficient manner. The principal elements of our strategy and competitive advantage are as follows:

• | Capitalizing on our brand and existing strategic relationships to identify and acquire Association Accounts. We market our “We Buy Problems” and “You Are Always Better off with LM Funding” brands primarily through trade shows throughout Florida and, to a lesser extent, at national events. Participation in these shows and events has enabled us to form strategic relationships throughout the Association services industry and has served to provide a positive reputation in the industry. We leverage our brand and strategic relationships with law firms and Associations to identify and purchase Accounts.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Partnering with Associations’ advisors such as law firms, management companies, accountants, Association lenders, and others to efficiently identify and acquire Accounts on a national basis. The point of purchase for Accounts is at the individual Association board of directors level; therefore, establishing and maintaining relationships with the advisors of those boards is important to our business strategy. Our strategic relationships with Association boards’ advisors provide us with opportunities to meet with Association boards on favorable terms and help us to gain their trust and confidence.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providing our proprietary software to our partner law firms in order to cost effectively track, control, and collect purchased Accounts and maintain low fixed overhead. Our proprietary software provides a competitive advantage that enables law firms’ lawyers to efficiently handle approximately 1,000 accounts at a time with a high degree of uniformity and accuracy based upon historical caseload per lawyer of Business Law Group, P.A., one of our partner law firms. This enables our law firms to operate more efficiently and profitably, while simultaneously enabling us to cost effectively track and control our Accounts on a real-time basis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utilizing increased access to capital and lines of credit to expand our product offerings nationally. As a specialty finance company, capital is our inventory. Access to capital has always determined the speed of our growth and the amount of upfront funding we can provide with our products. We believe that increased access to capital will enable us to pursue more opportunities to buy Accounts and to develop a wider array of specialty finance products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extending secured commercial loans as a means to acquiring large blocks of Accounts. We intend to pursue the extension of secured loans to commercial partners who, as a condition of such loans, would be required to drive large blocks of accounts to us. Banks, management companies, law firms, and large Associations control large blocks of Accounts that we may be able to acquire if we help meet their capital needs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuing acquisitions of providers in the Association Account servicing industry. A number of smaller collection companies continue to operate in the community association market. Some have funded Accounts that we can acquire. Others have customer relationships which can serve as a valuable platform for selling our products. We will continue to explore opportunities to expand our footprint in both the states in which we operate and by looking to make strategic acquisitions in states we wish to expand to.

Specialty Health Insurance Industry Overview
 The international travel insurance industry is highly competitive with a number of companies providing such services ranging in size from billion dollar companies such as AXA Insurance to smaller specialized firms such as IIU.  The U.S. Travel Insurance Association estimated in 2016 that consumers spent approximately $2.8 billion on various types of travel insurance products, an increase of 19.1% from 2014.  The main types of travel insurance include: trip cancellation/interruption/delay; baggage loss/delay on personal effects insurance; travel medical insurance; medical evacuation insurance; and cancel for any reason coverage.
Specialty Health Insurance Strategy
 Our strategy is to expand our customer base by identifying business partners who focus on overseas citizens who travel to the United States that are currently underserved by other competitors and identifying other United Stated based travel providers who can increase revenues by partnering with IIU for providing travel insurance.
