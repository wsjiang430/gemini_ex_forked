ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
GENERAL
Asure is a provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management (“HCM”) software and services, delivered as Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) for small and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”). We offer the human resource (“HR”) tools necessary to build a thriving workforce, providing the resources to stay compliant with dynamic federal, state, and local tax jurisdictions and their respective labor laws, freeing cash flows so they can spend their financial capital on growing their businesses rather than administrative overhead that can impede growth. Our solutions also provide new ways for employers to connect with and to differentiate themselves with their employees in order to enhance their relationships with their talent. Asure’s HCM suite (“AsureHCM”) includes Payroll & Tax solutions, HR compliance and services, Time & Attendance software and data integrations that enable employers and their employees to enhance efficiencies and take advantage of value-added solutions. We offer these services directly and indirectly through our network of Reseller Partners.
From recruitment to retirement, our solutions help more than 100,000 SMBs across the United States. Approximately 15,000 of our clients are direct and the 85,000 remaining clients are indirect, as they have contracts with Reseller Partners who white label our solutions.
We strive to be the most trusted HCM resource to SMBs. We target less densely populated U.S. metropolitan cities where fewer of our competitors have a presence. Our solutions solve three primary challenges that prevent businesses from growing: HR complexity, allocation of human and financial capital, and the ability to build great teams. We have and will continue to invest in research and development to expand our solutions. Our solutions reduce the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity while managing the employment lifecycle.
We were incorporated in 1985 as a Delaware corporation and our principal executive offices are located at 405 Colorado Street, Suite 1800, Austin, Texas 78701. Our telephone number is (888) 323-8835 and our website is www.asuresoftware.com. Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, however we do post information on the investor relations page of our website that we believe may be of interest to our investors.
We make available free of charge, on or through our website, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these materials or furnish them to the SEC. Reports and other information we file with the SEC may also be viewed at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. 
SOLUTIONS
Our solutions are primarily cloud-based and delivered as SaaS and HR services as well as professional services and hardware (time clocks and data collection devices).
Payroll and Tax. Asure Payroll & Tax is an integrated solution that provides a foundation for our clients’ digital HR strategy. We simplify payroll and automate and ensure compliance with the changing nature of regulations associated with payroll and taxes in all U.S. jurisdictions—from wages, benefits, overtime, and garnishments to tips, direct deposits, the Fair Labor Standard Act and federal, state, and local payroll taxes. Features include payroll taxes driven by up-to-date federal, state, and local tax tables and filing in a timely and accurate manner; adhering to annual filing requirements for Form W-2 and forms mandated by the Affordable Care Act; general ledger integration; managed garnishments and employee self-service.
Tax Management Solutions. Asure provides innovative payroll tax processing software and service solutions for the payroll service industry, mid-market and large corporate employers. With several scalable software and service options, from traditional full-service outsourcing to SaaS solutions, the extensive product line offers companies the ability to select a payroll tax solution that suits their needs. Asure’s Tax Management solutions also support bulk filing and processing of Employee Retention Tax credits.
Human Resource Compliance.  Asure handles HR complexities that SMBs face, including employee self-service, applicant tracking, onboarding and compliance with federal, state and local regulations. Asure provides three core levels of HR services: (i) HR support, which provides an on-demand HR resource library, phone and email support for any HR issues and compliance and policy updates; (ii) Strategic HR, which provides more in-depth support for strategic HR decision making; and (iii) Total HR, which provides a complete HR outsourcing solution.
Time and Attendance. Asure Time & Attendance combines with our complementary hardware (time clocks and data collection devices) to provide cost savings and potential return on investment gains in the form of a more strategic use of labor dollars and the elimination of time theft. Mobile time tracking helps executives better understand where and when their employees are working, providing insight into labor schedules and labor costs. With our mobile solution, employees can punch in and out from remote locations, as geo-positioning verifies their physical coordinates. Biometric time clocks, including facial recognition, reduce time theft and assists in the verification of the identities of workers. Automated system notifications, real-time dashboards, and flexible configuration options all work to streamline operations. Finally, employees, supervisors and executives have real-time access to data and business intelligence to optimize labor costing, improve labor scheduling, and control labor costs.
Asure Marketplace. AsureMarketplace™ automates interactions between our HCM systems with third-party providers to enhance efficiency, improve accuracy and to extend the range of services offered to employers and their employees. Asure has developed a large set of pre-built applications that businesses can connect with and has developed integrations with partners to exchange capabilities and data. These integrations enable businesses to communicate seamlessly and support a wide range of business-to-business and business-to-consumer applications. Business applications can include income verification and earned wage access. We are currently developing consumer applications and expect such applications to be a component of the marketplace in the future. 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
The HCM industry is characterized by continuing improvements in technology, resulting in the frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, changes in client needs, and continual improvement in product performance characteristics. We strive to be cost-effective and timely in enhancing our solutions, developing software that addresses the varied needs of growing businesses and anticipating technological advances while adhering to payroll and HCM industry standards. First-to-market mobile applications are a testament to our success in innovation.
Our development teams work with clients and sales and marketing teams to build solutions based on market requirements and client feedback. We also garner inputs from clients, competitive comparisons, and relevant technology innovations. Development teams are staffed with product owners, solutions architects, software engineers, software engineers in test, quality assurance analysts, technical writers, scrum masters and usability designers.
Our research and development strategies are based on agile methodologies that foster continuous innovation and improvement with collaboration with stakeholders. The development team enhances the functionality of our solutions through new feature releases, with a focus on solutions delivered as SaaS for businesses that struggle with complexity and Reseller Partners that need back-office tools and scalable infrastructure. We continue to evaluate opportunities for developing new solutions that enable organizations to streamline and automate HR tasks associated with growing their businesses. We seek to simultaneously allow organizations to improve their productivity while reducing the costs associated with those tasks.
Asure is particularly focused on developing product capabilities that involve the movement and reconciliation of money. We plan to enhance our Treasury Management software position, which we expect to leverage macro trends in the payroll industry including same-day-pay, pay advances, and employee payments in the currency of their choice – including crypto currencies. We believe these money movement capabilities will also create new product opportunities similar to stored value cards and an “Asure Wallet” which may allow us to hold and invest larger sums of payroll funds for a longer period of time.
We continually work to automate processes using Robotic Process Automation (“RPA”) by developing “bots” that perform repetitive tasks. These bots act as digital workers that make us more efficient and eliminate errors. Most importantly, our RPA initiatives allow us to quickly take advantage of new opportunities and scale the business without the expense or lead times required to hire additional staff.
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
We sell our solutions through both direct and partner models. Prospective clients learn about Asure in a variety of ways, including advertising, website searches, sales calls, public relations, referral channels, direct marketing, and social media. When prospective clients show an interest in Asure, they are connected with a sales representative, who works to close the sale, via Asure’s web site, phone, or a face-to-face meeting by discussing solutions that meet their needs. We track our marketing and sales activities to provide immediate insights into activities, leads and pipeline opportunities. Our account management teams work with clients to promote and sell additional solutions that are relevant for each client. We supplement our direct sales efforts with partner programs. By working with partners, we gain access to opportunities in various geographic and industry niches.
Asure has two distinct partners: Reseller Partners and Referral Partners.
Reseller Partners. Reseller Partners pay us recurring license fees to white label our solutions while providing value-added services to their clients (our indirect clients). There are generally two types of Reseller Partners: regional payroll providers and SMB trusted advisors (CPA, regional banks, and benefit brokers). Regional payroll providers typically focus on a specific geographic area or industry. They have proven to be attractive alternatives for SMBs’ payroll and HCM needs versus national payroll companies that may not cater to the local needs of SMBs. Since trusted advisors are relied on by entrepreneurs and executives at SMBs to advise on payroll and HR decisions, white labeling our solutions allows them to provide additional solutions directly to their clients.
Our Reseller Partners are the primary source of our acquisitions. Because they white label our solutions, technology integration risk is lessened. By acquiring Reseller Partners, we gain a presence in specific geographic (typically less densely populated U.S. metropolitan cities) and industry niches. These acquisitions help Asure gain scale by assuming all of the Reseller Partners’ revenue rather than a recurring licensing fee. Reseller Partners can continue to license our solutions with the opportunity to expand their available solutions, or they can come under the Asure umbrella.
Referral Partners. Referral Partners are typically trusted advisors (e.g., regional banks, CPAs, and benefit brokers) that provide us with SMB leads but do not resell our solutions. Since SMBs rely on their trusted advisors to guide them in selecting payroll and HCM solutions, we have found this to be a fruitful source of leads. Referral Partners provide qualified leads that convert to clients at a higher rate than non-referral leads. We have been successful in nurturing some Referral Partners to become Reseller Partners over time as the referral relationships develop and they become more comfortable in the HCM space.
COMPETITION
The market for HCM solutions is competitive and subject to evolving technology, shifting client needs, and regular introduction of new products and services. Our competitors range from regional payroll companies to large, well-established companies with multiple product offerings.
Competition in the HCM market is primarily based on product and service quality and reputation, scope of service, application offering and price. Price tends to be the most important factor of competition for our small business clients with fewer employees, while the range of features, implementation, and scalability is more important to our clients with larger businesses.
We compete with companies that provide HCM solutions by various means. Many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software, but there is increased competition in the delivery of HCM cloud-based solutions by other SaaS providers. Competitors in the HCM market tend to fluctuate, however, Asure’s main competitors are ADP, Paychex, UKG, Paylocity, Paycor, Paycom, Ceridian, Namely, and Gusto. Primary competitors to Asure Time & Attendance include UKG, Paychex, ADP and Time Simplicity. Primary competitors to our tax management solutions are Ceridian and ADP.
While Asure has the advantage of a flexible, easy to use, cloud-based SaaS-delivered solution that is affordable for SMBs and has a proven deployment methodology, Asure faces several competitive challenges:
•Vendors with face-to-face sales contact. In this highly relationship-based sales process, vendors with large, dispersed field-based sales teams who meet and consult with prospects have an advantage. Vendors that approach the market in this manner include ADP, Paychex, Kronos, and Paylocity.
•National payroll processors with loss-leader products. Large brand and market share payroll processing vendors (such as ADP and Paychex) offer equivalent point solutions at little or no cost to prospects when they sign up for the first few months when in a competitive engagement because the short-term lost revenue is inconsequential compared with the long-term revenue they expect to receive over the next 8 to 10 years with that same client.
Some of our competitors, both current and future, may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us and therefore may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements. As a result, they may compete more effectively on price and other terms. Additionally, those competitors may devote greater resources in developing products or in promoting and selling their products to achieve greater market acceptance. We are actively taking measures designed to address competitive challenges, and clients tend to recognize the benefits of working with an established and publicly traded partner versus a start-up or transitional vendor. However, we cannot ensure that we will be able to achieve or maintain a competitive advantage with respect to any of these competitive factors.
MARKETING
Our marketing strategy relies on a comprehensive integrated plan rooted in our business objectives. Our marketing plan includes four primary objectives: build brand awareness, develop lead generation programs that drive revenue, launch products in a meaningful way, and develop an infrastructure that supports and measures marketing activities.
We deploy direct marketing programs to drive awareness, interest and revenue. Marketing vehicles include our web site, organic and paid search, advertising, public relations, direct marketing, events, social media, content marketing, reputation management, and other digital marketing tactics. Our marketing plan addresses growth and retention goals for key target audiences throughout the United States.
SALES ENABLEMENT
We continue to invest in sales enablement tools, processes, and best-practice training of our sales organization. We have implemented and continue to optimize an end-to-end lead generation process that generates leads from marketing activities and captures and tracks all digital click behavior of the lead in our marketing automation software and customer relation management. We follow up with leads and take all through a qualification process that ends in a closed loop of either won/lost opportunities or leads that get passed back to marketing for further nurturing. Sales Enablement staff support sales with product training, client and prospect demonstrations, and marketing webinars as well as best practices in modern selling that leverages email, social media, and online video.
INDUSTRY REGULATION
Many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain U.S. laws and regulations that apply to them, particularly in their capacity as employers under state and federal laws. Failure to comply with existing laws or regulations or to anticipate and incorporate new laws and regulations into our services to remain compliant could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences.
Data privacy and security of data is subject to strict regulatory oversight. The laws governing the collection, processing, and storage of personal and sensitive data differ between jurisdictions and differ based on the type of data collected. We collect and process the personal and sensitive information of clients, clients of our Reseller Partners, employees of our clients and Reseller Partners, vendors, and our own employees. In general, data that we process and store includes personally identifying information such as names, addresses, social security numbers, bank account information. As part of our time and attendance products, data that we process and store includes biometric data. We are, therefore, subject to certain compliance obligations under federal, state, and foreign privacy and data security-related laws. For instance, in the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, including the related data security provisions, applies to our flexible spending account services. We are also subject to federal and state security, privacy, and security breach notification laws with respect to personal and sensitive data as defined under such laws. Such state and federal laws include laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended and the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act and rules and regulations promulgated under the Federal Trade Commission. Other states, including Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, and Utah, have recently enacted new data privacy laws. The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act became effective in January 2023. The remainder of the new legislation becomes effective mid to late 2023. These new laws track significant portions of existing laws but include differences that may or may not increase our compliance burden. We have a small number of end-user clients located in the European Union using our time and attendance software. Accordingly, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation applies to the collection, processing, and storage of applicable sensitive and personal data. In some instances, these laws provide for civil penalties for violations and private rights of action for data breaches or other violations of the law. Moreover, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on the Company through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability. Failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, or financial condition; or have other adverse consequences.
As part of our payroll and payroll tax solutions, we move funds from clients’ accounts to employees, taxing authorities, and other payees. Over the past few years, a number of state regulators have expanded their interpretation of state money transmission and money service business statutes to include these standard payroll processing activities, necessitating our registering in certain jurisdictions as a money transmitter. We are licensed as a payroll processor in jurisdictions requiring licensure of payroll processors. We pursue licensure as a money transmitter in jurisdictions that require payroll processors to be licensed under state money transmission laws. We are also planning to pursue money transmission licenses in jurisdictions that have not yet made a determination as to whether their money transmitter statutes apply to payroll processors. Money transmission activities may be subject to anti-money laundering laws at the state and federal levels. The applicable laws may include: the anti-money laundering and reporting provisions of The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2000, which apply to money services businesses, and all related laws and regulations, including the requirement to verify customer identification and report suspicious activities to applicable authorities.
Many of our solutions assist clients in complying with certain U.S. laws and regulations that apply to them, particularly in the human resources and employment law areas such as wage payment laws, state payroll tax filing and reporting, employee onboarding, and compliance with the IRS rules governing employers including tax withholdings, payroll tax filing and the preparation of Form W-2. Our HCM solutions assist clients with managing their compliance with other laws, including help to meet their obligations as a plan sponsor under COBRA; sponsor and administer compliant Flexible Spending Account Plans; and provide compliant Consumer Health Care Plans, such as Health Savings Accounts and Health Reimbursement Accounts. Our Tax Management solutions also support bulk filing and processing of Employee Retention Tax credits, which is new legislation that is part of the CARES Act.
