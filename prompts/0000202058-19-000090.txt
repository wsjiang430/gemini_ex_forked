ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.


L3HARRIS
General
We were incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as the successor to three companies founded in the 1890s. Our principal executive offices are located at 1025 West NASA Boulevard, Melbourne, Florida 32919, and our telephone number is (321) 727-9100. As noted above, our common stock is now traded under the ticker symbol “LHX” on the NYSE, and unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Company” and “L3Harris” as used in this Report mean Harris Corporation and its subsidiaries when referring to periods prior to the end of fiscal 2019 (prior to the L3Harris Merger) and to the combined company, L3Harris Technologies, Inc., when referring to periods after the end of fiscal 2019 (after the L3Harris Merger).
During fiscal 2019, we operated as Harris Corporation, a leading technology innovator, solving customers’ toughest mission-critical challenges by providing solutions that connect, inform and protect. We supported government and commercial customers in more than 100 countries, with our largest customers being various departments and agencies of the U.S. Government and their prime contractors. Our products, systems and services had defense and civil government applications, as well as commercial applications. As of the end of fiscal 2019, we had approximately 18,200 employees, including approximately 8,000 engineers and scientists.
As of June 28, 2019, we structured our operations primarily around the products, systems and services we sold and the markets we served, and we reported the financial results of our continuing operations in the following three reportable segments, which were also referred to as our business segments:

• | Communication Systems, serving markets in tactical communications and defense products, including tactical ground and airborne radio communications solutions and night vision technology, and in public safety networks;


• | Electronic Systems, providing electronic warfare, avionics, and command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (“C4ISR”) solutions for defense and classified customers and mission-critical communication systems for civil and military aviation and other customers; and

Subsequent Events
As described in more detail in Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies under “Principles of Consolidation” and Note 26: Subsequent Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report (the “Notes”), the L3Harris Merger closed on June 29, 2019, after Harris’ fiscal 2019 ended (on June 28, 2019), and consequently, all or significant portions of the disclosure in the business description, results of operations, financial position, financial reports and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Report principally relate to Harris.
Through fiscal 2019, our fiscal years ended on the Friday nearest June 30. Commencing June 29, 2019, our fiscal year will end on the Friday nearest December 31, and the period commencing on June 29, 2019 will be a fiscal transition period ending on January 3, 2020 (the “Fiscal Transition Period”). Our segment reporting for the Fiscal Transition Period will be adjusted to reflect our new organizational structure announced July 1, 2019, consisting of the following four business segments: 

• | Integrated Mission Systems, including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (“ISR”); advanced electro optical and infrared solutions; and maritime power and navigation;


• | Space and Airborne Systems, including space payloads, sensors and full-mission solutions; classified intelligence and cyber defense; avionics; and electronic warfare;


• | Communication Systems, including tactical communications; broadband communications; night vision; and public safety; and


• | Aviation Systems, including defense aviation products; security, detection and other commercial aviation products; air traffic management; and commercial and military pilot training.

These changes to our segment reporting are effective as of the beginning of the Fiscal Transition Period and therefore do not affect the historical results, discussion or presentation of our business segments as set forth in this Report. We will report our financial results consistent with this new segment reporting structure beginning with the fiscal quarter ending September 27, 2019.

Additional information regarding funded backlog is provided under “Item 1. Business - Funded Backlog” of this Report. For a discussion of certain risks affecting this segment, including risks relating to our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, see “Item 1. Business - Principal Customers; Government Contracts,” “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report.
New Business Segments Following L3Harris Merger (Effective Starting with Fiscal Transition Period)
As noted above, we completed the L3Harris Merger on June 29, 2019, after Harris’ fiscal 2019 ended (on June 28, 2019). L3 was a prime contractor in ISR systems, aircraft sustainment (including modifications and fleet management of special mission aircraft), simulation and training, night vision and image intensification equipment, and security and detection systems. L3 also was a leading provider of a broad range of communication, electronic and sensor systems used on military, homeland security and commercial platforms. L3 customers included the DoD and its prime contractors, the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), foreign governments and domestic and foreign commercial customers. 
As a result of the L3Harris Merger, L3Harris is an agile global aerospace and defense technology innovator, delivering end-to-end solutions that meet customers’ mission-critical needs. We provide advanced defense and commercial technologies across air, land, sea, space and cyber domains. L3Harris is expected to have approximately $18 billion in annualized revenue for the Fiscal Transition Period and has approximately 50,000 employees, with customers in over 130 countries.

We are adjusting our segment reporting, effective starting with the Fiscal Transition Period, to reflect our new organizational structure announced July 1, 2019 for the combined operating businesses of L3 and Harris following the L3Harris Merger. Our new structure is designed to meet customers’ mission requirements and leverage our broad technical capabilities and consists of the four business segments described below.
Integrated Mission Systems provides complex ISR systems for large military platforms; advanced electro-optical and infrared (“EO/IR”), laser imaging and targeting sensor systems; and electrical and electronic systems and integration for maritime power and navigation solutions for large naval platforms. Integrated Mission Systems principally is comprised of L3 operating businesses, but includes a maritime operating business from Harris’ Electronic Systems segment for fiscal 2019.
Space and Airborne Systems provides space payloads, sensors and full-mission solutions for classified, civil and commercial customers; situational awareness, optical networks and advanced wireless solutions for classified intelligence and cyber defense; avionic sensors, hardened electronics, release systems, data links and antennas supporting fixed wing and rotary platforms; and multi-spectral situational awareness, threat warning and countermeasures capabilities for electronic warfare solutions for airborne and maritime platforms. Space and Airborne Systems is comprised of a mix of L3 and Harris operating businesses, including nearly all of the operating businesses from Harris’ Space and Intelligence Systems segment for fiscal 2019 and Harris’ Electronic Systems segment for fiscal 2019, except (1) the maritime operating business noted above in the description of Integrated Mission Systems and (2) the mission networks ATM operating businesses noted below in the description of Aviation Systems. 
Communication Systems provides tactical radio communications, SATCOM terminals and battlefield management networks for U.S. and international defense customers; broadband secured mobile networked communication equipment and integration; a full suite of helmet and weapon mounted integrated night vision systems for U.S. and international customers (L3’s night vision business); and radios, applications and equipment for critical public safety and professional communications. Communication Systems is comprised of a mix of L3 and Harris operating businesses, including the tactical communications and public safety and professional communications operating businesses from Harris’ Communication Systems segment for fiscal 2019.
Aviation Systems provides defense aviation products such as precision engagement sensors and systems, small UAVs, antennas and arrays, RF amplifiers and microwave electron devices; commercial aviation products such as airport security and detection solutions and airborne avionics products (for example, traffic collision avoidance and flight recorders); mission communications and networking solutions for air traffic management for the FAA and international air national service providers; and commercial and military pilot training and flight and maintenance simulation. Aviation Systems principally is comprised of L3 operating businesses, but includes the mission networks ATM operating business from Harris’ Electronic Systems segment for fiscal 2019.
International Business
Revenue from products and services where the end consumer is located outside the U.S., including foreign military sales through the U.S. Government, in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $1.5 billion (22 percent of our revenue), $1.4 billion (23 percent of our revenue) and $1.5 billion (25 percent of our revenue), respectively. Most of our international sales were derived from our Communication Systems and Electronic Systems segments. Direct export sales are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars, whereas sales from foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary. Financial information regarding our domestic and international operations, including long-lived assets, is contained in Note 24: Business Segments in the Notes and is incorporated herein by reference.
The majority of our historic international marketing activities have been conducted through subsidiaries that operated in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, Canada and Africa. We also have established international marketing organizations and several regional sales offices. For further information regarding our international subsidiaries, see Exhibit 21 of this Report.
Fiscal 2019 international revenue came from a large number of countries, and no single foreign country accounted for more than 5 percent of our total revenue. Some of our exports are paid for by letters of credit, with the balance carried on an open account. Advance payments, progress payments or other similar payments received prior to or upon shipment often cover most of the related costs incurred. Significant foreign government contracts generally require us to provide performance guarantees. In order to remain competitive in international markets, we also sometimes enter into offset agreements or recourse or vendor financing arrangements to facilitate sales to certain customers.
We historically have utilized indirect sales channels, including dealers, distributors and sales representatives, in the marketing and sale of some lines of products and equipment, both domestically and internationally. These independent representatives may buy for resale or, in some cases, solicit orders from commercial or government customers for direct sales by us. Prices to the ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or established by the independent representative and may be above or below our list prices. Our dealers and distributors generally receive a discount from our list prices and may mark up those prices in setting the final sales prices paid by the customer. Revenue from indirect sales channels 
 9

represented approximately 10 percent of total revenue in each of fiscal 2019 and 2018 and 11 percent of total revenue in fiscal 2017. International revenue from indirect sales channels represented approximately 37 percent, 41 percent and 31 percent of total international revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The particular economic, social and political conditions for business conducted outside the U.S. differ from those encountered by businesses in the U.S. We believe that the overall business risk for our international business as a whole is somewhat greater than that faced by our domestic businesses as a whole. A description of the types of risks to which we are subject in our international business is contained in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report. In our opinion, these risks are partially mitigated by the diversification of our international business and the protection provided by letters of credit and advance payments, progress payments and other similar payments.
Competition
We operate in highly competitive markets that are sensitive to technological advances. Many of our competitors in each of our markets are larger than we are and can maintain higher levels of expenditures for research and development. In each of our markets, we concentrate on the opportunities that we believe are compatible with our resources, overall technological capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive factors in these markets are product quality and reliability; technological capabilities, including reliable, resilient and innovative cyber capabilities; service; past performance; ability to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions; ability to meet delivery schedules; the effectiveness of third-party sales channels in international markets; and cost-effectiveness. We frequently “partner” or are involved in subcontracting and teaming relationships with companies that are, from time to time, competitors on other programs. Our principal competitors include BAE Systems, Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Motorola Solutions, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and United Technologies. 
Principal Customers; Government Contracts 
The percentage of our revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 was approximately 77 percent, 75 percent and 74 percent, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2019. Additional information regarding customers for each of our segments is provided under “Item 1. Business — Description of Business by Segment” of this Report. Our U.S. Government sales are predominantly derived from contracts with departments and agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S. Government. Most of the sales in our Electronic Systems and Space and Intelligence Systems segments are made directly or indirectly to the U.S. Government under contracts or subcontracts containing standard government contract clauses providing for redetermination of profits, if applicable, and for termination for the convenience of the U.S. Government or for default based on performance.
Our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts include both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts. Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (“GWACs”) and multi-vendor IDIQ contracts, which can include task orders for each contract type, require us to compete both for the initial contract and then for individual task or delivery orders under such contracts.
Our U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs plus payment of a fee and fall into three basic types: (i) cost-plus fixed-fee contracts, which provide for payment of a fixed fee irrespective of the final cost of performance; (ii) cost-plus incentive-fee contracts, which provide for payment of a fee that may increase or decrease, within specified limits, based on actual results compared with contractual targets relating to factors such as cost, performance and delivery schedule; and (iii) cost-plus award-fee contracts, which provide for payment of an award fee determined at the customer’s discretion based on our performance against pre-established performance criteria. Under our U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed periodically for allowable costs and are paid a portion of the fee based on contract progress. Some overhead costs have been made partially or wholly unallowable for reimbursement by statute or regulation. Examples include certain merger and acquisition costs, lobbying costs, charitable contributions, interest expense and certain litigation defense costs.
Our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts are either firm fixed-price contracts or fixed-price incentive contracts. Under our U.S. Government firm fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work or sell a specific product for a fixed price and, as a result, benefit from cost savings and carry the burden of cost overruns. Under our U.S. Government fixed-price incentive contracts, we share with the U.S. Government both savings accrued for performance at less than target cost as well as costs incurred in excess of target cost up to a negotiated ceiling price, which is higher than the target cost, but carry the entire burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price. Accordingly, under such incentive contracts, profit may also be adjusted up or down depending on whether specified performance objectives are met. Under our U.S. Government firm fixed-price and fixed-price incentive contracts, we generally receive from the U.S. Government either milestone payments totaling 100 percent of the contract price or monthly progress payments in amounts equaling 80 percent of costs incurred under the contract. The remaining amounts, including profits or incentive fees, are billed upon delivery and final acceptance of end items and deliverables under the contract. Our production contracts are mainly fixed-price contracts, and development contracts are generally cost-reimbursable contracts.
 10

As stated above, U.S. Government contracts are terminable for the convenience of the U.S. Government, as well as for default based on performance. Companies supplying goods and services to the U.S. Government are dependent on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds and may be affected by changes in U.S. Government policies resulting from various military, political, economic and international developments. Long-term U.S. Government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if appropriations for subsequent performance periods become unavailable. Under contracts terminable for the convenience of the U.S. Government, a contractor is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and, in general, the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done. Contracts that are terminable for default generally provide that the U.S. Government pays only for the work it has accepted and may require the contractor to pay for the incremental cost of re-procurement and may hold the contractor liable for damages. In many cases, there is also uncertainty relating to the complexity of designs, necessity for design improvements and difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work. Under many U.S. Government contracts, we are required to maintain facility and personnel security clearances complying with DoD and other Federal agency requirements. 
In addition, the U.S. Government recently has increased its focus on procurement process improvement initiatives and has implemented certain changes in its procurement practices. These developments may change the way U.S. Government contracts are solicited, negotiated and managed, which may affect whether and how we pursue opportunities to provide our products and services to the U.S. Government, including the terms and conditions under which we do so, which may have an adverse impact to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, contracts awarded under the DoD’s Other Transaction Authority for research and prototypes generally require cost-sharing and may not follow, or may follow only in part, standard U.S. Government contracting practices and terms, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) and Cost Accounting Standards.
For further discussion of risks relating to U.S. Government contracts, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report.
Backlog
Total Company-wide funded backlog was approximately $5.8 billion and $5.2 billion at the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Company-wide total backlog, including unfunded backlog, was $8.3 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. The determination of backlog involves substantial estimating, particularly with respect to customer requirements contracts and development and production contracts of a cost-reimbursable or incentive nature. The level of order activity related to U.S. Government programs can be affected by timing of U.S. Government funding authorizations and project evaluation cycles. Year-over-year comparisons could, at times, be impacted by these factors, among others.
We define funded backlog as unfilled firm orders for products and services for which funding has been authorized and, in the case of U.S. Government customers, appropriated. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue associated with this backlog within the next twelve months and the substantial majority of the revenue associated with this backlog within the next three years. However, we can give no assurance of such fulfillment or that our funded backlog will become revenue in any particular period, if at all. Backlog is subject to delivery delays and program cancellations, which are beyond our control.
See Note 23: Backlog in the Notes for additional information about total Company-wide backlog. 
Research and Development
Company-sponsored research and development (“R&D”) costs, which include R&D for commercial products and services and independent R&D related to government products and services, as well as concept formulation studies and technology development that occurs on certain bid and proposal efforts, in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were approximately $331 million, $311 million and $310 million, respectively. A portion of our independent R&D costs are allocated among contracts and programs in process under U.S. Government contractual arrangements. Company-sponsored R&D costs not otherwise allocable are charged to expense when incurred. Company-sponsored research is directed to the development of new products and services and to building technological capability in various markets. 
Customer-sponsored R&D costs are incurred pursuant to contractual arrangements, principally U.S. Government-sponsored contracts requiring us to provide a product or service meeting certain defined performance or other specifications (such as designs). This research helps strengthen and broaden our technical capabilities. Customer-sponsored research costs are accounted for principally by the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method and included in our revenue and cost of product sales and services. 
Patents and Other Intellectual Property
We consider our patents and other intellectual property, in the aggregate, to constitute an important asset. We own a large portfolio of patents, trade secrets, know-how, confidential information, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property, including reliable, resilient and innovative cyber capabilities, and we routinely apply for new patents, trademarks and copyrights. We also license intellectual property to and from third parties. As of June 28, 2019, we held approximately 1,770
 11

U.S. patents and 1,600 foreign patents, and had approximately 160 U.S. patent applications pending and 210 foreign patent applications pending. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills also make an important contribution to our business. Although our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to our business and the operations of our business segments, we do not consider our business or any business segment to be materially dependent on any single patent, license or other intellectual property right, or any group of related patents, licenses or other intellectual property rights. We are engaged in a proactive patent licensing program and have entered into a number of licenses and cross-license agreements, some of which generate royalty income. Although existing license agreements have generated income in past years and may do so in the future, there can be no assurances we will enter into additional income-producing license agreements. From time to time we engage in litigation to protect our patents and other intellectual property. Any of our patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide competitive advantages. For further discussion of risks relating to intellectual property, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report. With regard to certain patents, the U.S. Government has an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license, pursuant to which the U.S. Government may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents. Pursuant to similar arrangements, the U.S. Government may consent to our use of inventions covered by patents owned by other persons. Numerous trademarks used on or in connection with our products are also considered to be a valuable asset.
Environmental and Other Regulations
Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, particularly with regard to waste and emissions. The applicable environmental laws and regulations are common within the industries and markets in which we operate and serve. We believe that we have complied with these requirements and that such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We have installed waste treatment facilities and pollution control equipment to satisfy legal requirements and to achieve our waste minimization and prevention goals. A portion of our environmental expenditures relates to businesses or operations we no longer own, but for which we have retained certain environmental liabilities. We did not spend material amounts on environmental-related capital projects in fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017. Based on currently available information, we do not expect capital expenditures in the Fiscal Transition Period or over the next several years to protect the environment and to comply with current environmental laws and regulations, as well as to comply with current and pending climate control legislation, regulation, treaties and accords, to be material or to have a material impact on our competitive position or financial condition, but we can give no assurance that such expenditures will not exceed current expectations, and such expenditures may increase in future years. If future treaties, laws and regulations contain more stringent requirements than presently anticipated, actual expenditures may be higher than our present estimates of those expenditures. 
Additional information regarding environmental and regulatory matters is set forth in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report and in Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies and Note 25: Legal Proceedings and Contingencies in the Notes.
Electronic products are subject to governmental environmental regulation in a number of jurisdictions, such as domestic and international requirements requiring end-of-life management and/or restricting materials in products delivered to customers, including the European Union’s Directive 2012/19/EU on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment and Directive 2011/65/EU on the Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”), as amended. Other jurisdictions have adopted similar legislation. Such requirements typically are not applicable to most equipment produced by our segments. We believe that we have complied with such rules and regulations, where applicable, with respect to our existing products sold into such jurisdictions. We intend to comply with such rules and regulations with respect to our future products.
Wireless communications, whether radio, satellite or telecommunications, are also subject to governmental regulation. Equipment produced in our Communication Systems segment, in particular, is subject to domestic and international requirements to avoid interference among users of radio and television frequencies and to permit interconnection of telecommunications equipment. We are also required to comply with technical operating and licensing requirements that pertain to our wireless licenses and operations. We believe that we have complied with such rules and regulations and licenses with respect to our existing products and services, and we intend to comply with such rules and regulations and licenses with respect to our future products and services. Governmental reallocation of the frequency spectrum also could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Raw Materials and Supplies
Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our facilities, we use numerous sources for the wide array of raw materials, such as electronic components, printed circuit boards, metals and plastics, needed for our operations and for our products. We are dependent on suppliers and subcontractors for a large number of components and subsystems and the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to adhere to customer or regulatory materials restrictions and to meet performance and quality specifications and delivery schedules. In some instances, we are dependent on one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature of a particular item or because of local content preference 
 12

requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project. Although we have been affected by financial and performance issues of some of our suppliers and subcontractors, we have not been materially adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw materials or products. On occasion, we have experienced component shortages from vendors as a result of natural disasters, or the RoHS environmental regulations in the European Union or similar regulations in other jurisdictions. These events or regulations may cause a spike in demand for certain electronic components, such as lead-free components, resulting in industry-wide supply chain shortages. As of June 28, 2019, these component shortages have not had a material adverse effect on our business. For further discussion of risks relating to subcontractors and suppliers, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report.
Seasonality
We do not consider any material portion of our business to be seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of contract awards and the timing and availability of U.S.  Government funding, as well as the timing of product deliveries and customer acceptance.
Employees
We had approximately 18,200 employees at the end of fiscal 2019. Approximately 95 percent of our employees as of the end of fiscal 2019 were located in the U.S. A significant number of our employees possess a U.S. Government security clearance. We also utilize a number of independent contractors. As of the end of fiscal 2019, approximately 630 of our U.S. employees were working under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions and worker representatives. These collective bargaining agreements will be renegotiated at various times over the next three years as they expire. We have historically renegotiated these agreements without significant disruption to operating activities. Following the L3Harris Merger, we now have more employees working under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions and worker representatives. For certain international subsidiaries, our employees are represented by workers’ councils or statutory labor unions. In general, we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
