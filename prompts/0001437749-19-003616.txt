--------+---------

 
Stock Yards Bancorp, Inc. (“Bancorp” or “Company”), headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is the holding company for Stock Yards Bank & Trust Company (“Bank”). Bancorp, which was incorporated in 1988 in Kentucky, is registered with, and subject to supervision, regulation and examination by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Bank is wholly owned and is a state chartered bank. Because Bancorp has no significant operations of its own, its business and that of the Bank are essentially the same. The operations of the Bank are fully reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Bancorp.  Accordingly, references to “Bancorp” in this document may encompass both the holding company and the Bank.
 
Stock Yards Bank & Trust Company
 
Stock Yards Bank & Trust Company is the banking and sole subsidiary of Bancorp and was chartered in 1904.  The Bank is headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky and provides commercial and personal banking services in the Louisville, Kentucky, Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio metropolitan markets through 38 full service banking offices.  The Bank is chartered under the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  In addition to traditional commercial and personal banking activities, the Bank has a wealth management and trust department (“WM&T”) offering a wide range of investment management, trust, employee benefit plan, estate administration, and financial planning services.   The Bank also originates and sells single-family residential mortgages. Additionally, the Bank offers securities brokerage services via its branch network through an arrangement with a third party broker-dealer. 
 
At December 31, 2018, Stock Yards Bank & Trust Company had 591 full-time equivalent employees. Employees of Stock Yards Bank & Trust Company are entitled to participate in a variety of employee benefit programs including a combined employee profit sharing and stock ownership plan (“KSOP”). Management of Bancorp strives to be an employer of choice and considers the relationship with employees to be good.
 
Supervision and Regulation
 
Bank holding companies and commercial banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state laws. Changes in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on the business and prospects of Bancorp.
 
Bancorp, as a registered bank holding company, is subject to the supervision of and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. In addition, Bancorp is subject to the provisions of Kentucky’s banking laws regulating bank acquisitions and certain activities of controlling bank shareholders.
 
Kentucky and federal banking statutes delineate permissible activities for Kentucky state-chartered banks. Kentucky’s statutes, however, contain a super parity provision for Kentucky chartered banks having one of the top two ratings in its most recent regulatory examination. This provision allows these state banks to engage in any banking activity in which a national bank, a state bank operating in any other state, or a federally chartered thrift could engage. The bank must first obtain a legal opinion specifying the statutory or regulatory provisions that permit the activity.
 
The Bank is subject to the supervision of the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insures the deposits of the Bank to the current maximum of $250,000 per depositor.
 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the “GLB Act”) allows for affiliations among banks, securities firms and insurance companies by means of a financial holding company (“FHC”). The GLB Act requires that, at the time of establishment of an FHC, all depository institutions within that corporate group must be “well managed” and “well capitalized” and must have received a rating of “satisfactory” or better under its most recent Community Reinvestment Act examination. Further, non-banking financial firms (for example an insurance company or securities firm) may establish a FHC and acquire a depository institution. While the distinction between banks and non-banking financial firms has been blurring over recent years, the GLB Act makes it less cumbersome for banks to offer services “financial in nature” but beyond traditional commercial banking activities. Likewise, non-banking financial firms may find it easier to offer services that had, heretofore, been provided primarily by depository institutions.  In 2012, management of Bancorp elected to become and became a FHC.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law in 2010. Generally, the Dodd-Frank Act was effective the day after it was signed into law, but different effective dates apply to specific sections of the law. This extensive and complex legislation contained many provisions affecting the banking industry, including but not limited to:
 

● | Creation of a Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection overseeing banks with assets totaling $10 billion or greater while writing and maintaining several regulations that apply to all banks,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Determination of debit card interchange rates by the Federal Reserve Board,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New regulation over derivative instruments,
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Phase outs of certain forms of trust preferred debt and hybrids previously included as bank capital, and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increases to FDIC deposit coverage, revised calculations for assessing bank premiums, and numerous other provisions affecting financial institution regulation, oversight of certain non-banking organizations, investor protection.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”) requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA, and banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering approval of certain applications. An unsatisfactory CRA rating could, among other things, result in the denial or delay of corporate applications filed by Bancorp or the Bank for proposed activities such as branch openings or relocations and applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or holding company.
 
The federal banking regulators have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is conveyed to outside vendors. The Bank is also subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. These guidelines describe the federal banking agencies’ expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, which would include administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities.
 
The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA Patriot Act. These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specified financial transactions and accounts and other relationships intended to guard against money laundering and terrorism financing. Financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and report certain types of suspicious transactions. Regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these obligations, and failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.
 
In 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved rules that substantially amended regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to Bancorp and Bank. The rules implemented regulatory capital reforms of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision reflected in “Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems” (“Basel III”) and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III regulatory capital reforms became effective for Bancorp and Bank on January 1, 2015, and included new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios. Minimum capital level requirements applicable to bank holding companies and banks subject to the rules are:
 

● | a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%,
--+----------------------------------------------


● | a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%),
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from previous rules), and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions.
--+----------------------------------------------------

The rules also established a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5%, to be phased in over three years between 2016 and 2019, above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios, and will result in the following minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in:
 

● | a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0%,
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%.
--+-------------------------------------------

 
The capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if capital levels fall below minimum levels plus the capital conservation buffer amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.
 
Under these rules, Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, limited amounts of minority interest in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, and non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, subject to certain eligibility standards, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions. The definition of Tier 2 capital is generally unchanged for most banking organizations, subject to certain new eligibility criteria.
 
Common equity Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings plus limited amounts of minority interest in the form of common stock, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions.
 
The rules allowed banks and their holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets a one-time opportunity to opt-out of a requirement to include unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in their capital calculation. Bancorp elected to opt-out of this requirement.
 
As of December 31, 2018, Bancorp met the requirements to be considered well-capitalized and is not subject to limitations due to the capital conservation buffer.
