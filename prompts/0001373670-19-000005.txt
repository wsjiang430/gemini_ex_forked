ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Green Brick Partners, Inc. (formerly named BioFuel Energy Corp.) and its subsidiaries (together, the “Company”, “Green Brick”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a diversified homebuilding and land development company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 11, 2006. 
We acquire and develop land, provide land and construction financing to our controlled builders and participate in the profits of our builders. Our core markets are in the high growth U.S. metropolitan areas of Dallas, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia, as well as the Vero Beach, Florida area. We also own a noncontrolling interest in a builder in Colorado Springs, Colorado. We are engaged in all aspects of the homebuilding process, including land acquisition and development, entitlements, design, construction, title and mortgage services, marketing and sales and the creation of brand images at our residential neighborhoods and master planned communities. 
We believe we offer higher quality homes with more distinctive designs and floor plans than those built by our competitors at comparable prices. Our communities are located in premium locations and we seek to enhance homebuyer satisfaction by utilizing high-quality materials, offering a broad range of customization options and building well-crafted homes. We seek to maximize value over the long term and operate our business to mitigate risks in the event of a downturn by controlling costs and quickly reacting to regional and local market trends.
We are a leading lot developer in our markets and believe that our strict operating discipline provides us with a competitive advantage in seeking to maximize returns while minimizing risk. We currently own or control approximately 8,100 home sites in high-growth submarkets throughout the Dallas and Atlanta metropolitan areas and the Vero Beach, Florida market. We are strategically positioned to either build new homes on our lots through our controlled builders or to sell finished lots to third-party homebuilders. We sell finished lots to our controlled builders or option lots from third-party developers for our controlled builders’ homebuilding operations and provide them with construction financing and strategic planning. Our controlled builders provide us with their local knowledge and relationships. 
We support the majority of our Dallas and Atlanta builders by financing their purchases of land from us at an unlevered internal rate of return (“IRR”) of typically 20% or more and by providing construction financing at an interest rate of at least 13.8%. Our income is further enhanced by our equity interest in the profits of our builders. 
In March 2018, the Company formed a joint venture with a title company in Georgia to provide closing and settlement services to our Atlanta-based builder. The Company, through its Atlanta-based builder, owns a 49% equity interest in Providence Group Title, LLC (“Providence Title”). 
In April 2018, the Company acquired an 80% interest in GRBK GHO Homes, LLC (“GRBK GHO”). GRBK GHO operates primarily in the Vero Beach, Florida market and is engaged in land and lot development, as well as all aspects of the homebuilding process. The acquisition allowed the Company to expand its operations into a new geographic market. 
In June 2018, the Company formed a joint venture, Green Brick Mortgage, LLC (“Green Brick Mortgage”), with PrimeLending to provide mortgage loan origination services to our builders. The Company owns a 49% equity interest in Green Brick Mortgage, which initiated mortgage loan origination activities in September 2018.
In September 2018, the Company formed Trophy Signature Homes, LLC (“Trophy”), a wholly-owned homebuilding company that allows the Company to expand its business and offer homes at a new price point within the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex market. Trophy will begin home sales in the first half of 2019.

Business Strategy
We believe we are well-positioned for growth through the disciplined execution of the following elements of our strategy: 
Combine Land Acquisition and Development Expertise with Homebuilding Operations to Maximize Profitability
Our ability to identify, acquire and develop land in desirable locations and on favorable terms is critical to our success. We evaluate land opportunities based on how we expect such opportunities will contribute to overall profitability and returns, rather than how they might drive volume on a market basis. We identify attractive properties that are typically located in prime neighborhood locations. We consider the existing and future supply of developable land before working to acquire the best-valued properties. Analysis includes consideration of development costs in addition to land costs. We have found that the prime quality infill locations have limited supply competition that may result in smaller value declines in down markets. We manage and oversee all land development with our in-house staff.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

We believe our expertise in land development and planning enables us to create desirable communities that meet or exceed our target homebuyer’s expectations, while selling homes at competitive prices. Our strategy of holding land inventory provides us with a multi-year supply of lots for future homebuilding while limiting any excess supply that would otherwise be subject to market cycle risk. We focus on the development of entitled parcels in communities where we can generally sell all lots and homes within 24 to 60 months from the start of sales. This focus allows us to limit exposure to land development and market cycle risk while pursuing favorable returns on our investments. We seek to minimize our exposure to land risk through disciplined management of entitlements, the use of land and lot options and other flexible land acquisition arrangements.
Maximize Benefits of Diversified Homebuilding and Land Development Structure
Our diversified homebuilding and land development structure provides the flexibility to monetize the value of our land assets either by building and selling homes through our controlled builders or developing land and selling finished lots to unaffiliated homebuilders. When evaluating our land assets, we consider the potential contribution of each asset to our overall performance, taking into account the timeframe over which we may monetize the asset. While we currently expect the majority of our land to be utilized by our controlled homebuilders, we believe our land development and homebuilding strategy provides us with increased flexibility to seek to maximize risk-adjusted returns as market conditions warrant.
Increase Long-Term Value by Investing in Infrastructure
In our communities, we typically make enhanced investment in infrastructure, including landscaping and amenity centers, and enforce higher construction standards through our controlled builders. We believe this creates greater long-term value for us and for our controlled builders, homebuyers, shareholders and the communities in which we build.
Drive Revenue by Opening New Communities from Existing Land Supply
We have strategically invested in new land in a number of prime neighborhoods in our core markets. We currently own or control approximately 8,100 home sites in the Dallas, Atlanta and Vero Beach markets. We expect these land purchases to provide us with the opportunity for continued revenue growth and strong gross margin performance. We continue to identify development opportunities that should allow us to profit from lot sales, construction interest and our equity interest in the profits of our controlled builders.
Increase Market Positions in Dallas and Atlanta
We believe that there are significant opportunities to profitably expand in our core Dallas and Atlanta markets. We continually review the allocation of our investments in these markets taking into account demographic trends and the likely impact on our operating results. We use the results of these reviews to reallocate our investments to those areas where we believe we can maximize our profitability and return on capital. We seek to use our local relationships with land sellers, brokers and investors to pursue the purchase of additional land parcels in our core markets. While our primary growth strategy focuses on increasing our market position in our existing markets, we may, on an opportunistic basis, explore expansion into attractive new markets.
Superior Design, Broad Product Range and Enhanced Homebuying Experience
Within each of our markets, we partner our expertise with our builders to design attractive neighborhoods and homes to appeal to a wide variety of potential homebuyers. One of our core operating philosophies is to create a culture which provides a positive, memorable experience for our homebuyers through active engagement in the building process. At higher price points, we provide our homebuyers with customization options to suit their specific needs and tastes. In consultation with nationally and locally recognized architecture firms, interior and exterior consultants and homeowner focus groups, we research and design a diversified range of products for various levels and price points. Our homebuilding projects include townhomes, patio homes, single family homes and luxury custom homes. We believe we can adapt quickly to changing market conditions and optimize performance and returns while strategically reducing portfolio risk because of our diversified product strategy. 
Pursue Further Growth Through the Prudent Use of Leverage
As of December 31, 2018, our debt to total capitalization ratio was 30%. It is our intent to prudently employ leverage to continue to invest in our land acquisition, development and homebuilding businesses. We target a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 30% to 35%, which we expect will provide us with significant additional growth capital.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Pursue Acquisitions of Additional Homebuilders
We intend to pursue the acquisition of additional homebuilders in our core and new markets. Our preference is to continue to acquire controlling interests in homebuilders with existing management continuing to own a significant ownership stake. We will seek to acquire and then retain management teams which have strong local relationships with land owners and have a positive reputation for building well-crafted homes in their markets. We expect that our ability to provide capital discipline and strategic oversight will complement the local skills, relationships and reputations of our future homebuilder partners.
Marketing and Sales Process
We offer a preferred lender referral program through our mortgage subsidiary to provide lending options to homebuyers in need of financing. We offer homeowners a comprehensive warranty on each home. Homes are generally covered by a ten-year warranty for structural concerns, one year for defects and products used, two years for electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning parts and labor. 
We sell our homes through our internal sales representatives and also through independent real estate brokers. Our in-house sales force typically works from sales offices located in model homes near or in each community. Sales representatives assist potential buyers by providing them with basic floor plans, price information, development and construction timetables, tours of model homes, and the selection of customization and upgrade options. Sales personnel are trained by us and generally have had prior experience selling new homes in the local market. Our personnel, along with subcontracted marketing and design consultants, carefully design the exterior and interior of each home to appeal to the lifestyles of targeted homebuyers. Additionally, we advertise through the use of model homes, social media, newspapers, billboards, real estate market publications, brochures, and newsletters.
Raw Materials
Typically, all the raw materials and most of the components used in our business are readily available in the United States. Most are standard items carried by major suppliers. However, a rapid increase in the number of homes started could cause shortages in the availability of such materials or in the price of services, thereby leading to delays in the delivery of homes. We continue to monitor the supply markets to achieve the best prices available. See “Risk Factors - Labor and raw material shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of land development and home construction, which could materially and adversely affect our business.”
Seasonality
The homebuilding industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in spring and summer, although this activity is also highly dependent on the number of active selling communities, timing of new community openings and other market factors. Since it typically takes five to nine months to construct a new home, we deliver more homes in the second half of the year as spring and summer home orders are delivered. Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the second and third quarters, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occur during the third and fourth quarters. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry.
Competition
Competition in the homebuilding industry is intense, and there are relatively low barriers to entry. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, homebuyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. Increased competition could hurt our business, as it could prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion, and lead to pricing pressures on our homes that may adversely impact our revenues and margins. If we are unable to successfully compete, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our competitors may independently develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products. Furthermore, a number of our primary competitors are significantly larger, have a longer operating history and may have greater resources or lower cost of capital; accordingly, they may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which we operate. Many of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which we operate. We also compete for sales with individual resales of existing homes and with available rental housing.

Our Competitive Strengths
Our business is characterized by the following competitive strengths:
Optionality Provided by Our Combined Land Development and Homebuilding Structure
We are strategically positioned to either build and sell new homes on lots through our controlled builders or develop land and sell finished lots to unaffiliated homebuilders. While our business plan has increasingly focused on building new homes on our owned and controlled lots, we proactively monitor market conditions to opportunistically sell a minority of our finished lots to unaffiliated homebuilders if we believe that doing so will maximize our returns or lower our risk.
Experienced Management Team
Our founder and Chief Executive Officer, James R. Brickman, has over 40 years of experience in real estate development and home building. Richard A. Costello, our Chief Financial Officer, joined the Company in 2015 and provides oversight of lending relationships, cash management, and investor relations. Mr. Costello has over 25 years of financial and operational experience in all aspects of real estate management. Jed Dolson, President of Texas Region, joined the Company in 2013 and is responsible for land entitlement and development activities in Dallas, as well as oversight of our Dallas homebuilding operations. Summer Loveland, our Chief Accounting Officer, joined the Company in 2017 and is responsible for the oversight of financial reporting, internal audit, treasury functions, and information technology. We believe that our experienced management team is well positioned to design and execute the development of complex, master planned residential communities.
Focus on Operations in Housing Markets with a Favorable Growth Outlook and Strong Demand Fundamentals
We believe our core markets exhibit attractive residential real estate investment characteristics, such as growing economies, improving levels of employment and population growth relative to national averages, favorable migration patterns, general housing affordability, and desirable lifestyle and weather characteristics.
We believe that increasing demand and supply constraints in our core markets create favorable conditions for our future growth. 
Attractive Land Positions in Our Core Markets
We believe that we have strategically well-located land and lot positions within our core markets. We believe we have acquired our land and lot positions at attractive prices, providing us with significant opportunity for a healthy return on our investment. 
In Dallas and Atlanta, we seek to acquire land with convenient access to metropolitan areas which have diverse economic and employment bases and demographics that we believe will support long-term growth. 
Land Sourcing and Evaluation Capabilities
We believe that the experience and strong reputation of our management team, combined with our long-standing relationships with other market participants, provide us with a competitive advantage in efficiently sourcing, purchasing and entitling land. We are actively involved in every step of the land entitlement, home design and construction processes with our controlled builders. Our management team has developed significant collaborative relationships over decades with land sellers, developers, contractors, lenders, brokers and investors. Our deep and wide-ranging knowledge of our markets and our ability to quickly and efficiently identify, acquire and develop land in desirable locations and on favorable terms are key to our success.
Disciplined Investment Approach
We seek to maximize value over the long-term and operate our business to mitigate risks in the event of a downturn by controlling costs and focusing on regional and local market trends.
Our management team has gained significant operating expertise through varied economic cycles. The perspective gained from these experiences has helped shape our investment approach. We believe that our management team has learned to effectively evaluate housing trends in our markets, and to react quickly and rationally to market changes. Our cycle-tested management approach balances strategic planning with day-to-day decision-making responsibilities, freeing up our controlled

builders to concentrate on growing our homebuilding business rather than focusing on obtaining capital to fund their operations. We believe that our strict operating discipline provides us with a competitive advantage in seeking to maximize returns while minimizing risk.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our developments are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements, the result of which is to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development and service fees for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development.
We are also subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary according to multiple factors, including the site’s location, its environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site, as well as adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding and land development activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. In addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the restriction or elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. From time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and similar federal or state agencies review homebuilders’ compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to comply strictly with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken may increase our costs. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on homebuilders and land developers in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber.
Under various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for related damages, including bodily injury, and investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. Please see “Risk Factors” located in Part I, Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 390 employees, including those of our controlled builders. Although none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, certain of the subcontractors engaged by us or our affiliates are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining arrangements. We believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are favorable.
