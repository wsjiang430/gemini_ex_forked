Corporate History
 
The Company was incorporated as Minaro Corp. under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 14, 2017. Minaro has only one officer and director who is Yulia Lazaridou. We are engaged in business of 3D design and we intend to provide 3D rendering, animation and architectural visualization services to architects, builders, advertising agencies, interior designers and related.
 
On March 14, 2017, the Company issued 2,800,000 shares of restricted common stock to Yulia Lazaridou. The value of these shares is $2,800 based on the par value of $0.001 per share of common stock.
 
On October 2, 2017, we consummated an agreement with Hewlett Packard Co., Ltd, for the purchase of equipment to be used in our 3D rendering. It says that Hewlett Packard Co., Ltd. is our supplier from which we should receive the following Goods: Laptop, UHD Monitor, Capture Pen and Touch Tablet, AutoCAD, Adobe Photoshop and other equipment and software to start our business. The Hewlett Packard Co., Ltd. should sell, transfer and deliver the Goods to Minaro Corp. The sum should be in USD currency. We have to make payment by wire transfer for the Goods at the terms specified in the invoice but not less than 50% of the invoice amount to Hewlett Packard Co., Ltd. The Goods should be deemed received by Minaro Corp. (with registration Kleonos 8A, Lakatameia, 2333, Cyprus) when delivered to our Company current rented office space at 39 Markou Mpotsari, Kaimakli, 1037 Nicosia, Cyprus.
 
About 3D design with visualization 
 
The term 3D visualization is used synonymously with 3D graphics, 3D rendering, computer generated imagery (CGI), and other terms. They all basically refer to the process by which graphical content is created using 3D software. Its a technology that has become mainstream over the last few decades and has evolved into one of the most viable options for producing high- quality digital content. Three-dimensional rendering and 3D modeling is accomplished by taking two-dimensional forms and giving them volume. Created with specialized software, the computer-generated images are wide used in architecture.
 
Minaro Corp. produces 3D visualizations (3D exterior for commercial space and interior renderings, prototyping, 3D modeling). We are the startup in this area, but we believe we can reach the highest level- to enter the international level and become a part of 3D developers of a global scale. Minaro Corp. is going to provide our clients with the high quality products, visualizing their thoughts and ideas.
 
During the work process we would like keeping our clients up to date on our progress, so they can follow us and know in advance what the finished product will look like.
 
Minaro Corp. is fast, affordable and our main goal is to make each client being pleased with the result and willing to develop a long-term cooperation. Minaro Corp. operates in a highly collaborative manner with each client utilizing their knowledge and talents to achieve a total client satisfaction.
 
Our goal at the beginning of each new project is to reach the highest level of our client vision understanding to transform it into stunning 3D design visualization.

Operational Plan
 
Minaro is a start-up stage company incorporated in Nevada engaged in providing 3D design service for commercial spaces. Minaro is committed to the providing service in Cyprus. Rather than focus on providing 3D design service in one market, Minaro intends to pursue providing 3D design with visualization and organization of commercial space in the global marketplace through internal growth, industry leading development of high quality service, marketing.
 
Minaro plans to become a rapidly growing specialty designer who will offer the service of 3D design for commercial spaces produced and designed by us. Our service will include, but will not strictly be limited to, produces 3D visualizations that include 3D exterior for commercial space and interior renderings, prototyping, 3D modeling and other 3D design related merchandise. We intend to expand and develop our business throughout Cyprus and internationally, into a well-recognized and respected company. Currently, we have active agreements with ASBILI and Twidel Co., to provision of service to the client for a period of one year. 
 
Our current plan is to provide 3D design service in the minimum quantity ordered per our existing agreement with ASBILI.
 
Equipment and raw materials 
 
The Company has in use a Laptop Intel Core i7. In the work Minaro Corp. going to use the program such AutoCAD (commercial computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting software application), SketchUp (3D modeling computer program for a wide range of drawing applications such as architectural, interior design, landscape architecture, civil and mechanical engineering), Adobe Photoshop (raster graphics editor), Autodesk 3ds Max (professional 3D computer graphics program for making 3D animations, models) and Revit (building information modeling software for architects, structural engineers, MEP engineers, designers and contractors). This programs are important for our service, as they have excellent speed and accuracy, optimal set of functions, easy to use, good value for money, proven as reliable programs and can perform a variety of tasks.

Order Execution Process
 
Our order execution process in general can be described as below:
 
The most important stage is to be known about the:
 1. Measurement (size of the room), 
 2. The tasks (what will be built, under whom, for how many people)
 3. Concept development (future plan / planning decision)
 4. Sketches (3D model in sketchpad for example)
 5. Visualizations
 6. Drawings (technical documentation)
 
5
 
The process of 3d architectural visualization begins with the collection of all the documents necessary for the project such as AutoCAD drawings and photographs of the project, videos, images, reference materials, target audience and expected objectives. Once the documents are collected they are being reviewed and analyzed to evolve the right action plan to assure the best output. The texture (for a more realistic look) and appropriate lighting (for the enhancement of the layout with landscape) are the last touches applied to the shorts prior to 3D rendering.

Webpage and Marketing 
 
We plan to market our services in Cyprus. Architectural visualization services we plan on providing are highly dependent on construction industry in Cyprus. 
 
Initially, our services will be promoted by our President, Yulia Lazaridou. She will discuss our product with her friends and business associates. The marketing and advertising will be targeted to architects, builders, advertising agencies, interior designers and various sectors which have need of 3D visualization in Cyprus. We intend to develop and maintain a database of potential clients who may want to use Minaros services. We will follow up with these clients periodically and offer them free presentations and special discounts from time to time. Our methods of communication will include: phone calls and emails. We will ask our satisfied clients for referrals.
 
We will market and advertise our product on our web site (www.minaro-corp.com) by showing its advantages over visualization services offered by other companies. We intend to attract traffic to our website by a variety of online marketing tactics such as registering with top search engines using selected key words (meta tags) and utilizing link and banner exchange options.  We intend to promote our website by displaying it on our promotion materials.
 
We plan to expand our services to USA market in the future only when or if we have the available resources and growth to warrant it. Currently this option is questionable.  
 
We intend to continue our marketing efforts during the life of our operations. We intend to spend from $500 to $8,000 on marketing efforts during the first year. There is no guarantee that we will be able to attract or retain enough customers to justify our expenditures.

Competitors 
 
There are many well-established 3D design companies that provide service in our area like K3d Architectural 3d & Graphic Art, SPOON Ltd., Changa Vision, Bizzy Bee Media et.  Most of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and will be able to withstand sales or price decreases better than we can. We also expect to continue to face competition from new market service entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
