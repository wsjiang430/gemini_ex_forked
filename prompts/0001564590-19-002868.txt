ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General
 Paramount Group, Inc. is a fully-integrated REIT focused on owning, operating, managing, acquiring and redeveloping high-quality, Class A office properties in select central business district submarkets of New York City, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. All references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Paramount” refer to Paramount Group, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Paramount Group Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership. We conduct our business through, and substantially all our interests in properties and investments are held by, the Operating Partnership. We are the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 90.3% of the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of 12 Class A office properties aggregating approximately 11.9 million square feet that was 97.0% leased and 95.1% occupied. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
 
We believe that we distinguish ourselves from other owners and operators of office properties through the following competitive strengths: 
 
 
• | Premier Portfolio of High-Quality Office Properties in the Most Desirable Submarkets. We have assembled a premier portfolio of Class A office properties located exclusively in carefully selected submarkets of New York City, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. Our submarkets are among the strongest commercial real estate submarkets in the United States for office properties due to a combination of their high barriers to entry, constrained supply, strong economic characteristics and a deep pool of prospective tenants in various industries that have demonstrated a strong demand for high-quality office space. Our markets are international business centers, characterized by a broad tenant base with a highly educated workforce, a mature and functional transportation infrastructure and an overall amenity rich environment. These markets are home to a diverse range of large and growing enterprises in a variety of industries, including financial services, media and entertainment, consulting, legal and other professional services, technology, as well as federal government agencies. As a result of the above factors, the submarkets in which we are invested have generally outperformed the broader markets in which they are located.

• | Demonstrated Acquisition and Operational Expertise. Over the past 21 years, we have developed and refined our highly successful real estate investment strategy. We have a proven reputation as a value-enhancing, hands-on operator of Class A office properties. We target opportunities with a value-add component, where we can leverage our operating expertise, deep tenant relationships, and proactive approach to asset and property management. In certain instances, we may acquire properties with existing or expected future vacancy or with significant value embedded in existing below-market leases, which we will be able to mark-to-market over time. Even fully leased properties from time to time present us with value-enhancing opportunities which we have been able to capitalize on in the past.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Value-Add Renovation and Repositioning and Development Capabilities. We have expertise in renovating, repositioning and developing office properties. We have historically acquired well-located assets that have either suffered from a need for physical improvement to upgrade the property to Class A space, have been underperforming due to a lack of a coherent leasing and branding strategy or have been under-managed and could be immediately enhanced by our hands-on approach. We are experienced in upgrading, renovating and modernizing building lobbies, corridors, bathrooms, elevator cabs and base building systems and updating antiquated spaces to include new ceilings, lighting and other amenities. We have also successfully aggregated and are continuing to combine smaller spaces to offer larger blocks of space, including multiple floors, which are attractive to larger, high credit-quality tenants. We believe that the post-renovation quality of our buildings and our hands-on asset and property management approach attract high credit-quality tenants and allow us to increase our cash flow.

• | Deep Relationships with Diverse, High Credit-Quality Tenant Base. We have long-standing relationships with high-quality tenants, including Allianz Global Investors, LP, Barclays Capital, Inc., Clifford Chance LLP, Morgan Stanley, Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank, Norton Rose Fulbright, Showtime Networks Inc., TD Bank, N.A., Warner Music Group, Google Inc. and First Republic Bank.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Strong Internal Growth Prospects. We have substantial embedded rent growth within our portfolio as a result of the strong historical and projected future rental rate growth within our submarkets, contractual fixed rental rate increases included in our leases and incremental rent from the lease-up of vacant and expiring leases in our portfolio.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conservative Balance Sheet. Over the past several decades, we have built strong relationships with numerous lenders, investors and other capital providers. Our financing track record and depth of relationships provide us with significant financial flexibility and capacity to fund future growth in both good and bad economic environments. We have a strong capital structure that supports this flexibility and growth. As of December 31, 2018, our share of net debt to enterprise value was 46.2% and we had $339.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proven Investment Management Business. We have a successful investment management business, where we serve as the general partner and property manager of certain private equity real estate funds for institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals. We have also entered into a number of joint ventures with institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals and other sophisticated real estate investors through which we and our funds have invested in real estate properties. We expect our investment management business to be a complementary part of our overall real estate investment business.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seasoned and Committed Management Team with Proven Track Record. Our senior management team, led by Albert Behler, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, has been in the commercial real estate industry for an average of 22 years, and has worked at our company for an average of 12 years. Our senior management team is highly regarded in the real estate community and has extensive relationships with a broad range of brokers, owners, tenants and lenders. We have developed relationships that enable us to secure high credit-quality tenants on attractive terms and provide us with potential off-market acquisition opportunities. We believe that our proven acquisition and operating expertise enables us to gain advantages over our competitors through superior acquisition sourcing, focused leasing programs, active asset and property management and first-class tenant service.

Significant Tenants
 
None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 321 employees, including 95 corporate employees and 226 on-site building and property management personnel. Certain of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
 

Insurance 
 
We carry commercial general liability coverage on our properties, with limits of liability customary within the industry. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct and indirect physical damage to our properties including coverage for the perils such as floods, earthquakes and windstorms. Our policies also cover the loss of rental income during an estimated reconstruction period. Our policies reflect limits and deductibles customary in the industry and specific to the buildings and portfolio. We also obtain title insurance policies when acquiring new properties. We currently have coverage for losses incurred in connection with both domestic and foreign terrorist-related activities. While we do carry commercial general liability insurance, property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our properties, these policies include limits and terms we consider commercially reasonable. In addition, there are certain losses (including, but not limited to, losses arising from known environmental conditions or acts of war) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in our belief, economically impractical to maintain such coverage. Should an uninsured loss arise against us, we would be required to use our own funds to resolve the issue, including litigation costs. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in consultation with our insurance advisors, we believe the properties in our portfolio are adequately insured. 
Competition 
 
The leasing of real estate is highly competitive in markets in which we operate. We compete with numerous acquirers, developers, owners and operators of commercial real estate, many of which own or may seek to acquire or develop properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. The principal means of competition are rent charged, location, services provided and the nature and condition of the facility to be leased. In addition, we face competition from other real estate companies including other REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, pension trusts, partnerships, individual investors and others that may have greater financial resources or access to capital than we do or that are willing to acquire properties in transactions which are more highly leveraged or are less attractive from a financial viewpoint than we are willing to pursue. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates, below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, in better locations within our markets or in higher quality facilities, we may lose potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain tenants when our tenants’ leases expire.

Environmental and Related Matters 
 
Under various federal, state and/or local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or release of hazardous substances, waste, or petroleum products at, on, in, under or from such property, including costs for investigation or remediation, natural resource damages, or third-party liability for personal injury or property damage. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such materials, and the liability may be joint and several. Some of our properties have been or may be impacted by contamination arising from current or prior uses of the property or adjacent properties for commercial, industrial or other purposes. Such contamination may arise from spills of petroleum or hazardous substances or releases from tanks used to store such materials. We also may be liable for the costs of remediating contamination at off-site disposal or treatment facilities when we arrange for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at such facilities, without regard to whether we comply with environmental laws in doing so. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination on our properties may adversely affect our ability to attract and/or retain tenants, and our ability to develop or sell or borrow against those properties. In addition to potential liability for cleanup costs, private plaintiffs may bring claims for personal injury, property damage or for similar reasons. Environmental laws also may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. Moreover, if contamination is discovered on our properties, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which that property may be used or how businesses may be operated on that property. 
 
Some of our properties may be adjacent to or near other properties used for industrial or commercial purposes or that have contained or currently contain underground storage tanks used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Releases from these properties could impact our properties. While certain properties contain or contained uses that could have or have impacted our properties, we are not aware of any liabilities related to environmental contamination that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 
In addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Noncompliance with these environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject us or our tenants to liability. These liabilities could affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us. Moreover, changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with such laws and regulations or increase liability for noncompliance. This may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations, or those of our tenants, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on us. We sometimes require our tenants to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities in our leases with them. But in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of any of our tenants to satisfy such obligations, we may be required to satisfy such obligations. We are not presently aware of any instances of material noncompliance with environmental or health and safety laws or regulations at our properties, and we believe that we and/or our tenants have all material permits and approvals necessary under current laws and regulations to operate our properties. 
 
As the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. For example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material (“ACM”). Environmental and health and safety laws require that ACM be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for noncompliance with those requirements. These requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if ACM would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. In addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of releases of ACM into the environment. We are not presently aware of any material liabilities related to building conditions, including any instances of material noncompliance with asbestos requirements or any material liabilities related to asbestos. In addition, our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or costs for remediation. When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. We are not presently aware of any material adverse indoor air quality issues at our properties.

Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”)
 
Our properties must comply with Title III of the ADA to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe the existing properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect.

Supplemental U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
 
The following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the prospectus dated May 3, 2018 contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on May 3, 2018.  
Consolidated Appropriations Act
 
The Consolidated Appropriations Act amended various provisions of the Code and implicates certain tax-related disclosures contained in the prospectus.  The discussion contained in the two paragraphs under “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations–Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders–Special FIRPTA Rules” is replaced with the following two paragraphs:
 
For periods on or after December 18, 2015, to the extent our stock is held directly (or indirectly through one or more partnerships) by a “qualified shareholder,” it will not be treated as a U.S. real property interest (“USRPI”). Further, to the extent such treatment applies, any distribution to such shareholder will not be treated as gain recognized from the sale or exchange of a USRPI. For these purposes, a qualified shareholder is generally a non-U.S. stockholder that (i)(A) is eligible for treaty benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States that includes an exchange of information program, and the principal class of interests of which is listed and regularly traded on one or more stock exchanges as defined by the treaty, or (B) is a foreign limited partnership organized in a jurisdiction with an exchange of information agreement with the United States and that has a class of regularly traded limited partnership units (having a value greater than 50% of the value of all partnership units) on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, (ii) is a “qualified collective investment vehicle” (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3)(B) of the Code) and (iii) maintains records of persons holding 5% or more of the class of interests described in clauses (i)(A) or (i)(B) above. However, in the case of a qualified shareholder having one or more “applicable investors,” the exception described in the first sentence of this paragraph will not apply to the applicable percentage of the qualified shareholder’s stock (with “applicable percentage” generally meaning the percentage of the value of the interests in the qualified shareholder held by applicable investors after applying certain constructive ownership rules). The applicable percentage of the amount realized by a qualified shareholder on the disposition of our stock or with respect to a distribution from us attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI will be treated as amounts realized from the disposition of USRPIs. Such treatment shall also apply to applicable investors in respect of distributions treated as a sale or exchange of stock with respect to a qualified shareholder. For these purposes, an “applicable investor” is a person who generally holds an interest in the qualified shareholder and holds more than 10% of our stock applying certain constructive ownership rules. 
 
For periods on or after December 18, 2015, for FIRPTA purposes neither a “qualified foreign pension fund” nor any entity all of the interests of which are held by a qualified foreign pension fund is treated as a non-U.S. stockholder. A “qualified foreign pension fund” is an organization or arrangement (i) created or organized in a foreign country, (ii) established by a foreign country (or one or more political subdivisions thereof) or one or more employers to provide retirement or pension benefits to current or former employees (including self-employed individuals) or their designees as a result of, or in consideration for, services rendered, (iii) which does not have a single participant or beneficiary that has a right to more than 5% of its assets or income, (iv) which is subject to government regulation and with respect to which annual information about its beneficiaries is provided, or is otherwise available, to relevant local tax authorities and (v) with respect to which, under its local laws, (A) contributions that would otherwise be subject to tax are deductible or excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate, or (B) taxation of its investment income is deferred, or such income is excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate. 
 

Recent FATCA Proposed Treasury Regulations
 
On December 18, 2018, the Internal Revenue Service promulgated proposed regulations under Sections 1471-1474 of the Code (commonly referred to as FATCA), which proposed regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on gross proceeds and thus implicate certain tax-related disclosures contained in the prospectus. While these regulations have not yet been finalized, taxpayers are generally entitled to rely on the proposed regulations (subject to certain limited exceptions). As a result, the discussion in the final sentence of the discussion under “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations–Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders–FATCA Withholding on Certain Foreign Accounts and Entities” is deleted and replaced with the following: 
 While withholding under FATCA would have applied to the gross proceeds from a disposition of property that can produce U.S. source interest or dividends after December 31, 2018, recently proposed Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed Treasury Regulations until final Treasury Regulations are issued. Withholding under FATCA currently applies with respect to other withholding payments, including, e.g., U.S. source interest and dividends.
