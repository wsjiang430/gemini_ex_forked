ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
 
Green Thumb Industries Inc. is a reporting issuer in the United States and Canada and the Company's Subordinate Voting Shares are listed for trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange (“CSE”) under the symbol “GTII.” The Company’s Subordinate Voting Shares (as hereinafter defined) are also traded in the United States on the OTCQX Best Market (the “OTCQX”) under the symbol “GTBIF.”
 
Originally founded in 2014, Green Thumb began operations in 2015 upon the award of a medical marijuana license for cultivation/processing and retail sale of cannabis in Illinois. The Company has since expanded its operational footprint to 15 U.S. markets, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia. Currently, Green Thumb owns, manufactures, and distributes a portfolio of cannabis consumer packaged goods brands including &Shine, Beboe, Dogwalkers, Doctor Solomon’s, Good Green, incredibles and RYTHM, to third-party retail stores across the United States as well as to Green Thumb owned retail stores (which we refer to as our Consumer Packaged Goods business). The Company also owns and operates retail cannabis stores that include a national chain called RISE, as well as retail stores operating under other names, many of which are in the process of being rebranded to RISE. Our retail stores sell a combination of our products and third-party products (which we refer to as our Retail business).
 
The Company, through its subsidiaries, owns state-licensed medical and/or adult-use marijuana businesses in California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia. We also license our intellectual property and certain brands to a licensee in Colorado. The following organizational chart describes the organizational structure of the Company as of December 31, 2022. See Exhibit 21.1 to this document for a list of subsidiaries of the Company. All lines represent 100% ownership of outstanding securities of the applicable subsidiary unless otherwise noted in Exhibit 21.1. In part, the complexity of our organization structure is due to state licensing requirements that mandate that we maintain the corporate identity of our operating license holders.
 


The registered office of the Company is located at 250 Howe Street, 20th Floor, Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 3R8. The head office is located at 325 W. Huron Street, Suite 700, Chicago, Illinois 60654.
 

History of the Company
 
For information on the history of the Company and the development of the business prior to June 13, 2018, the day our Subordinate Voting Shares began trading on the CSE, see the information set forth under the headings “Business – Our History” and “Business – General Development of the Business” in Amendment No. 2 to our Registration Statement on Form S-1 that was filed with the SEC on February 2, 2021 with Registration No. 333-248213.

Financing Activities
 
(i) Construction Loan
 
On October 12, 2022, the Company entered into a construction-to-permanent financing arrangement (the “Construction Loan”) which provided funding for the construction of a cultivation and processing facility in the amount of up to $31,000 thousand, which, as of December 31, 2022, the Company has drawn $18,345 thousand on the facility. The Construction Loan will bear interest at the U.S. prime rate plus 1%, with a floor of 5%, and mature upon the earlier of the completion of the construction, or 24 months from the date of issuance. Interest only payments became due on the first of each month beginning on November 1, 2022. Upon maturity, the Construction Loan will convert to a ten year mortgage note with a fixed interest rate of 3% over the weekly average yield of the U.S. treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of five years, with a floor of 5%. Payments of both principal and interest will be due on the first day of each calendar month following conversion of the Construction Loan.
(ii) Senior Secured Notes
 
On April 30, 2021, the Company closed a $216,734 thousand senior secured non-brokered private placement financing through the issuance of senior secured notes (the “April 30, 2021 Notes”) pursuant to the Second Amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”). The Company used the proceeds to retire the Company’s existing $105,466 thousand, senior secured notes due May 22, 2023 (the “May 22, 2019 Notes”) and the remaining proceeds for general working capital purposes as well as various growth initiatives. The April 30, 2021 Notes had a maturity date of April 30, 2024 and bear interest from the date of issue of 7.00% per annum, payable quarterly, with an option, at the discretion of the Company, to extend for an additional twelve months. The financing permitted the Company to borrow an additional $33,266 thousand over the next twelve months. The purchasers of the April 30, 2021 Notes also received 1,459,044 warrants (the “Warrants”) which allow the holder to purchase one Subordinate Voting Share of the Company at an exercise price of $32.68 per share, for a period of 60 months from the date of issue.
 
On October 15, 2021, the Company amended its existing Notes Purchase Agreement with the Second Amended Notes Purchase Agreement dated April 30, 2021, for the purposes of borrowing an additional $33,200 thousand, as permitted under the April 30, 2021 Notes Purchase Agreement (the “Amended Notes”). The additional borrowings have terms consistent with the April 30, 2021 Notes and increase the total amount borrowed to $249,934 thousand. The Company intends to use the additional proceeds for general working capital purposes as well as various growth initiatives. The purchasers of the Amended Notes received an additional 243,303 warrants which allow the holder to purchase one Subordinate Voting Share of the Company at an exercise price of $30.02 per share, for a period of 60 months from the date of issue.
 
On July 14, 2022, Green Thumb announced it exercised its right to extend the maturity date of the April 30, 2021 Notes by one year from April 30, 2024 to April 30, 2025. The April 30, 2021 Notes have a total principal amount of $249,934 thousand, and bear interest at a rate of 7.0% per annum that is paid quarterly. The extended maturity date did not involve any amendments to the April 30, 2021 Notes or any additional consideration to the existing lenders.

Description of the Business

Overview of the Company
 
Established in 2014 and headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Green Thumb promotes well-being through the power of cannabis through branded consumer packaged goods and people-first retail experiences, while giving back to the communities in which it serves. As of December 31, 2022, Green Thumb has operations across 15 U.S. markets, employs approximately 3,800 people and serves millions of patients and customers annually.
 
Green Thumb’s core business is manufacturing, distributing and marketing a portfolio of owned cannabis consumer packaged goods brands (which we refer to as our Consumer Packaged Goods business), including &Shine, Beboe, Dogwalkers, Doctor Solomon’s, Good Green, incredibles and RYTHM. The Company distributes and markets these products to third-party licensed retail cannabis stores across the United States as well as to Green Thumb-owned retail stores (which we refer to as our Retail business).
 
The Company’s Consumer Packaged Goods portfolio is primarily generated from plant material that Green Thumb grows and processes that we use to produce our consumer packaged goods in 18 owned and operated manufacturing facilities. This portfolio consists of stock keeping units (“SKUs”) across a range of cannabis product categories, including flower, pre-rolls, concentrates, vape, capsules, tinctures, edibles, topicals and other cannabis-related products (none of which product category are individually material to the Company). These Consumer Packaged Goods products are sold in retail locations throughout the 15 U.S. markets Green Thumb operates in including Green Thumb’s own RISE stores.

Green Thumb owns and operates a national cannabis retail chain called RISE that provides relationship-centric retail experiences aimed to deliver a superior level of customer service through high-engagement consumer interaction, a consultative, transparent and education-forward selling approach and a consistently available assortment of cannabis products. In addition, we own stores under other names, primarily where we co-own the stores or naming is subject to licensing or similar restrictions. The income from Green Thumb’s retail stores is primarily from the sale of cannabis-related products, which includes the sale of Green Thumb produced products as well as those produced by third parties, with an immaterial (less than 10%) portion of this income resulting from the sale of other merchandise (such as t-shirts and accessories for cannabis use). The RISE stores currently are located in 13 of the states in which we operate. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 77 open and operating retail locations. The Company’s new store opening plans will remain fluid depending on market conditions, our ability to obtain local licensing, construction and other permissions and subject to the Company’s capital allocation plans.
 
Financial Highlights and Revenue Streams
 
The Company has consolidated financial statements across its operating businesses with revenue from the manufacture, sale and distribution of branded cannabis products to third-party licensed retail customers as well as the sale of finished products to consumers in its retail stores.
 
The percentage of total revenue contributed by operations of the Consumer Packaged Goods segment was 25%, 31% and 29% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively. The percentage of total revenue contributed by the Retail segment was 75%, 69% and 71% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Item 7—“Management Discussion and Analysis” for details on key financial highlights.

As of the year ended December 31, 2022, Green Thumb has operating revenue in 15 markets (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia).
 


Geographic Information
 
Green Thumb operates in 15 U.S. states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia.
 


Product Research, Design and Development
 
The Company’s branded products portfolio includes SKUs across a range of product categories, including flower, pre-rolls, concentrates, vape, tinctures, edibles, topicals and other cannabis-related products. Green Thumb engages in research and development activities focused on developing new extracted or infused cannabis consumer packaged products.
Manufacturing
 
Our branded products are produced in manufacturing facilities across 14 U.S. states in which the primary activity is the cultivation, processing and manufacture of cannabis consumer packaged goods. The majority of our finished goods production is manufactured by our owned production facilities. However, we also have entered into manufacturing agreements with third parties, primarily for our cannabidiol (“CBD”) business lines, none of which account for more than 1% of finished goods production.

We aim to maintain strict brand and quality assurance standards and have implemented standard operating procedures across all production facilities to ensure continuity of product and consistent consumer experience across all operating markets.

Sources and Availability of Materials
 
Almost all of the raw material input, except packaging materials, used by the Company to produce finished cannabis consumer packaged goods are cultivated or processed internally for further use in the manufacturing process.
 
Significant Customers
 
Customers of our Consumer Packaged Goods business include legal state-licensed cannabis stores within each U.S. state in which we operate. The majority of our branded consumer packaged goods are distributed to unrelated third-party licensed retail cannabis stores. Green Thumb is not dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, and the loss of any one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on the business. No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenue during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020, respectively.
Merchandise
 
To meet the array of unique customer needs, we offer a variety of cannabis products at each of our RISE and other stores, totaling thousands of SKUs in managed inventory, covering a comprehensive list of packaged product categories including flower, concentrates, topicals (bath and beauty products) and edibles (confection, beverages, snacks).
 
We leverage our owned retail channel, RISE and our other stores to distribute our branded product portfolio, such as &Shine, Beboe, Dogwalkers, Doctor Solomon’s, Good Green, incredibles, and RYTHM.

All products that are sold have passed state-mandated third-party testing as required by applicable law to help assure that they do not contain impermissible levels of toxins, microbials or other harmful substances, and that they meet the Company's vendor requirements for quality assurance and reliability. Products are inventoried in a comprehensive seed-to-sale tracking software to minimize product slippage and inventory deviation.

Omnichannel Distribution
 
Our primary retail presence is traditional brick and mortar. However, as regulations allow, we expect to continue to expand our e-commerce, in-store guest pick-up and direct to consumer delivery capabilities as part of our commitment to providing a consistent retail brand experience no matter where the consumer might be.
Intellectual Property – Patents and Trademarks

We believe that brand protection is critical to our business strategy. We regularly seek to protect our intellectual property rights in connection with our operating names (e.g., Green Thumb and RISE), our consumer packaged goods (e.g., Dogwalkers and RYTHM) and certain patentable goods and services. The U.S. trademark statute, The Lanham Act, allows for the protection of trademarks and service marks on products and services used, or intended for use, lawfully. Because cannabis-related products and services remain illegal at the federal level under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811), we are not able to protect all our intellectual property at the federal level; therefore, we currently seek trademark protections at the state level where commercially feasible. Nonetheless, our success depends upon other areas of our business such as product development and design, production and marketing and not exclusively upon trademarks, patents and trade secrets.
 
As the Company became licensed to cultivate cannabis, we have developed proprietary cultivation techniques. The Company has also developed certain proprietary intellectual property for operating butane extraction, carbon dioxide extraction and ethanol extraction machinery, including production best practices, procedures and methods. This requires specialized skills in cultivation, extraction and refining.
 
The Company relies on its code of conduct agreements to protect its intellectual property rights. To the extent the Company describes or discloses its proprietary cultivation or extraction techniques in its applications for cultivation or processing licenses, the Company redacts or requests redaction of such information prior to public disclosure.

The Company has sought U.S. patent protection for certain of its Doctor Solomon’s products, namely a utility patent for compositions and methods for treating skin and neuropathic conditions and disorders. Where commercially reasonable, we will seek further U.S. patent protection on other eligible products and services. The Company owns several website domains, including www.gtigrows.com, numerous social media accounts across all major platforms, and various phone and web application platforms.
 
The Company has successfully registered over 80 trademarks across the United States and internationally and has additional trademark applications pending. The Company anticipates feedback on outstanding submitted applications on a rolling basis. As such, the Company will continue to rely on common law protection for these brands during the trademark registration process. Moreover, the Company will proactively seek intellectual property protection for brand expansions in current markets as well as any new market expansion. For additional details on the risks associated with the lack of trademark protection, see Item 1A—“Risk Factors” with respect to intellectual property.
 
For incredibles branded cannabis products, the Company has entered into a licensing contract with a third party that holds licenses to engage in the sale of cannabis in the state of Colorado, where the Company does not have licenses to operate cultivation and processing facilities. Such third party directly engages in or arranges for the sourcing, manufacturing, laboratory testing, quality assurance, storage, marketing, sales, distribution and delivery of products containing cannabis and remits licensing fees to the Company.
 


Joint Ventures
 
We utilize joint ventures when necessary to comply with state regulatory requirements in certain states. Partnering with one or more non-affiliated third parties provides the Company with the opportunity to mitigate certain operational and financial risks while ensuring continued compliance with the applicable regulatory guidelines. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has joint ventures for the operation of (i) a dispensary in Westport, Connecticut of which the Company holds a 46% interest, (ii) a Massachusetts operator of which the Company holds less than a 10% interest and (iii) a California-based cannabis-infused beverage company of which the Company holds a 20% interest.
Working Capital
 
Effective inventory management is critical to the Company’s ongoing success and the Company uses a variety of demand and supply forecasting, planning and replenishment techniques. The Company strives to maintain sufficient levels of inventory of core product categories, maintain positive vendor and customer relationships and carefully plan to minimize markdowns and inventory write-offs.

For additional details on liquidity and Capital Resources, see Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 
Number of Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, Green Thumb employs approximately 3,800 team members nationwide including corporate, retail and cultivation and processing, both full- and part-time employees, and including but not limited to: finance and accounting, legal and compliance, supply chain and operations, sales and marketing, commercial and cannabis agriculture, chemists, customer service, construction and project management, real estate, information technology and human resources. We offer a comprehensive package of company-sponsored benefits to our team. Eligibility depends on the full-time or part-time status, employee location and other factors, and benefits include participation in a 401(k) retirement savings plan, medical and dental plans, disability insurance, employee assistance programs and life insurance. Additionally, we believe in aligned incentives and use our employee stock and incentive plan for a competitive total rewards program.

Our employees are split across the Company as follows:
 

Corporate: | 324 
Retail: | 2,041
Cultivation and Processing: | 1,398
Total | 3,763

 
Approximately 350 of our employees at various cultivation and retail facilities have elected to be represented by a labor organization for purposes of collective bargaining.

Environmental Compliance
 
Expenditures for compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are consistent from year to year and are not material to the Company’s financials. The Company is compliant with all applicable regulations and does not use materials that would pose any known risk under normal conditions.



Competitive Conditions and the Company’s Position in the Industry

Competition
 
The markets in which the Company distributes its products and operates retail stores are highly competitive. Some of those markets have relatively high barriers to entry due to the licensing requirements. The Company competes directly with other cannabis producers and retailers, some of which operate only in a specific market and some of which operate across several U.S. markets. More broadly, Green Thumb views manufacturers of other consumer products, such as those in the pharmaceuticals, alcohol, tobacco, health and beauty and functional wellness industries, as potential competitors. Product quality, performance, new product innovation and development, packaging, customer experience and consumer price/value are important differentiating factors.
 
The Company faces competition from other companies that may have a longer operating history, a higher capitalization, additional financial resources, more manufacturing and marketing experience, greater access to public equity and debt markets and more experienced management than the Company. Increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The vast majority of both manufacturing and retail competitors in our markets consist of localized businesses (i.e. doing business in only a single state market). There are a few multistate operators with whom the Company competes directly in several of the Company’s operating markets. Aside from this direct competition, out-of-state operators that are capitalized well enough to enter those markets through acquisitions are also part of the competitive landscape. Similarly, as the Company executes its national U.S. growth strategy, operators in our future state markets will inevitably become direct competitors.

Because of the early stage of the industry in which the Company operates, the Company faces additional competition from new entrants. If the number of consumers of medical and adult-use cannabis in the states in which the Company operates its business increases, the demand for products will increase and the Company expects that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products and as states make more cannabis licenses available. To remain competitive, the Company will require a continued high level of investment in research and development, marketing, sales and client support. The Company may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development, marketing, sales and client support efforts on a competitive basis, which could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of its operations.

In addition, the Company experiences significant competition for its products from illicit operators who are not licensed pursuant to their state’s cannabis laws and regulations. Moreover, markets across the United States have seen the widespread proliferation of hemp-based products purporting to contain psychoactive amounts of THC, including Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol, Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, and many other cannabinoids derived or synthesized from hemp that purport to cause a psychoactive effect (“psychoactive hemp-based products”). Most psychoactive hemp-based products on the market are derived from the chemical conversion of hemp-derived cannabidiol (“CBD”). These products are marketed in a legal grey area due to ambiguities created in the 2018 Farm Bill that effectively legalized hemp (cannabis containing less than 0.3% percent THC) on a national level. These psychoactive hemp-based products are frequently not being manufactured and distributed in the U.S by state-licensed cannabis processors and dispensaries. Instead, they are being manufactured and distributed by, for example, convenience stores, gas stations, smoke shops, head shops, and the Internet. These products do not appear to be subject to the testing, packaging, labeling, licensing and other requirements applicable to the Company’s products such as seed-to-sale tracking (which makes product recalls possible) and are being sold without state-mandated cannabis excise taxes applied, thus leading to significant price differentials with the Company’s products.

Given the pricing differential and the absence of state cannabis excise taxes, the continued proliferation of unregulated psychoactive hemp-based products through unlicensed distribution points could ultimately alter certain elements of the current cannabis market in the U.S. Recently, however, several states have begun to promulgate new regulations and interpretations of existing regulations that effectively prohibit the development of these products. If this trend continues, the potential impact of psychoactive hemp-based products on the cannabis market could be blunted. Proposed federal legislation, if passed, could also severely limit or prevent altogether the proliferation of psychoactive hemp-based products.

 See Item 1A—“Risk Factors” for more information with respect to competition.
 


Federal and State Regulation of Cannabis
 
Below is a discussion of the federal and state-level regulatory regimes in the jurisdictions where the Company is currently operating through its subsidiaries.
 
Federal illegality of Cannabis

The U.S. federal government regulates drugs through the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. Schedule I controlled substances are federally illegal and the manufacturing, sale and use of cannabis is a violation of federal law.
 
Due to the conflicting views between state legislatures and the federal government regarding cannabis, cannabis businesses are subject to inconsistent laws and regulations. The Obama Administration attempted to address the inconsistent treatment of cannabis under state and federal law in the Cole Memorandum that Deputy Attorney General James Cole sent to all U.S. Attorneys in August 2013. The Cole Memorandum noted that, in jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form and that have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with such laws and regulations was not a prosecution or enforcement priority for the Department of Justice.

On January 4, 2018, then U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum. Despite its rescission, as of December 31, 2022, federal prosecutors appear to continue to use the Cole Memorandum’s priorities as an enforcement guide. Attorney General Merrick Garland stated during his congressional testimony in February 2021, that the Justice Department would not pursue cases against Americans complying with laws of the states that have legalized and are regulating marijuana. In October 2022, President Joseph R. Biden, announced that marijuana scheduling under federal law would be reviewed, noting that marijuana is scheduled as more dangerous than fentanyl and methamphetamine, two substances that are driving an overdose epidemic in the country. In October 2022, President Biden also announced a mass pardon of persons who had been convicted of simple marijuana possession under federal law. In December 2022, President Biden signed the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act into law, which provides for significantly broader opportunities to study cannabis.

As an industry best practice, the Company continues to employ the following policies to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:

•Our operations and our subsidiaries’ operations are compliant with all licensing requirements as established by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough and other political/administrative divisions; to this end, we retain appropriately experienced legal counsel to help ensure compliance of such operations with all applicable licensing requirements; 
 
•The cannabis-related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained - for example, in states where only medical cannabis is permitted, the products are only sold to patients who hold the necessary documentation to permit the possession of the cannabis; in states where cannabis is permitted for adult-use, the products are only sold to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements; 
 
•Our operating subsidiaries must pass a range of requirements, adhere to strict business practice standards and be subject to strict regulatory oversight to ensure that no revenue is distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs or cartels; 
 
•We have implemented an inventory tracking system and necessary procedures to help ensure that such compliance system is effective in tracking inventory and preventing diversion of cannabis or cannabis products, and we employ strict customer identification protocols to prevent sales to minors; 
 
•Our state-authorized cannabis business activity is not used as a cover or pretense for trafficking of other illegal drugs, and we are not engaged in any other illegal activity; and 
 
•We conduct reviews of products and product packaging to ensure that such products and product packaging comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products. 
 

There have been efforts at reforming federal cannabis law. As of December 31, 2022, there were more than a dozen proposed congressional bills addressing myriad regarding the cannabis industry, from banking and tax reform to full legalization. However, none have passed into law.

There does exist a legislative safeguard for the medical cannabis industry, appended to the federal budget bill. For each year since 2015, Congress has adopted a so-called “rider” provision to the Consolidated Appropriations Acts (formerly referred to as the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment and currently referred to as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment) to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal law against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. On December 29, 2022, the amendment was renewed as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Acts of 2023, H.R. 2617, which is effective through September 30, 2023.

The sheer size of the cannabis industry, in addition to participation by state and local governments and investors, suggests that a large-scale federal enforcement operation would more than likely create unwanted political backlash for the Department of Justice and the current administration. Regardless, cannabis remains illegal at the federal level. The U.S. federal government has always reserved the right to enforce federal law over the sale and disbursement of medical or adult-use cannabis, even if state law authorizes such sale and disbursement. There is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will remain in place or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the Controlled Substances Act with respect to cannabis, there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law criminalizing cannabis.

We will continue to monitor compliance on an ongoing basis in accordance with our compliance program and standard operating procedures. While our operations are in compliance with all applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements, such activities remain illegal under federal law. For the reasons described above and the risks further described in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” there are significant risks associated with our business. Readers of this Form are strongly encouraged to carefully read all of the risk factors contained in Item 1A—“Risk Factors.”

Federal Law and Ability to Access Public and Private Capital

Due to the present state of the laws and regulations governing financial institutions in the U.S., banks often refuse to provide services to businesses involved in the cannabis industry and U.S. multistate operators are currently not permitted to list securities on the U.S. securities exchanges. Consequently, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing from large U.S. financial institutions.
 
We have historically, and continue to have, access to equity and debt financing from non-public (i.e., private placement) markets and state-chartered financial institutions. Our executive team and Board also have extensive relationships with sources of capital (such as funds and high net worth individuals).

In addition to our working capital, we continue to generate adequate cash to fund our operations from capital raising transactions. Our business plan continues to include growth, in the form of acquisitions and through facility expansion and improvements. Accordingly, we expect to raise additional capital, both in the form of debt and new equity offerings, during the next few years.

However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or on terms that are acceptable.

Restricted Access to Banking and Other Financial Services

The United States Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Networks, which we refer to as “FinCEN”, issued the FinCEN Memorandum on February 14, 2014, outlining the pathways for financial institutions to back cannabis businesses in compliance with federal enforcement priorities. These guidelines include burdensome due diligence expectations and reporting requirements. The FinCEN Memorandum outlines the pathways for financial institutions to bank state-sanctioned cannabis businesses in compliance with federal enforcement priorities. The FinCEN Memorandum echoed the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum and states that, in some circumstances, it is permissible for banks to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of federal money laundering laws. Under these guidelines, financial institutions must submit a Suspicious Activity Report in connection with all cannabis-related banking activities by any client of such financial institution, in accordance with federal money laundering laws.



However, the FinCEN Memorandum does not provide any safe harbors or legal defenses from examination or regulatory or criminal enforcement actions by the Department of Justice, FinCEN or other federal regulators for banks and other financial institutions and can be amended or revoked at any time. Thus, most banks and other financial institutions in the United States do not appear comfortable relying on this guidance to provide banking services to the cannabis industry. Banks and/or card networks may also refuse to process debit card payments and credit card companies generally refuse to process credit card payments for cannabis-related businesses. In addition, federal money laundering statutes and regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, discourage financial institutions from working with any organization that sells a controlled substance, regardless of whether the state in which it operates permits cannabis sales. The inability or limitation on our ability to open or maintain bank accounts, obtain other banking services and/or accept credit card and debit card payments may make it difficult for us to operate and conduct our business as planned or to operate efficiently.

On March 7, 2019, Democratic U.S. representative Ed Perlmutter of Colorado introduced the SAFE Banking Act, which would protect banks and their employees from punishment for providing services to cannabis businesses that are legal on a state level. The bill passed with strong bipartisan support in the House of Representatives on September 25, 2019. The House passed the SAFE Banking Act numerous times since then, most recently on February 4, 2022, as an amendment to the America COMPETES Act. However, the SAFE Banking Act failed to pass in the U.S. Senate. It was not introduced for formal voting, nor was it included in the December 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act.

State Cannabis Law

State laws that permit and regulate the production, distribution and use of cannabis for adult-use or medical purposes are in direct conflict with federal law. Although certain states and territories of the U.S. authorize medical and/or adult-use cannabis production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under U.S. federal law, the possession, use, cultivation and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia are criminal acts under the Controlled Substances Act. Although the Company’s activities are believed to be compliant with applicable state and local laws, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under U.S. federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding that may be brought against the Company.
 
As of December 31, 2022, 37 states, (and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands and the District of Columbia) have legalized the cultivation and sale of cannabis for medical purposes. In 21 of those states, the sale and possession of cannabis is legal for both medical and adult-use, and the District of Columbia has legalized adult-use but not commercial sale. In November 2020, voters in Arizona, Montana and New Jersey voted by referendum to legalize cannabis for adult-use, and voters in Mississippi legalized cannabis for medical use. In February 2021, adult-use cannabis became legal in New Jersey. Adult-use cannabis was legalized in New York one month later in March 2021. Adult-use was legalized in Connecticut in June 2021. Virginia became the first southern state to legalize cannabis for adult-use in July 2021. In May of 2022, Rhode Island’s governor passed its adult-use measure into law. In November 2022, Maryland and Missouri voters passed ballot measures approving adult-use, with both programs expected to begin in 2023.
 
Company’s Medical-Only Markets

All of the medical-only markets in which the Company does business (Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia) have written regulations that impose limitations on the number of cannabis business licenses that can be awarded by the state. In each of these markets, we have a proven track record of: (i) entering the market through state-granted awards based on the merit of our application and business plans; and/or (ii) expanding market reach through accretive mergers, acquisitions, and partnership ventures. Each medical use market that also allows adult-use (including Illinois, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey and Rhode Island) has regulations specifying which medical conditions qualify a patient for a license to purchase cannabis, and generally require the approval from a physician. Maryland, New York and Virginia have also legalized adult-use cannabis, but have not fully launched their adult-use programs. As of December 31, 2022, there was only one adult-use dispensary in New York. In Virginia, there is currently no date for the start of adult-use retail sales.
Company’s Adult-Use Markets

The Company has adult-use operations in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey and Rhode Island. The Company also has a licensing and distribution contract with a third party that holds licenses to engage in the sale of cannabis in Colorado for incredibles branded cannabis products. Many of the adult-use markets in which the Company operates have fewer barriers to entry and more closely reflect free market dynamics typically seen in mature retail and manufacturing industries. The growth of these markets poses a risk of increased competition. However, management views the Company’s market share as less at risk than operators without a current operating footprint due to our established brand recognition and supply and distribution chains. Purchasers of adult-use cannabis generally are subject to higher sales taxes than those that apply to purchasers who are authorized for medical purposes. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that some consumers who meet the criteria to apply for medical licenses make adult-use purchases and avoid pursuing a state’s medical registration/qualification process.
Regulatory Environment in States Where We Operate
 
The risk of federal enforcement and other risks associated with the Company’s business are described in Item 1A—“Risk Factors.”
 
Regulation of the Cannabis Market at State and Local Level

Following the thesis that distributing brands at scale will win, we enter markets where we believe that we can profitably and sustainably operate and command significant market share, and thus maximize consumer and brand awareness.
 
Each state in which we operate specifies the types of cannabis licenses that are required for the various activities in which we engage. There are three primary types of licenses: cultivation, processing, and retail/dispensary. Cultivation licenses generally permit the holder to acquire and cultivate cannabis and sell that cannabis to dispensaries or processors. Some states allow cultivation license holders to process cannabis into marijuana-infused products as well, while other states require a separate processing license for this activity. Retail dispensary licenses permit the holder to purchase cannabis from cultivation or processing facilities and sell those products to individuals approved under their state’s medical cannabis program or, where adult-use is permitted, to adults over the age of 21. Some states require a separate license for each activity, while others issue a single vertically integrated license that allows the holder to cultivate, process, and sell cannabis.
 
Below is a summary overview of the regulatory and competitive frameworks in each of our operating markets. See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a state-by-state list of the licenses and permits held by us.
 
California
 
California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana through Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996.

In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act. In November 2016, voters in California overwhelmingly passed Proposition 64, the Adult-Use of Marijuana Act creating an adult-use marijuana program for adults 21 years of age or older. The Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act, which provides for a single set of regulations to govern a medical and adult-use licensing went into effect on January 1, 2018.
 
The three agencies that regulate cannabis at the state level are: (a) the California Department of Food and Agriculture, via CalCannabis, which issues licenses to cannabis cultivators; (b) the California Department of Public Health, via the Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch, which issues licenses to cannabis manufacturers; and (c) the California Department of Consumer Affairs, via the Bureau of Cannabis Control, which issues licenses to cannabis distributors, testing laboratories, retailers and micro-businesses.
 
California License and Regulations

In order to legally operate a medical or adult-use cannabis business in California, the operator must have both a local and state license. This requires license holders to operate in cities with cannabis licensing programs. Municipalities in California are allowed to determine the number of licenses they will issue to cannabis operators or can choose to ban cannabis businesses outright.

In 2021, we opened our first California retail operation in Pasadena. We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by California.
 

See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses and conditional licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in California.
 
Colorado
 
On November 7, 2000, Colorado voters approved Amendment 20, which amended the state constitution to allow the use of marijuana in the state by approved patients with written medical consent.

Amendment 64 passed on November 6, 2012, which amended the state constitution to establish a cannabis program in Colorado and permit the commercial cultivation, manufacture and sale of marijuana to adults 21 years of age or older. The commercial sale of marijuana for adult-use to the general public began on January 1, 2014.
 
Colorado License and Regulations
 
In Colorado, cannabis businesses must comply with local licensing requirements in addition to state licensing requirements in order to operate. Colorado localities are allowed to limit or prohibit the operation of marijuana cultivation facilities, product manufacturing facilities or retail stores facilities.
 
There are three principal license categories in Colorado: (1) cultivation, (2) product manufacturer and (3) medical center/retail store. Each facility is authorized to engage only in the type of activity for which it is licensed.

We do not have any licenses in the State of Colorado. We have a licensing and distribution contract with a third party that holds licenses to engage in the sale of cannabis in Colorado for incredibles branded cannabis products. Such third party directly engages in or arranges for the sourcing, manufacturing, laboratory testing, quality assurance, storage, marketing, sales, distribution and delivery of products containing cannabis and remits licensing fees to us. See Item 1—“Intellectual Property Patents and Trademarks” for details on licenses with respect to operations in Colorado.
 
Regulations for the production and sale of marijuana in Colorado are published through the Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Department of Revenue.

Connecticut
 
Connecticut’s medical cannabis program was introduced in May 2012 when the General Assembly passed legislation PA 12-55 “An Act Concerning the Palliative Use of Marijuana,” providing for the use of marijuana in the state by approved patients with written consent from a physician or advanced practice nurse. In June 2021, PA 21-1 was signed into law, legalizing adult-use cannabis as of July 1, 2021. The first adult-use sales in the state began in January 2023. On July 1, 2021, PA 21-1 went into effect, allowing for the purchase and use of cannabis by any adult over the age of 21.
Connecticut Licenses and Regulations

The Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection has issued regulations regarding the Medical Marijuana and Adult-use Programs in Connecticut.

There are two principal medical marijuana license categories in Connecticut: (1) cultivation/processing and (2) dispensary. We are licensed to operate one hybrid adult-use/medical marijuana cultivation/processing facility two medical marijuana dispensaries and one hybrid adult-use/medical marijuana dispensary. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Connecticut. Each facility licensee is independently issued.

See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Connecticut.
 


Florida
 
In 2016, the Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization Initiative was introduced by citizen referendum and passed on November 8, 2016. This language, known as “Amendment 2,” amended the state constitution and mandated an expansion of the state’s medical cannabis program, which was previously limited to patients suffering from a diagnosed terminal condition.
 
Amendment 2, and the resulting expansion of qualifying medical conditions, became effective on January 3, 2017. On June 9, 2017, the Florida House of Representatives and Florida Senate passed respective legislation to implement the expanded program, which officially became law on June 23, 2017.
 
Florida Licenses and Regulations

There is one principal license category in Florida: the vertically-integrated Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers (“MMTC”) license. Licenses are issued by the Florida Department of Health, Office of Medical Marijuana Use, and license holders can only own one license. There is no limit on the number of facilities that can be operated under an MMTC license. We currently are approved to operate two medical cannabis cultivation/processing facilities and seven medical cannabis dispensaries under our single MMTC license. All operating facilities are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Florida.

As our operations in Florida are vertically-integrated, we are able to cultivate, harvest, process and sell/dispense/deliver our own medical cannabis products.

We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by Florida.
 
See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Florida.
 
Illinois
 
In 2013, the Illinois General Assembly passed the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act, which went into effect on January 1, 2014, allowing the use of marijuana in the state by approved patients with written medical consent. In June 2019, the Governor signed the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, legalizing cannabis for adult-use and the law went into effect on June 25, 2019. Adult-use sales of cannabis began in the state on January 1, 2020.
Illinois Licenses and Regulations
 
There are four principal license categories in Illinois: (1) cultivation (which includes processing); (2) infusing; (3) transportation; and (4) dispensary. Dispensaries are regulated by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation; the remainder are regulated by the Department of Agriculture. Licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Illinois. We have two cultivation facilities operating under two cultivation licenses. We have 10 operating dispensaries, which is the statutory cap, operating under 15 total licenses (10 adult-use dispensary licenses and 5 medical dispensary licenses). By applicable law, we are not permitted to add medical dispensary licenses to the 5 locations that only have adult-use sales.

We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by Illinois.
 
See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued us with respect to our operations in Illinois.

New York

In July 2014, the New York Legislature and Governor enacted the Compassionate Care Act to provide a comprehensive, safe and effective medical marijuana program. The Compassionate Care Act provides access to the program for those who suffer from qualifying conditions and have a physician's recommendation.

In 2021, the Marijuana Regulation and Tax Act (“MRTA”) was signed into law. The MRTA legalized adult-use cannabis and established the New York Office of Cannabis Management, which continues to promulgate rules and regulations. As of December 31, 2022, only one adult-use dispensary had been approved to begin sales.

New York Licenses and Regulations

The Office of Cannabis Management is the regulatory agency that oversees the adult-use and medical marijuana program in New York. There is currently one principal medical license category in New York: Registered Organization (a vertically integrated license).

We hold a Registered Organization license, which allows us to operate one medical marijuana cultivation/manufacturing facility and four medical marijuana dispensaries. Under the MRTA we have the right to open an additional four medical dispensaries. We currently operate three medical dispensaries and we have a cultivation/manufacturing facility under construction. All operating facilities are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of New York. Only registered pharmacists can dispense medical marijuana to approved patients and caregivers.

There are nine principal adult-use license types: (1) Cultivator, (2) Processor, (3) Cooperative, (4) Distributor, (5) Retail Dispensary, (6) Microbusiness, (7) Delivery, (8) Nursery, and (9) On-site Consumption.

There will also be two adult-use licenses available to registered medical marijuana businesses: (1) Registered Organization Adult-use Cultivator Processor Distributor Retail Dispensary and (2) Registered Organization Adult-use Cultivator Processor Distributor.

Other than a microbusiness licensee and a Registered Organization Adult-use Cultivator Processor Distributor Retail Dispensary licensee, no person may hold an interest in both a cultivation/processing type license and a dispensing or retail sales type of license.

We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by New York.

See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in New York.



Ohio
 
House Bill 523, effective on September 8, 2016, legalized medical marijuana in Ohio. The Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program allows people with certain medical conditions, upon the recommendation of an Ohio-licensed physician certified by the State Medical Board, to purchase and use medical marijuana.
Ohio License and Regulations
 
There are three principal license categories in Ohio: (1) cultivation, (2) processing and (3) dispensary.

Rhode Island
 
Rhode Island legalized medical marijuana in 2006. Under this law, Rhode Island offers medical marijuana registration cards for patients with qualifying conditions and physician approval.

After a successful ballot measure, Rhode Island’s governor signed two measures into law in May of 2022 approving sales in the state for adults who are at least 21 years old. Adult-use sales commenced on December 1, 2022 for the five licensed medical marijuana compassion centers which were approved for hybrid retail licenses. These hybrid retail licenses allow the centers to sell both medical and adult-use marijuana products in retail settings.
Rhode Island Licensure and Regulations
 
There are two categories of medical cannabis licensure in Rhode Island: compassion center (which includes cultivation and dispensary) and cultivator. The program is overseen by the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation, Office of Cannabis Regulation.

After the passage of Rhode Island’s adult-use law in 2022, existing operators became eligible to receive hybrid licenses, allowing them to cultivate and/or sell cannabis to adults ages 21 and over. The Cannabis Control Commission, which as of December 31, 2022 has not been formed, is to oversee regulations and additional licensing under the adult-use law.

In 2021, we acquired two entities that held management agreements with Summit Medical Compassion Center, Inc., a non-profit corporation with cultivation and retail operations. Both the cultivation and retail operations received hybrid licensure in 2022, allowing them to grow and sell to the adult-use market.

We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by Rhode Island.

See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Rhode Island.
 
Virginia
 
In 2017, Virginia passed a law that allowed patients suffering from intractable epilepsy access to cannabidiol (“CBD”) or THC-A oil. In 2018, this law was significantly expanded, which allowed any medical condition to qualify with state-certified physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant recommendation. The next year, the law was amended to allow for higher potency THC. In February 2021, cannabis was legalized for adult-use. There is currently no date for the start of adult-use retail sales.
Virginia License and Regulations
 
There are currently two principal license categories in Virginia: (1) pharmaceutical processing and (2) dispensing. The primary regulatory body for cannabis is the Virginia Department of Health Professions: Board of Pharmacy. A pharmaceutical processor must obtain a permit from the Board of Pharmacy.

A cannabis dispensing facility is owned, at least in part, by a pharmaceutical processor.

We have one pharmaceutical processor permit and four dispensary permits. We have the right to open two more dispensaries pending regulatory approval.

We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by Virginia.

See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Virginia.
 


State License Renewal Requirements
 
For each of our provisional and operational licenses, the states impose strict license renewal requirements that vary state by state. We generally must complete the renewal application process within a prescribed period of time prior to the expiration date and pay an application fee. The state licensing body can deny or revoke licenses and renewals for a variety of reasons, including (a) submission of materially inaccurate, incomplete or fraudulent information, (b) failure of the company or any of its directors or officers to comply, or have a history of non-compliance, with any applicable law or regulation, including laws relating to minimum age of customers, safety and non-diversion of cannabis or cannabis products, taxes, child support, workers compensation and insurance coverage, or failure to otherwise remain in good standing (c) failure to submit or implement a plan of correction for any identified violation, (d) attempting to assign registration to another entity without state approval, (e) insufficient financial resources, (f) committing, permitting, aiding or abetting of any illegal practices in the operation of a facility, (g) failure to cooperate or give information to relevant law enforcement related to any matter arising out of conduct at a licensed facility and (h) lack of responsible operations, as evidenced by negligence, disorderly or unsanitary facilities or permitting a person to use a registration card belonging to another person. Certain jurisdictions also require licensees to attend a public hearing or forum in connection with their license renewal application.
Newly Established Legal Regime
 
Our business activities rely on newly established and/or developing laws and regulations in the states in which we operate. These laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and subject to change with minimal notice. Regulatory changes may adversely affect our profitability or cause us to cease operations entirely. The cannabis industry may come under further scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration, the SEC, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Advisory and other regulatory authorities that supervise or regulate the production, distribution, sale and use of cannabis for medical and nonmedical purposes in the United States. It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed. The regulatory uncertainty surrounding the industry may adversely affect our business and operations, including without limitation, the costs to remain compliant with applicable laws and the impairment of our business or the ability to raise additional capital.
