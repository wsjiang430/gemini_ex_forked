Item 1. | Business

Overview
As a worldwide marketing solutions partner dedicated to creating a better way, Quad uses its data-driven, integrated marketing solutions platform to help clients reduce complexity, increase efficiency and enhance marketing spend effectiveness. Quad provides its clients with unmatched scale for client on-site services and expanded subject expertise in marketing strategy, creative solutions, media deployment and marketing management services. With a client-centric approach, that drives its expanded offering, combined with leading-edge technology and single-source simplicity, the Company believes it has the resources and knowledge to help a wide variety of clients in multiple vertical industries, including retail, publishing and healthcare.
Quad was founded in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, as a Wisconsin corporation, in 1971 by the late Harry V. Quadracci. As of February 11, 2019, the Quadracci family, through the Quad Voting Trust, has voting control of approximately 72%, which the Company believes provides it with continued stability and flexibility as Quad works to achieve its long-term strategic vision. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 20,600 full-time equivalent employees in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, and served a diverse base of approximately 6,100 clients. Quad locations span 15 countries, including 60 manufacturing and distribution facilities and more than 60 client-based marketing on-site locations, with additional investments in printing operations in Brazil and India.
The Company is on a transformative journey that it describes in evolutions. Each new evolution expands the Company’s offerings to create enhanced value for its clients. Quad 1.0 covered a period of tremendous organic growth that began with its founding in 1971. During this 40-year period, the Company grew rapidly through greenfield growth, built a premier manufacturing and distribution platform equipped with the latest technology, established its reputation as one of the printing industry’s foremost innovators and created a Company culture based on strong values that remains in place today.
Quad 2.0 began in 2010 and continues today with Quad’s ongoing role as a disciplined print industry consolidator. Quad saw an opportunity to participate in industry consolidation in response to economic and industry pressures following the great recession of 2008 and 2009, which severely impacted print volumes and accelerated the impact of media disruption. Through a series of consolidating acquisitions that included World Color Press, Inc. (“World Color Press”), Vertis Holdings Inc. and Brown Printing Company, the Company added experienced talent and was able to enhance and expand its product and service offerings, while removing inefficient and underutilized capacity, pulling out costs and transitioning work to more efficient facilities. This period of consolidation created the advanced, highly automated and efficient manufacturing and distribution platform the Company has today.
The Company believes it will continue to drive productivity improvements into the future through an engaged workforce and ongoing adoption of the latest manufacturing automation and technology. Through this strategy, the Company believes it can maintain the strongest, most efficient print manufacturing platform and remain the high-quality, low-cost producer. This strategy also allows Quad to generate the earnings and cash flow necessary to support future value-creating opportunities that fuel Quad 3.0.
Quad 3.0 evolved when significant media disruption created the opportunity for Quad to create greater value for its clients by extending its offering beyond print and content execution to include an integrated stack of marketing services. In Quad 3.0, the Company leverages its data-driven print expertise as part of an integrated marketing solutions platform that helps its clients not only plan and produce marketing programs, but also deploy, manage and measure them across all traditional and digital channels. In February 2019, the Company announced that it is evolving its brand from Quad/Graphics to Quad to reflect the role it now plays with clients as a marketing solutions partner.

Industry and Competition
According to a December 2018 Dun & Bradstreet First Research report, the U.S. advertising services industry is forecast to grow at an annual compounded rate of 4% between 2018 and 2022, as compared to the printing industry which is in secular decline. This opportunity for growth supports Quad’s 3.0 transformation and a review of both the marketing services and printing industries is set forth below.
The marketing services industry is highly fragmented. According to the December 2018 Dun & Bradstreet First Research report, the top 50 companies in the U.S. advertising and marketing services industry generate less than 40% of industry revenue. Services in this industry include advertising for print, broadcast and online media (about 25% of industry sales); public relations (12%); and direct marketing (10%). Other services include display advertising, media buying (reselling advertising time or space), and media representation (selling advertising time or space on behalf of media outlet owners). The U.S. advertising and marketing services industry includes about 38,000 establishments (single-location companies and units of multi-location companies), with combined annual revenue of about $100 billion.
The commercial print industry is also highly fragmented. According to the September 2018 Printing in the U.S. IBISWorld industry report, the United States commercial printing industry, in the aggregate, generates an estimated $76 billion in annual revenue, employs over 430,000 people and is comprised of approximately 48,000 companies. The report also states that no printing company accounts for more than 5% of total commercial print industry annual revenue in the United States. Although there has been significant industry consolidation, particularly in the past decade, the largest 400 U.S. printers only represent approximately half of the total industry revenue in the U.S., according to the December 2018 Printing Impressions PI400 rankings.
In addition to being highly fragmented, competition in the printing industry remains intense, and the Company believes that there are indicators of heightened competitive pressures. The industry has excess manufacturing capacity created by continued declines in industry volumes which, in turn, have created accelerated downward pricing pressures. The Company faces competition due to the increased accessibility and quality of digital alternatives to traditional delivery of printed documents through the online distribution and hosting of media content, and the digital distribution of documents and data. The Company faces competition from print management and marketing consulting firms that look to streamline processes and reduce the overall print spend of the Company’s clients. 
The commercial print industry has moved toward a demand for shorter print runs, faster product turnaround and increased production efficiency of products with lower page counts and increased complexity. This, combined with increases in postage expenses and the increased use of digital marketing and communication channels, has led to excess manufacturing capacity in the print industry. This excess capacity has allowed certain larger printers, like Quad, with economies of scale, strong balance sheets and access to capital markets, the ability to invest in automation and more efficient equipment, take advantage of consolidating acquisition opportunities to remove excess, inefficient and/or underutilized capacity, and reduce overall costs.

Competition in both the marketing services and print industries is affected by real gross domestic product growth, as economic activity and advertising spending are key drivers of consumer demand. In times of economic prosperity, advertisers may increase spending to build brand awareness and to drive sales. Conversely, in times of global economic uncertainty and budget pressures, advertisers may reduce spending or shift their spending to other forms of media. For print specifically, magazine publishers that face diminished advertising pages reduce total page counts; catalog marketers reduce page counts, circulation and frequency of print campaigns; retailers curb investments in store inventory and cut back on retail insert newspaper circulation and advertising; and other advertisers reduce their direct mail volume, particularly in the banking, insurance, credit card, real estate and nonprofit industries. It is possible that these customers instead decide to move advertising spend to digital alternatives.
Marketing services providers face pressure to satisfy major clients’ needs, as the win or loss of a major client account can impact revenue significantly. Another challenge facing marketing service providers relates to public concern and general annoyance with advertising methods. For example, data collection of personal information for marketing purposes is an issue under scrutiny from federal legislation, and marketing service providers are facing future restrictions on certain types of data they collect. In Europe, the European Union already has been enforcing data protection through the General Data Protection Regulations.
The Company faces competition in the advertising and marketing services industry based on access to a skilled workforce, pricing, adapting quickly to new technology, creating unique and effective campaigns and offering superior customer service. Across Quad’s range of printed products, competition is based on total price of printing, materials and distribution; quality; distribution capabilities; customer service; access to a highly skilled workforce; availability to schedule work on appropriate equipment; on-time production and delivery; and state-of-the-art technology to meet a client’s business objectives, including the ability to adopt new technology quickly.
As consumer media consumption habits change, marketing services providers face increased demand to offer end-to-end marketing services, from strategy and creative through execution, across all channels, traditional and digital. As new marketing and advertising channels emerge, marketing services providers must expand their services beyond traditional channels, such as for television, newspapers, print publications and radio, to digital channels, such as mobile, internet search, internet display and video, to create effective multichannel campaigns for their clients.
Quad believes that business users of print and print-related services are focused on generating and tracking the highest returns on their marketing spend. Quad believes it is well positioned to help clients achieve greater process efficiencies and marketing spend effectiveness through data-driven integrated marketing solutions. The Company believes that its clients receive the greatest return on their marketing spend when they start with a strong marketing strategy that uses print in combination with other media channels, informed by customer data, to create targeted and relevant multichannel marketing campaigns.
Seasonality
Quad is subject to seasonality in its quarterly results as net sales and operating income are higher in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year as compared to the first and second quarters. The fourth quarter is typically the highest seasonal quarter for cash flows from operating activities and Free Cash Flow due to the reduction of working capital requirements that reach peak levels during the third quarter. Seasonality is driven by increased magazine advertising page counts, retail inserts, catalogs and books primarily due to back-to-school and holiday-related advertising and promotions. The Company expects this seasonality impact to continue in future years.
Strategy
Quad believes employee pride, combined with a relentless quest to create a better way, builds the opportunity to invent the future as a preferred marketing solutions partner, helping its clients win every day. To accomplish this vision, Quad remains focused on its consistent strategic priorities as follows:
 4

Walk in the Shoes of Clients
The Company encourages all employees, regardless of job title, to walk in the shoes of clients by putting a priority on listening to clients’ needs and challenges, doing what they can to make it easy to work with Quad, and making the client experience enjoyable at every touchpoint. In Quad 3.0, the Company is focused on evolving client print-production conversations to conversations encompassing consultative, enterprise-wide solutions that will create more value for clients. To accomplish this, a key component of Quad’s client-facing strategy is to strengthen relationships at higher levels within a client’s organization so the Company can better understand, anticipate and satisfy the organization’s needs. In Quad 3.0, Quad seeks to become an invaluable strategic marketing partner for its clients, helping them successfully navigate today’s constantly evolving media landscape through innovative data-driven solutions, produced and deployed across multiple media channels. The Company also believes its proactive thought leadership in the key issues facing its clients, including data-driven marketing and postal reform, will foster loyalty to the Quad brand.
Grow the Business Profitably
This strategy centers on Quad’s ability to grow its business at a time when significant media disruption and print industry headwinds continue. Key components of this strategy are as follows:

• | Quad 3.0, in which the Company serves as a comprehensive marketing solution partner to its clients. The Company believes its integrated end-to-end marketing solutions platform will create more value than the traditional agency approach that operates in silos and is focused on profit by media channel. Quad’s integrated marketing solutions platform removes the complexity Quad’s clients’ face when working with multiple agency partners, providing a streamlined and simplified approach to help them achieve their marketing goals. In doing so, the Company believes it will increase client efficiencies through workflow re-engineering, content production and process optimization; and improve their client’s overall marketing spend effectiveness through customer insights and analytics, creative services and enhanced personalization leading to more real-time and actionable measurement. 


• | Organic growth, in which the Company leverages knowledge from existing client relationships in key growth vertical industries to develop complementary products and services that help brand owners market more efficiently and effectively across media channels. Quad is also focused on ensuring it has the right talent in the right positions to facilitate strategic marketing conversations with its clients that lead to a better understanding of their needs, developing tailored solutions and growing market share. 


• | Disciplined acquisitions, that take many different forms. For example, the Company intends to continue to pursue value-driven industry consolidating acquisitions as well as acquisitions and investments that help accelerate the Company’s transformation in Quad 3.0, such as the proposed acquisition of LSC. 

Strengthen the Core
Quad uses a disciplined return on capital framework and historically has made significant investments in its print manufacturing platform and data management capabilities that have resulted in what it believes is the most integrated, automated, efficient, innovative and modern manufacturing platform and distribution network in the printing industry. The Company’s continued focus to strengthen its core manufacturing platform through investments that streamline, automate and improve efficiencies and throughput, while reducing labor costs, promotes sustainable cash flow and continued value creation. Further, Quad’s disciplined culture of holistic Continuous Improvement and commitment to Lean Manufacturing methodologies is a high priority throughout the Company and supports its goal of strengthening the production and distribution functions for core product lines so that Quad can remain the printing industry’s high-quality, low-cost producer.

Empower Employees
Quad’s strategy to empower employees throughout their career journey builds on key aspects of the Company’s distinct corporate culture, which the Company uses to fuel its ongoing Quad 3.0 transformation. These aspects include strong and lasting Company values and an organization-wide entrepreneurial spirit and opportunity-seeking mentality. Employees are encouraged to take pride and ownership in their work, take advantage of continuous learning programs to advance in their careers and improve leadership skills, share knowledge by mentoring others and innovate solutions to drive performance. With the encouragement to do things differently, to be something greater and to create a better way, the Company believes its employees are more fully engaged in producing better results for clients and advancing the Company’s strategic goals, while supporting community activities, initiatives and organizations that impact the quality of life near Quad’s facilities. As Quad continues to expand its integrated marketing platform in Quad 3.0, the Company believes this creates possibilities for each employee that are advantageously distinct from other employers.
Enhance Financial Strength and Create Shareholder Value
Quad follows a disciplined approach to maintaining and enhancing financial strength to create shareholder value, which is essential given ongoing media disruption and printing industry challenges. This strategy is centered on the Company’s ability to maximize net earnings, Free Cash Flow and operating margins; maintain consistent financial policies to ensure a strong balance sheet, liquidity level and access to capital; and retain the financial flexibility needed to strategically allocate and deploy capital as circumstances change. The priorities for capital allocation and deployment are adjusted based on prevailing circumstances and what the Company thinks is best for shareholder value creation at any particular point in time. Those priorities currently include the following: (1) deleveraging the Company’s balance sheet through debt and pension liability reductions; (2) making compelling investments that drive profitable organic growth and productivity in the Company’s print manufacturing and distribution operations, as well as executing on acquisitions through a disciplined approach that includes continued expansion into higher-growth marketing services that help accelerate the Company’s transformation in Quad 3.0, and pursuing value-driven industry consolidation; and (3) returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
To provide ongoing improvement in manufacturing productivity, the Company applies holistic Continuous Improvement and Lean Manufacturing methodologies to simplify and streamline processes and to ultimately maximize operating margins. These same methodologies are applied to its selling, general and administrative functions to create a truly Lean Enterprise. The Company has been working diligently to lower its cost structure by consolidating its manufacturing platform into its most efficient facilities, as well as realizing purchasing, mailing and logistics efficiencies by centralizing and consolidating print manufacturing volumes and eliminating redundancies in its administrative and corporate operations. Quad believes that its focused efforts to be the high-quality, low-cost producer generates increased Free Cash Flow and allows the Company to maintain a strong balance sheet through debt and pension liability reductions. The Company’s disciplined financial approach also allows it to maintain sufficient liquidity and to reduce refinancing risk, with the nearest significant debt maturity not occurring until January 2021.
Competitive Advantages
Quad’s strategic priorities are powered by three key competitive advantages that the Company believes distinguishes itself from its competitors: a commitment to ongoing innovation, a commitment to platform excellence, and a commitment to its people and lasting culture.
 6

Commitment to Ongoing Innovation
At the forefront of innovation for more than 47 years, Quad believes its commitment to ongoing innovation drives its purpose to create a better way. To accomplish this, Quad takes a disciplined build-partner-acquire approach:
Build
From integrated marketing solutions and technology to productivity improvements and vertically integrated businesses like healthcare, Quad prides itself on strategically investing in and developing the appropriate expertise internally to increase revenue or reduce costs as follows:
In strategic marketing functions, Quad continues to hire business professionals with client-side marketing experience to help advance conversations with clients to be more consultative or solutions-based in Quad 3.0. To further support its marketing solutions thought leadership, Quad conducts annual quantitative research called Customer Focus®™. This extensive survey, conducted by a third party, provides consumer insight on singular and integrated media usage. The survey reveals the unique characteristics of special demographic, generational, gender and socio-economic groups and how they consume advertising and marketing messaging, and their attitudes and engagement preferences in several industry segments. According to survey data, print remains a strong driver across generations. This active response to print has influenced magazine publishers to increase usage of custom product covers to enhance reader engagement and retailers who primarily use digital channels, such as online-only retailers, to incorporate print into their marketing strategy. Further, Quad can combine the insights from Customer Focus®™ and use its proprietary segmentation tool, called Accelerated Insights®, to leverage client data and create effective hyper-personalized campaigns in both traditional and digital channels. The ability to generate content that is relevant to the consumer is one way the Company believes it can help its clients influence consumer behavior, lift response and enhance return on investment. 
The Company also remains committed to ongoing innovation throughout its print manufacturing and distribution processes to better serve its clients and remain the industry’s high-quality, low-cost producer. Over the last five years, Quad has invested an average of 2.5% of its annual net sales for capital expenditures in its core print manufacturing and distribution platform. This investment has resulted in what the Company believes is the most advanced and efficient print manufacturing and distribution platform in the industry and has allowed the Company to reduce the amount invested in recent years without impacting its leading technological excellence. 
To improve internal processes, enhance client service levels and further drive efficiencies, the Company has consistently focused on the rapid adoption of technological innovations. In the early years, the Company integrated its imaging, manufacturing and distribution networks into a single platform using a networked information technology infrastructure. This platform, connected via Quad’s own Smartools® proprietary enterprise resource planning system, provides seamless, real-time information flow across sales and estimating, production planning, scheduling, manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, invoicing, reporting and customer service. In Quad 3.0, the Company has extended its spirit of innovation with business process management tools that further simplify and improve existing internal workflows. This includes pricing, job specifications and client acceptance to streamlining and automating the hand-offs between departments throughout the entire order workflow through invoicing. Quad also has applied robotic process automation to streamline data processing and report generation. This allows employees to focus on value-adding tasks, while the robotic process completes the transactional, repetitive functions. Where appropriate, Quad also leverages artificial intelligence in areas such as labor management, scheduling and predictive machine maintenance.
A commitment to innovation and creating a better way to do business has also helped to expand Quad’s vertically-integrated non-print capabilities, such as data management, imaging, logistics and distribution, ink manufacturing (Chemical Research\Technology), paper procurement, and equipment research and design. This approach to business gives the Company a competitive advantage in delivering lower costs for its clients, enhancing customer service levels and allowing substantial control over critical links in the overall print supply chain to help it control the quality, cost and availability of key inputs in the printing process. In addition, QuadMed, LLC (“QuadMed”), the Company’s health and wellness subsidiary, was founded in 1990 to create a better way to address the Company’s own employees’ needs for quality, cost-effective healthcare. Today, QuadMed provides employer-sponsored healthcare 
 7

solutions on a national level to employers of all sizes, including private and public sector companies. These solutions include, but are not limited to, on-site and near-site healthcare clinics, occupational health services, telemedicine, and health and wellness programs.
Partner
In addition to building capabilities internally, Quad fosters innovation by partnering with companies whose expertise helps fill a specific gap or amplify an existing offering. For example, to strengthen its integrated marketing solutions platform, Quad established a partnership with Rise Interactive Media & Analytics, LLC (“Rise”), a digital marketing agency specializing in media, analytics and customer experience, and as of March 2018, owns a controlling interest in this company. The partnership brings together Quad’s expertise in optimizing a client’s marketing spend in traditional channels with Rise’s expertise in digital channels. The Company believes this creates more integrated, multi-channel campaigns and, ultimately, advances data-driven marketing through the delivery of highly relevant, consistent messages, at scale, to consumers. 
Acquire
When the Company wants to drive innovation by filling multiple gaps in its integrated marketing solutions platform to quickly scale, acquire talent and/or accelerate its transformation, the Company acquires the targeted company if the opportunity meets Quad’s disciplined acquisition criteria. For example, on February 21, 2018, the Company acquired Ivie & Associates (“Ivie”), a premier marketing services provider specializing in customized marketing and business process outsourcing to provide clients with unmatched scale for on-site marketing services, integrated execution, and expanded subject matter expertise in digital, media and creative. 
On January 3, 2019, the Company acquired Periscope, Inc. (“Periscope”), one of the nation’s top five independent creative agencies by annual revenue, offering world-class capabilities in strategy, including media buying and analytics, creative and account management, as well as packaging design and premedia services. The acquisition supports and accelerates the Company’s ongoing Quad 3.0 transformation, creating a highly efficient global platform for creating marketing campaigns and programs — from strategy and creative through execution — across all media channels. 
Additionally, on October 30, 2018, the Company and LSC entered into a definitive agreement, pursuant to which Quad will acquire LSC in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $1.3 billion, including the refinancing of LSC’s debt and assumption of other obligations. The Company expects to complete the acquisition in mid-2019, following the completion of customary closing conditions including regulatory approval and approval by the shareholders of both companies. Together with LSC, the Company will enhance its highly efficient print platform with a compelling combination of talent, expertise and client technology. This will further fuel the Quad 3.0 transformation and strengthen the role of print in today’s multichannel world.
Commitment to Platform Excellence
Platform excellence pertains to Quad’s integrated Manufacturing, Mailing and Distribution, and Marketing platforms that support Quad 3.0 as follows:
 8

Manufacturing Platform
Quad continues to invest in equipment and leading-edge technology to ensure its manufacturing platform remains the strongest and most sustainable in the printing industry and that it continues to support a vast range of traditional and digital print solutions, finishing techniques and distribution capabilities to create value for its clients in Quad 3.0. At the same time, the Company has continued to strengthen its platform by removing excess, under-utilized capacity and by consolidating work into facilities where it can achieve the greatest manufacturing and distribution efficiencies. Over the past eight years, the Company has closed 43 manufacturing plants representing nearly 13.4 million square feet of under-utilized production capacity. This commitment to consolidating work into fewer facilities to maximize capacity is one key way Quad maintains platform excellence and remains the industry’s high-quality, low-cost producer.
The Company has continuously invested in its print manufacturing platform through state-of-the-art equipment and automation that reduces labor costs, maximizes labor productivity and increases throughput. Within the last 5 years, these investments include multiple wide-web offset presses and digital presses; more than 50 automated guided vehicles or computer-controlled robotic forklifts; and more than 40 automated palletizers, which automatically configure bundles of finished magazines and catalogs on pallets at the end of a binding line.
The Company’s investment in its manufacturing platform has consistently been based on evaluating the economic useful life of the underlying equipment rather than focusing on the potential mechanical life of the equipment. This discipline is critical in an industry in which technological change can create obsolescence well before the end of the mechanical life of equipment. To remain the industry’s high-quality, low-cost producer, Quad makes a concerted effort to treat all costs as variable and maintains a stringent focus on achieving productivity improvements and sustainable cost reductions through a variety of holistic Continuous Improvement and Lean Enterprise programs in both manufacturing and administrative areas.
Another key aspect of the Company’s modern manufacturing platform is the combination of its footprint of mega plants (facilities greater than one million square feet) that produce several different products under one roof; mega zones where multiple facilities in close geographic proximity are managed as one large facility; and smaller strategically located facilities. The Company has continued to evolve its platform by equipping facilities to be product line agnostic, which enables the Company to maximize equipment utilization. Quad believes that the large plant size of certain of its key printing facilities allows the Company to drive savings in certain product lines (such as publications and catalogs) due to economies of scale and from investments in automation and technology. 
The Company continues to transform its manufacturing platform from conventional web offset presses to modern digital presses that will give marketers and publishers a full range of options to produce and deliver relevant direct mail, books, packaging and other commercial products faster and more cost-effectively:

• | The Company has invested in its technology-enabled direct mail platform to provide innovative front-end toolsets and data workflows; industry-best back-end logistics and postal optimization; and a diverse production platform that is highly leveraged on personalization technologies serving the needs of today’s leading marketers. Personalization and targeting create the opportunity to reach the right recipients with a relevant message at the right time which, in turn, helps its clients increase consumer response rates, maximize their return on print spending and reduce overall costs. Built over many years, Quad’s data-driven, one-to-one direct marketing platform includes in-house capabilities to analyze mailing list data, demographic data, consumer transaction data and other consumer-specific data to help its clients create targeted and personalized printed materials. 


• | The Company also continues to transform its book platform through the rapid implementation of digital press technology and integrated systems, and the creation of On-Q™, a proprietary demand-driven ordering system that helps clients better manage ordering and inventory. Quad is helping book publishers with increased customization and versioning capabilities; faster time-to-market; reduced waste, inventories and obsolescence; and lower fixed costs. 

 9


• | Recent investments in digital press technology in the Company’s high-end folding carton packaging business has enabled it to enter markets in which it previously was not as competitive, such as private label packaging. With its digital press platform, Quad is able to cost-competitively accommodate shorter runs with quicker turns. 

Mailing and Distribution Platform
Quad is also able to leverage the volume of products running through its plants for further client distribution savings by coordinating and consolidating shipments from single mega plants or multiple plants that create a mega zone, and then routing those shipments directly to thousands of local newspapers, United States Postal Service (“USPS”) processing facilities or other distribution facilities. In addition, each major United States metropolitan area is within one day’s drive of at least one of the Company’s strategically located facilities, providing its clients the flexibility to print closest to their end consumers.
Postal rates are a significant component of many clients’ cost structures, and Quad believes that postal costs influence the number of pieces that its clients print and mail. Therefore, the Company has invested significantly in its mailing and distribution platform to mitigate increasing postage costs, and to help clients successfully navigate the ever-changing postal environment. The Company performs an analysis of mail list data as part of its logistics services, which allows it to reduce client freight costs for shipments to newsstands and postal centers, while providing a high level of dependability and rapid response times that are crucial to the delivery of time-sensitive materials. Further, the Company manages mail distribution of most of its clients’ products to maximize efficiency and reduce these costs, and its co-mail program is the largest in the print industry, based on information published by or otherwise made available from competitors. Quad’s co-mail program involves the sorting and bundling of printed products to be mailed to consumers, in order to facilitate better integration with the USPS. In return, the USPS offers significant work-sharing discounts for this sorting, bundling and drop-shipping. Quad co-mailed approximately 3.7 billion publications, catalogs and direct marketing pieces in 2018. Due to the continuously increasing costs of utilizing the USPS and to help control costs for its clients, Quad launched and is expanding a pilot project revolving around alternate delivery strategies for clients’ products that result in Quad managing delivery directly to the consumer and bypassing the USPS as a delivery method. 
Marketing Platform
In Quad 3.0, the Company’s commitment to platform excellence extends to integrated marketing solutions, specifically as it relates to the services provided at client on-sites. With the acquisition of Ivie, Quad now has more 1,200 professionals dedicated to content creation and marketing execution at more than 60 client on-sites, including retail and publishing. For clients who engage the Company’s on-site marketing solutions model, Quad employees serve as a natural extension of a client’s internal marketing department and fulfill traditional agency executional roles while also providing production efficiencies at scale. The Company believes this model increases process efficiencies and enables clients to focus on what they do best: sell more products, services and content. 
Commitment to People and Lasting Culture
Quad believes that its employees do not just make a difference—they are the difference. The Company believes this is a key competitive advantage that is not easily replicated by its competitors given its long-standing culture.
Quad believes that its distinct corporate culture, which evolved from a core set of values conceived by the late founder Harry V. Quadracci, drives thoughtful decision-making, especially with regard to its disciplined approach to managing operations, creating solutions that redefine print in a multichannel media marketplace, and better positioning the Company to prevail in the dynamic and competitive printing industry. The Company fosters an entrepreneurial environment by inspiring and empowering employees to own projects and enact solutions that advance the Company’s goals. Employees in the United States also may have a beneficial ownership interest in Quad through Company stock held in the Quad/Graphics, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”), enhancing their sense of ownership. The Company believes this sense of employee engagement and distinct corporate culture drives its disciplined approach to all aspects of its business.
 10

The Company demonstrates its commitment to employee engagement in a variety of ways, including the following:

• | Offering employees a competitive compensation and benefits package;


• | Providing employees with a safe work environment with robust safety training and accountability programs;


• | Offering continuous learning and career advancement opportunities, such as through registered mechanical and electrical apprenticeship programs, youth apprenticeship programs, the Company’s own Accelerated Career Training program for production employees, digital media training, affinity groups and leadership development training;


• | Promoting employee health and wellness through a variety of personal improvement programs and facilities, including the Company’s own QuadMed primary care clinics;


• | Acting on employee feedback garnered through regular surveys and open forums at department and company-wide meetings;


• | Offering an employee referral program and investing in technology and improved processes to facilitate an easy hiring and on-boarding process; and


• | Fostering pride through employee recognition programs, employee and family events, community outreach activities and support, a history of environmental commitments, such as effective management of resources and reducing waste, and adhering to a published code of ethics.

Quad is led by an experienced management team with a proven track record in the printing industry that is committed to preserving the Company’s values-based culture. The senior management team includes entrepreneurially minded leaders with a long tenure at Quad mixed with strategic new hires or leaders from recent acquisitions, further supplemented by managers and employees committed to advancing print and marketing solutions in coordination with the ever-evolving multichannel media landscape. The Company believes the experience and stability of senior management, paired with next-generation talent, will contribute to its long-term success as it continues its path forward in Quad 3.0.
Quad also enjoys a competitive advantage in consistent, stable leadership that is focused on making decisions in the best long-term interest of the Company. It is able to do this because of the Quadracci family voting control, which enables the Company to manage its strategy and disciplined financial policy by being able to make decisions today that could benefit the Company years from now and avoid the pitfalls of short-term decision making that could potentially jeopardize the stability and longevity of the Company.
Environmental Stewardship
Quad strives to be the leader in the printing industry in adopting new technologies and processes to minimize the Company’s impact on the environment. The Company believes it has long been known for its environmental stewardship. Quad’s proactive approach to incorporate holistic practices has also positively impacted operating costs through the reduction of waste, energy use, and emissions, as well as through the implementation of water conservation solutions. The Company has also undertaken steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its manufacturing processes and to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions in its fleet of Company-owned tractor trailers.
 11

As the owner, lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities, Quad is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions; waste generation, handling, management and disposal; sanitary and storm water discharge; and remediation of contaminated sites. Historically, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations may require the Company to make future expenditures.
Clients
Quad enjoys long-standing relationships with a diverse base of clients, which includes both national and regional corporations in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. The Company’s clients include industry-leading blue chip companies that operate in a wide range of industries and serve both businesses and consumers, including retailers, publishers and direct marketers. The Company’s relationships with its largest clients average over 20 years in duration.
In 2018, Quad served approximately 6,100 clients, and its ten largest clients accounted for approximately 15% of consolidated sales, with none representing more than 5% individually. The Company believes that its large and diverse client base, broad geographic coverage and extensive range of printing and print-related capabilities are competitive strengths.

Quad operates research and development facilities that support the development of new equipment, process improvements, raw materials and content management, and distribution technologies to better meet client needs and improve operating efficiencies. The Company continues to innovate within the printing and print-related industry and, as a result, has developed what it believes to be one of the most powerful patent portfolios in the print industry.
Quad currently holds or has rights to commercialize a wide variety of worldwide patents and applications relating to its business. The Company intends to continue to file patent applications that it believes will help ensure the continued strength of the Company and its portfolio. Additionally, the Company markets products, services and capabilities under a number of trademarks and trade names. Quad aggressively defends its intellectual property rights and intends to continue to do so in the future.
Raw Materials
The primary raw materials that Quad uses in its print business are paper, ink and energy. At this time, the Company’s supply of raw materials is readily available from numerous vendors; however, based on market conditions, that could change in the future. The Company generally buys these raw materials based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the procurement process.
Approximately half of the paper used by the Company is supplied directly by its clients. For those clients that do not directly supply their own paper, the Company makes use of its purchasing efficiencies to supply paper by negotiating with leading paper vendors, uses a wide variety of paper grades, weights and sizes, and does not rely on any one vendor. In addition, the Company generally includes price adjustment clauses in sales contracts for paper and other critical raw materials in the printing process. Although these clauses generally mitigate paper price risk, higher paper prices and tight paper supplies may have an impact on client demand for printed products. The Company’s working capital requirements, including the impact of seasonality, are partially mitigated through the direct purchasing of paper by its clients.
The Company produces the majority of ink used in its print production, allowing it to control the quality, cost and supply of key inputs. Raw materials for the ink manufacturing process are purchased externally from a variety of vendors.

The Company generally cannot pass on to clients the impact of higher electric and natural gas energy prices on its manufacturing costs, and increases in energy prices result in higher manufacturing costs for certain of its operations. The Company mitigates its risk through natural gas hedges when appropriate. In its logistic operations, however, the Company is able to pass a substantial portion of any increase in fuel prices directly to its clients.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, Quad had approximately 20,600 full-time equivalent employees in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Within the United States, there were approximately 16,900 full-time equivalent employees, of which approximately 400 were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Outside of the United States, there were approximately 3,700 full-time equivalent employees, of which approximately 1,200 were either governed by an industry-wide agreement, by a collective bargaining agreement or through a works council or similar arrangement. Quad believes that its employee relations are good and that the Company maintains an employee-centric culture.
