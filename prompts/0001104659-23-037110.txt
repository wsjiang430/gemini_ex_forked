Item 1.BUSINESS
Overview
We are a deep-sea minerals exploration company focused on the collection, processing and refining of polymetallic nodules found on the seafloor in international waters of the Clarion Clipperton Zone (“CCZ”), about 1,300 nautical miles (1,500 miles or 2,400 kilometers) south-west of San Diego, California. The CCZ is a geological submarine fracture zone of abyssal plains and other formations in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, with a length of around 7,240 km (4,500 miles) that spans approximately 4,500,000 square kilometers (1,700,000 square miles). Polymetallic nodules are discrete rocks that sit unattached to the seafloor, occur in significant quantities in the CCZ and have high concentrations of nickel, manganese, cobalt and copper in a single rock.
These four metals contained in the polymetallic nodules are critical for the transition to low carbon energy. Our resource definition work to date shows that nodules in our contract areas represent the world’s largest estimated undeveloped source of critical battery metals. If we are able to collect polymetallic nodules from the seafloor on a commercial scale, we plan to use such nodules to produce three types of metal products: (i) feedstock for battery cathode precursors (nickel and cobalt sulfates) for electric vehicles (“EV”) and renewable energy storage markets, (ii) copper cathode for EV wiring, clean energy transmission and other applications, and (iii) manganese silicate for manganese alloy production required for steel production. Our mission is to build a carefully managed, shared stock of metal (a “metal commons”) that can be used, recovered and reused for generations to come. Significant quantities of newly mined metal are required because existing metal stocks are insufficient to meet rapidly rising demand.
Exploration and exploitation of seabed minerals in international waters is regulated by the International Seabed Authority (“ISA”), an intergovernmental organization established pursuant to the 1994 Agreement Relating to the Implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (“UNCLOS”). The ISA grants contracts to sovereign states or to private contractors who are sponsored by a sovereign state. The ISA requires that a contractor obtain and maintain sponsorship by a host nation that is a member of the ISA and signatory to UNCLOS, and such nation maintains effective supervision and regulatory control over such sponsored contractor. The ISA has issued a total of 19 polymetallic nodule exploration contracts covering approximately 1.28 million km2, or 0.4% of the global seafloor, 17 of which are in the CCZ. We hold exclusive exploration and commercial rights to three of the 17 polymetallic nodule contract areas in the CCZ through our subsidiaries Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (“NORI”) and Tonga Offshore Mining Limited (“TOML”), sponsored by the Republic of Nauru (“Nauru”) and the Kingdom of Tonga (“Tonga”), respectively, and exclusive commercial rights through our subsidiary, DeepGreen Engineering Pte. Ltd.’s (“DGE”), arrangement with Marawa Research and Exploration Limited (“Marawa”), a company owned and sponsored by the Republic of Kiribati (“Kiribati”).
We are still in the exploration phase and have not yet obtained any exploitation contracts from the ISA, which will only be available after exploitation regulations have been established, to commence commercial scale polymetallic nodule collection in the CCZ nor do we have the applicable environmental and other permits required to build and operate commercial-scale polymetallic nodule processing and refining plants on land.

Polymetallic Nodules
Deep-sea polymetallic nodules form on or just below the sediment-covered seafloor of the abyssal plains. These nodules contain significant amounts of metals, and their unique characteristic compared to terrestrial deposits is the presence of four critical metals in one deposit.

Additionally, polymetallic nodules in the CCZ possess the following characteristics:
​

Characteristic | ​ | What it means 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Far removed from human communities | ​ | No need for social displacement 
No vegetation or other obstructions covering access to nodules | ​ | No need to remove overburden, no rock cutting or blasting 
Unbound to the seafloor, 90% of nodule mass in the top 5 cm of seafloor | ​ | No need for destructive rock cutting and excavation 
High grades of four critical metals in a single ore | ​ | Less mass to process compared to land ores 
Low head-grade variability | ​ | Potentially easy to process 
2-10 cm diameter | ​ | Potentially easy to handle 
Microporous | ​ | Potentially easy to smelt 
Very low concentrations of hazardous elements like arsenic, antimony and mercury | ​ | Potential to productize 100% of nodule mass and design a metallurgical flowsheet that generates no tailings and leaves almost no solid waste streams behind

​
The above characteristics of polymetallic nodules may provide an opportunity to compress lifecycle environmental and social impacts of producing critical metals as compared to land ores. In order to extract nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese from land ores, at least three different types of ores would need to be excavated. Mine development often involves social displacement and impacts on Indigenous people as well as deforestation, destruction of carbon sinks and biodiversity loss. In addition, several times more mass would need to be processed, often requiring significant amounts of local water resources; mining and processing tailings which can be toxic and need to be managed indefinitely in tailings dams, using dry-stacking or a practice known as deep-sea tailings placement (DSTP). Furthermore, metal production from land ores can release several toxic streams into the surrounding environment which can negatively impact the health of local communities and ecosystems. We believe using nodules to produce critical metals can help reduce several of these impacts associated with mining land ores. If our nodules are to be processed and refined in the United States (“U.S.”), we can also compress the current supply chain that some materials need to travel before reaching the U.S. of 50,000 miles down to 1,500 miles, while reducing dependency on China which dominates refining for battery metals such as nickel, cobalt and manganese.
Market Opportunity
A 2021 study by the International Energy Agency shows that the production of energy transition minerals could increase by 600% by 2040 to meet the growing demand for low-carbon energy technologies required to keep global warming at 1.5°C. Given the wide range of environmental and social impacts associated with conventional land-based mining, we believe it is important to ensure that these large amounts of critical metals are sourced with the lowest environmental, social, and economic impacts possible. As the global supply of high-grade ore remains limited and metal demand increases, we can expect a larger environmental and social footprint, potential supply shortages and sustained increases in metal prices should land-based ores remain the only viable source of critical metals.
​

Industries which represent an end-use segment that may require all four critical metals contained in nodules are of particular interest to us and represent potential market opportunities. Most notably, nodules contain metals that can be employed as: (i) feedstock for battery cathode precursors (nickel and cobalt sulfates) for EV and renewable energy storage markets, (ii) copper cathode for EV wiring, clean energy transmission and other applications, and (iii) manganese silicate for manganese alloy production required for steel production. See Section – Competitive Strengths.

​
Battery Metals and EV Market Opportunity - Global
We believe there will be significant growth in EV demand, with many countries committing to phasing out cars that burn fossil fuels and many original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) devoting significant resources to the electrification of their vehicle offerings. In 2022, the number of signatories to the Zero Emission Vehicle declaration announced at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in October 2021 increased to 214; the declaration is aimed at accelerating the transition to zero emission vehicles with a goal to reach 100% new EV car and van sales by 2040, and by 2035 in leading markets. Following the development of an energy crisis spurred by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Parliament approved a law requiring that all new passenger cars and vans produce zero emissions by 2035, effectively banning the sale of new gas- and diesel-powered vehicles in the future (although a last-minute opposition from Germany in March 2023 has delayed the final vote on this law and may have put the laws’ future in doubt). . The law also increases carbon dioxide emission reduction targets for new cars to 55% for 2030 compared to 37.5% for 2021. Similarly in the U.S., 22 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have set 100% decarbonized energy goals by 2050 or sooner, with the Biden administration seeking to make half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. zero-emissions vehicles by 2030. We believe this

transition to low carbon energy and EVs will test the limits of the current supply of certain metals, as EVs require several times more of these metals (such as nickel, cobalt and copper) than cars with internal combustion engines. Raw material shortages could potentially delay the achievement of the world’s energy transition goals.

Battery Metals and EV Market Opportunity - USA
In August 2021, the U.S. government announced a target of 50% EV sales by 2030. The announcement was followed by a ramp-up of industry commitments to build battery cell manufacturing gigafactories, which when aggregated across North America would represent approximately 1,047GWh of capacity, according to Benchmark Minerals Intelligence (“Benchmark”).
In June 2021, the Biden administration’s 100-Day Review of Critical Minerals Supply Chains estimated that fully electrifying U.S. car sales would require 1,273ktpa of Class 1 nickel, 160ktpa of cobalt and 148ktpa of manganese, compared with existing U.S. primary production of 18ktpa of nickel, 0.6ktpa of cobalt, and zero primary production of manganese. Across our NORI and TOML contract areas, we have identified 15.9Mt of nickel, 2.3Mt of cobalt and 355Mt of manganese plus 13.5Mt of copper, with the potential to take the U.S. from zero or de minimis production of the three namesake elements in the most prominent battery cathode (NMC) to near self-sufficiency or potentially a net export position in each. Senator Lisa Murkowski wrote a letter to the U.S. Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, which noted “new and abundant sources of supply, such as polymetallic nodules, offer a pathway to mineral security for the United States.” The U.S. Secretary of Energy’s reply in July 2022 included, “In light of global demand for critical minerals, it is reasonable to expect that exploitation of marine resources will at some point occur. Department of Energy is continuing to work with interagency partners to consider all potential sources of critical minerals for the supply chain including the role that seabed nodules could play in the future.” 
Environmental Market Opportunity
All nickel, cobalt, copper and manganese going into EVs today are produced from land-based ores or recycled metal stock. Existing metal stocks available for recycling are insufficient to meet current demand. Even with high end-of-life product recycling rates, most of the new demand over the coming decades will have to be met by new mining. We believe the land mining sector is fundamentally challenged — ore grades are falling, production is moving to some of the more biodiverse and conflict-laden regions in the world (such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia, Philippines and South Africa), accessing ore bodies often requires a complete removal of ecosystems situated on and above such orebodies, and removing, breaking or tunneling through significant tonnage of waste rock. Toxic levels of heavy elements often found in land orebodies typically need to be removed, stored, and maintained indefinitely — a real challenge on seismically active and wet tropical islands in countries like Indonesia that accounts for most of the growth in nickel supply.

As a result of a vigorous campaign by several non-governmental organizations, some participants in the EV supply chain have called for a general moratorium on all forms of deep seabed mining until there is more knowledge about marine impacts of nodule collection operations. While our Environmental & Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for offshore nodule collection segment of the NORI Area D Nodule Project is still ongoing, based on already completed research into lifecycle impacts of battery metal production specifically from deep-sea polymetallic nodules, we believe that nodules provide an opportunity to significantly compress most lifecycle environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts associated with conventional metal production from land-based ores.
​
​

10



To quantify comparative ESG footprints of metal production from nodules as compared to conventional land ores, we commissioned several lifecycle assessments (“LCAs”) looking at the cradle-to-gate impacts of producing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese products from polymetallic nodules and how it compares to land-based routes. An LCA white paper examining a comprehensive set of impacts was commissioned by us and co-authored by certain of our executive officers in 2018 and reviewed by subject matter specialists and published on our website in April 2020; an LCA research paper focusing on climate change impacts was peer-reviewed and published in the Elsevier Journal of Cleaner Production in December 2020, an LCA research paper focusing on solid waste streams was peer-reviewed and published in the Yale Journal of Industrial Ecology in January 2022 and an LCA compliant with the International Organization for Standardization Standard 14040 on our NORI Area D project was conducted by Benchmark and released in March 2023. Based on these LCA assessments that we commissioned and certain of our executive officers co-authored, we believe that we are positioned to become one of the lowest ESG footprint metal companies in the industry. The March 2023 LCA by Benchmark shows that the NORI Area D project performed better in each impact category analyzed than all the land-based processing routes chosen for comparison, except for the global warming potential (“GWP”) and water consumption of producing cobalt sulfate, in which one land-based route performed better. While most of these reductions are attributable to the unique characteristics of the polymetallic nodule resource as described above, the elimination of solid processing waste streams onshore is due to our investment in a near-zero-waste flowsheet design and low carbon emissions are due to our commitment to locate onshore processing facilities in places with access to renewable power.
​
​
Benchmark modeled the land-based processing routes with background ecoinvent data and foreground data from two expert chemical engineers in the nickel and cobalt industry. The NORI Area D Project data is based on the NORI Technical Report Summary, dated March 2021, which included an initial assessment and an economic analysis of NORI Area D prepared in accordance with the SEC’s Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants set forth in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (the “SEC Mining Rules”). The NORI Technical Report Summary is filed as Exhibit 96.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
The Benchmark LCA is currently assessing the impacts of the NORI Area D Project on marine biodiversity and ecosystem function as part of the ESIA conducted by NORI in partnership with world leading deep sea research institutions and contractors. The CCZ abyssal plains are one of the most common and least populated habitats on the planet, akin to barren deserts on land. The CCZ abyssal seafloor is plant-free, food-poor and dominated by bacterial life forms. It has been studied extensively since the 1960s with over 150,000 papers published on polymetallic nodules in general and over 40,000 on CCZ nodules in particular. 

11



The largest driver of uncertainty in assessing the potential future impact of nodule collection operations on marine biodiversity is our ability to measure biodiversity itself. Unlike biodiversity, biomass, measured as carbon contained in live organisms per m2 of habitat, is easier to measure and compare. Based on available data we have reviewed, we believe that the CCZ is one of lowest biomass places on the planet. Metal production from nodules will reduce biomass at risk by over 90% compared to producing the same amount of metals from conventional land ores. 
​
​
As a precautionary environmental management and protection measure, the ISA has already set aside 43% of the CCZ as protected areas or 1.97 million km2, or Areas of Particular Environmental Interest (APEIs) aiming to ensure that all types of habitats that could be impacted by exploitation are represented within APEIs. For comparison, only approximately 7% of global oceans are protected today and the global target agreed in the High Seas Treaty in March 2023 is to protect 30% of the oceans by 2030. Additional marine impact mitigation measures such as setting aside more no-take areas inside our contract areas and leaving partial nodule cover inside collection areas to aid natural recovery of bacterial and other communities are also being evaluated. We are collaborating with some of the world’s leading researchers to conduct environmental baseline and collection impact studies to design plans that could mitigate marine impacts of nodule collection through collection system design and adaptive management systems.

12



If the entire CCZ area currently under exploration (1.28 million km2) were to be exploited over a 30-year period, these nodule collection operations would impact 42,500 km2 of the abyssal seafloor per year in one of the least productive areas of the ocean (with respect to the abundance of marine life). This is less than 1% of the estimated 4,900,000 km2 of the seafloor currently impacted every year by trawling operations that take place primarily in highly productive coastal waters.
​
​
Potential future commercial-scale nodule collection operations in the CCZ are likely to disturb marine wildlife in the operating area. The nature and severity of these impacts on CCZ wildlife are expected to vary by species and are currently subject to uncertainty. We have completed studies baselining wildlife and ecosystem function, piloting the nodule collection system and assessing impacts arising from the use of this system, and collected data processing and assessment are currently in progress. Given the significant volume of deep water and the difficulty of sampling or retrieving biological specimens in the CCZ, a complete biological inventory might never be established. Accordingly, impacts on CCZ biodiversity may never be completely and definitively known. For the same reasons, it may also not be possible to definitively establish whether the impact of nodule collection on global biodiversity will be less significant than those estimated for land-based mining for a similar amount of produced metal.
It is also currently not definitively known how effectively the risk of biodiversity loss in the CCZ could be eliminated or reduced through mitigation strategies or how long it will take for disturbed seabed areas to recover naturally. Prior research indicates that the density, diversity and function of fauna representing most of the resident biomass (including mobile, pelagic and microbial life) are expected to recover naturally over years to decades. However, a high level of uncertainty exists around recovery of fauna that requires the hard substrate of nodules for critical life function. The extent to which planned measures such as leaving behind partial nodule cover and setting aside no-take areas would aid recruitment and recovery of nodule-dependent species in impacted areas will depend on factors like habitat connectivity, which is an area that is still under study.
We are still in the exploration phase of the project and do not have the exploitation contracts necessary to commence commercial-scale nodule collection operations in the CCZ nor have we obtained the applicable environmental and other permits required to build and operate commercial scale polymetallic nodule processing and refining plants on land.

All extractive industries result in impacts to the receiving environment. Nodule collection is no exception and will impact the deep-sea marine environment through nodule removal, disturbance of seafloor sediment (“seafloor plumes”) and return of seawater used for nodule transport that is expected to contain residual sediment and nodule fines back in the water column (“midwater plumes”). Baselining the impacted marine environment by characterizing the ecosystem and then developing measures to avoid and mitigate these impacts is the central focus of our ESIA program currently being undertaken in partnership with some of the world’s leading deep-sea research institutions. Nodule removal will impact species that depend on the hard nodule substrate for attachment. The severity of the impact will depend on (1) the extent to which these species are represented in the APEIs set aside by the ISA and additional no-take areas set aside by us and (2) the extent to which residual nodule cover will aid recruitment and recovery of these species in impacted areas. Disturbance of the seafloor by nodule collector vehicles is expected to disturb (mostly microbial) organisms living in and on the sediments. Impact severity will depend on the depth of sediment disturbance (expected to be approximately 5 cm based on modelling, lab tests, and recent collector tests completed in the CCZ by our subsidiary NORI and two other nodule contract-holders, Belgium’s Global Sea Mineral Resources NV (GSR) and the German’s BGR) and the impact this disturbance has on benthic ecosystem function. Over 90% of the entrained sediment is expected to be separated from nodules inside the collector vehicle and discharged behind the collector vehicle, most settling back to the seafloor within a few hundred meters. The impact of the residual plume will depend on how quickly the smaller mobile sediment particles re-settle, how far they travel and how the resulting sedimentation impacts the benthic organisms. Less than 10% of entrained sediment that will likely evade separation inside the collector vehicle will be transported with nodules and seawater through the riser pipe to the surface production vessel where nodules get dewatered and residual water, sediment and nodules fines will be returned at some depth in the water column below the highly populated and productive photic zone. Potential impacts from the mid-water sediment plume could include clogging of the delicate respiratory and filter feeding structures of pelagic zooplankton species, such as jellyfish and krill. However, the mid-water discharge is expected to have very low solid particle concentration and dilute to low levels within minutes. The depth of discharge will be selected based on ESIA results to minimize impact on life in the midwater column. According to a research paper on midwater sediment plumes published by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”) in Communications Earth & Environment in July 2021, entrained sediment from the return of seawater used for nodule transport dilutes to natural background levels within a few hundred meters of the outlet. Another research paper on seafloor sediment plumes published by MIT and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in September 2022 found that 92-98% of benthic plume generated from the pilot nodule collector vehicle rose only two meters above the seafloor.
Our Strategic Positioning
We believe we are well positioned to meet the growing demand for critical battery metals:

● | Increasing demand: The response to the climate change crisis is accelerating demand for EVs, renewable energy storage and infrastructure. To manufacture battery cells, gigafactories will need critical battery metals like nickel, cobalt, manganese, and copper to meet rising battery demand. The U.S. government maintained its target of 50% EV sales by 2030, spurring a ramp-up of battery gigafactory commitments, as well as the launch of Strategic Priorities for Ocean Exploration and Characterization of the US Exclusive Economic Zone, outlining Federal priorities for ocean exploration and characterization of critical minerals in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean. Globally, the number of signatories to the Zero Emission Vehicle declaration announced at COP26 in October 2021 increased to 214, which is aimed at accelerating the transition to 100% new car sales being zero emission globally by 2040, and by 2035 in leading markets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supporting energy security: In March 2022, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and doubling of nickel pricing to all-time highs in 2022 and 2023 resulted in closing of the LME nickel market. These events illustrated the volatility and vulnerability of international commodity markets, particularly for Class 1 nickel for which Russia is the world’s largest single producer. These events underscore a national security rationale for reducing the dependence on fossil fuels that is complicated by the stronghold position that Russia and China have as major miners and refiners of key clean energy metals. Our NORI and TOML contract areas contain amounts of these metals that rival today’s largest producers, ranked as the world’s #1 and #2 largest undeveloped nickel projects, respectively, by Mining.com in March 2022.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supporting climate justice: At the UN Climate Change Conference (COP27) in November 2022, a “loss and damage” fund was initiated, which aims to establish a long-overdue avenue to deliver vital support to vulnerable, developing countries disproportionately impacted by the accelerating climate crisis. This aligns with the direction of the ISA’s Capacity Development Strategy designed to ensure the effective participation of developing countries.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Rising battery metal and battery cell prices: Commodity prices for metals like nickel and copper have recently reached multi-year highs and battery cell production costs are rising for the first time since the introduction of gigafactories in 2014. Since then, only Chinese battery manufacturers appear to have succeeded at returning to the previous trend of reducing battery costs. We believe that bringing new, strategically located metal sources online may help alleviate the cost pressures on battery cell production.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Advantages 
With the potential that our resources hold and the project advancements we have made to date, we believe we are better positioned than other suppliers to provide a solution to the growing need for critical battery metals:

● | Availability of abundant and high-grade resource off the U.S. western seaboard: There are four critical battery metals (nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese) in relatively high concentrations in polymetallic nodules and we believe our contract areas have estimated in situ quantities of these metals in quantities equivalent to the requirement for 280 million EVs, roughly the size of the entire U.S. passenger vehicle fleet on the road today.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunity for battery metal production in the U.S.: The current supply chain of battery materials to the U.S. is approximately 50,000 miles long and is predominantly controlled by nations and companies outside of the U.S., which is leading to increasing concerns about supply chain security in the U.S. and interest in breaking the U.S. mineral dependence by re-shoring battery material supply chain in the U.S. Our resource is 1,500 miles from San Diego and we believe we can eventually process and refine our polymetallic nodules in the U.S. which could potentially decrease the supply chain in the U.S. to 1,500 miles.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunity to reuse existing assets and skills: We believe there is an opportunity for us to partner with offshore service providers with deep operational experience in subsea environments gained in the oil and gas industry and with existing assets that can be repurposed for our offshore operations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Demonstrated offshore technology: In November 2022, NORI and Allseas completed the Pilot Mining Test where approximately 4,500 tonnes of wet nodules were collected and more than 3,000 tonnes of wet nodules were lifted 4.3km to the surface after traversing over 80km of the seafloor in the NORI Area D, achieving a production rate of 86.4 tonnes per hour with a scaled-down prototype seafloor nodule collector vehicle.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Demonstrated onshore technology: In 2021, we successfully completed calcining and smelting of nodules into a manganese silicate product and nickel-copper-cobalt alloy intermediate, followed by conversion and sulfidation of the alloy into matte. Testwork on the matte to define conditions for the hydrometallurgical refinery has been successfully conducted on several process stages and we anticipate completion of the program in 2023.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lower expected production cost: At our potential steady state production (expected to be approximately 12.5Mtpa of wet nodules from 2030 to 2045), we expect to be the second lowest cost nickel producer in the world, when reflecting the value of our byproducts).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lower expected environmental, social and governance footprint: The LCA completed by Benchmark in March 2023 shows that the NORI Area D project performed better in most impact categories analyzed than all the land-based routes chosen for comparison. We are developing a new type of high-grade multi-metal source found on the abyssal plain - a low biomass, low carbon sequestration deep-sea environment removed from human settlement.

Exploration Contracts
We currently hold exclusive exploration rights through our subsidiaries in NORI and TOML and exclusive commercial rights through agreement with Marawa, to certain polymetallic nodule areas in the CCZ.

15



NORI.    NORI our wholly-owned subsidiary, holds exploration rights to four blocks (NORI Area A, B, C, and D, the “NORI Contract Area”) covering 74,830 km2 in the CCZ that were granted by the ISA in July 2011. NORI is sponsored by Nauru pursuant to a certificate of sponsorship signed by the Government of Nauru on April 11, 2011. The NORI Area D” is the seafloor parcel where we have performed the most resource definition and environmental work to date. NORI commissioned AMC Consulting Ltd, a leading mining consulting firm (AMC), to undertake a preliminary economic assessment (“PEA”) of the mineral resource contained in NORI Area D and to compile a technical report compliant with Canadian National Instrument (NI 43-101), which was completed in March 2021. AMC subsequently compiled the NORI Technical Report Summary, dated March 2021, which included an initial assessment and an economic analysis of NORI Area D prepared in accordance with the SEC Mining Rules. The NORI Technical Report Summary is filed as Exhibit 96.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
TOML.    TOML our wholly-owned subsidiary which we acquired in March 2020, holds exploration rights to an area covering 74,713 km2 in the CCZ that were granted by the ISA in January 2012 (the “TOML Contract Area”). On March 8, 2008, Tonga and TOML entered into a sponsorship agreement formalizing certain obligations of the parties in relation to TOML’s exploration application to the ISA (subsequently granted) for the TOML Contract Area. The sponsorship agreement was updated on September 23, 2021. TOML commissioned a Technical Report Summary by AMC, dated March 2021, which is filed as Exhibit 96.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Marawa.    DGE, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into agreements with Marawa and Kiribati which provide DGE with exclusive exploration rights to an area covering 74,990 km2 in the CCZ (the “Marawa Contract Area”). The exploration contract between Marawa and the ISA (the “Marawa Exploration Contract”) was signed on January 19, 2015. To date, limited offshore marine resource definition activities in the Marawa Contract Area have occurred. We expect to collaborate with Marawa to assess the viability of any potential project in the Marawa Contract Area, although the timing of such assessment is uncertain. Marawa has delayed certain of its efforts in the Marawa Contract Area while it determines how it will move forward with additional assessment work.
​
​
Business Strategy
Our contemplated business spans the entire lifecycle from the resource acquisition and definition stage through the collection and transportation phases offshore into the processing and refining of nodules onshore and finally in product marketing and offtake (and eventually recycling of end-of-life products containing nodule-derived metals). NORI and TOML, two of our subsidiaries, intend to operate in the CCZ under the effective supervision, regulation and sponsorship of the government of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga, respectively. We intend to engage in processing operations in locations that are yet to be determined. We have chosen an asset-light approach to our operations and have focused on forming deep strategic partnerships with leading offshore and onshore companies.

16



Our key strategic alliances include:
Allseas: Allseas Group S.A. (Allseas), a leading global offshore contractor, has developed and successfully tested the pilot nodule collection system in the NORI Area D, completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. The experience from the development and testing program of the pilot system are now informing the design of upgrades and modifications into the initial smaller scale commercial production system which is expected to serve as the basis for the design of a full-scale commercial production system.
Glencore: Glencore International AG (Glencore) holds offtake rights to 50% of the NORI nickel and copper production.
Hatch and KPM: We have worked with engineering firm Hatch Ltd. (“Hatch”) and consultants Kingston Process Metallurgy Inc. (KPM) to develop a near-zero solid waste flowsheet. The primary processing stages of the flowsheet from nodule to NiCuCo matte intermediate were demonstrated as part of our pilot plant program at FLSmidth and Xpert Process Solutions’ (XPS, a Glencore company) facilities. The matte refining stages are being tested at SGS Lakefield. The near-zero solid waste flowsheet is expected to serve as the basis for our onshore processing facilities.
Other: In November 2022, we entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding (“MoU”) with Pacific Metals Co Ltd (PAMCO) of Japan, to evaluate the toll treatment of an initial quantity of 1.3 million tonnes of wet polymetallic nodules per year at PAMCO’s Hachinohe smelting facility starting in 2025. The toll treatment is intended to take place on a dedicated rotary kiln-electric arc furnace (RKEF) processing line and produce two products: nickel-copper-cobalt alloy — an intermediate product used as feedstock to produce Li-ion battery cathodes — and a manganese silicate product used to make silico-manganese alloy, a critical input into steel manufacturing. PAMCO’s Hachinohe facility is located on the coast in northern Japan and is equipped with port and processing infrastructure required to receive and process polymetallic nodules and to ship products to customers.
Under the MoU, PAMCO will undertake studies to estimate the cost of processing polymetallic nodules through existing facilities and identify any additional equipment requirements, currently expected to be minimal. This work will inform expected nodule through-put, process operating conditions and product specifications for PAMCO’s dedicated production line. PAMCO has received a 22-tonne sample of polymetallic nodules for use in the evaluations.
In parallel, PAMCO is studying the addition of a facility to process the intermediate alloy to nickel-copper-cobalt matte, which is an upgraded intermediate battery supply chain feedstock. It is anticipated that the additional facility would be constructed once commercial processing of polymetallic nodules to alloy has been demonstrated.
There can be no assurance that we will enter into a binding MoU or definitive strategic alliance with PAMCO in a particular time period, or at all, or on terms similar to those set forth in the MoU, or that if a binding MoU or definitive strategic alliance are entered into by us or that the existing facility will be able to successfully process nodules in a particular time period, or at all.
Phased Project Development
Currently, we are an exploration stage company with a completed initial assessment, working towards a pre-feasibility study. We expect to enter into the feasibility study phase in 2023, having completed the pilot collection test with Allseas in the CCZ in the fourth quarter of 2022. Having significantly advanced resource definition and environmental baseline studies on NORI Area D, we intend to apply for an exploitation contract on that area first. If we obtain an exploitation contract, we then plan to start with a small-scale commercial production (“Project Zero”) end of 2024 / start of 2025 in which we expect to collect and process at least 1.3Mtpa of wet nodules. Subject to the success of Project Zero and any regulatory requirements, we then expect to move into the next phase of production (“Project One”) in which we intend to scale up production and expect to collect and process up to approximately 12.5Mtpa of wet nodules at steady state (expected 2030-2045), as outlined in the NORI – D Technical Report Summary.

Current Work Program
We are currently focused on applying for our first exploitation contract from the ISA on the NORI Area D, as defined below, with the goal of starting commercial production end of 2024 / start of 2025. To reach our objective and initiate commercial production, we are: (i) defining our resource and project economics, (ii) developing an offshore nodule collection system, (iii) assessing the ESG impacts of offshore nodule collection, and (iv) developing onshore technology to process collected polymetallic nodules into a manganese silicate product, and an intermediate nickel-copper-cobalt matte product and/or end-products like nickel and cobalt sulfates, and copper cathode.

(i) | Resource definition and project economics: Having completed a total of nine offshore resource definition campaigns, collected samples and completed subsea surveys for resource evaluation, we have defined the size and quality of our resource in the NORI and TOML Areas, as described below, in our SEC Regulation S-K (subpart 1300) compliant Technical Report Summary - Initial Assessment of the NORI Property, Clarion-Clipperton Zone, Pacific Ocean dated March 17, 2021 (“NORI Initial Assessment”) and Technical Report Summary - TOML Mineral Resource, Clarion-Clipperton Zone, Pacific Ocean dated March 26, 2021 (“TOML Mineral Resource Statement”), respectively, prepared by AMC. From this work, both NORI and TOML have reported measured, indicated and inferred resources as tabulated below.

​
We plan to continue to define our resource in the NORI and TOML areas, develop project economics to pre-feasibility and feasibility level and convert resources into reserves.

(ii) | Offshore nodule collection system development: We are working with our strategic partner and investor, Allseas, to develop a system to collect, lift and transport nodules from the seafloor to shore. The offshore collection system consists of nodule collector vehicles on the seafloor, a riser and lift system, and a surface production support vessel. The nodules are collected from the seafloor by self-propelled, tracked nodule collector vehicles using seawater jets aimed at nodules in parallel with the seafloor. No rock cutting, digging, drill-and-blast or other breakage are required at the point of collection. The collectors are remotely controlled and supplied with electric power via umbilical cables from the production support vessel, the Hidden Gem. To test the system and assess its environmental impacts, we entered into a contract with Allseas to undertake a pilot trial of the collection system in the NORI Area D, which was completed in November 2022. The successful completion of the pilot trial will support our application for an exploitation contract with the ISA. An Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) for this pilot trial was submitted to the ISA in July 2021 and approved on September 7, 2022, with infield testing commencing on September 19, 2022. The surface production support vessel, the Hidden Gem, was acquired by Allseas in March 2020 and has strategic importance to us, since it supported the pilot trial and is expected to be upgraded to a small-scale, low-capital early production system. The vessel and collector system successfully completed trials in shallow and deepwater in the first half of 2022 prior to completing the collector test in the NORI-D Area in the fall of 2022 where approximately 4,500 tonnes of wet nodules were collected and more than 3000 tonnes of wet nodules were lifted 4.3km to the surface after traversing over 80km of the seafloor, achieving a production rate of 86.4 tonnes per hour.

(iii) | Environmental and social impact assessment (“ESIA”) for offshore nodule collection: The ESIA is an integral part of preparing our application for the ISA exploitation contract on the NORI Area D. Our ESIA program consists of over 100 studies and relies on the work of several independent deep-sea research institutions. In 2022, we undertook the collector test monitoring campaigns which involved completion of pre-collector test baseline data collection, monitoring of the collector test to and completion of post collection surveys to determine the immediate collector impact to the environment. The monitoring was undertaken using the Island Pride, a vessel contracted from Ocean Infinity Group Limited, deploying 2 ROVs, 3 AUVs and an array of more than 50 seafloor sensors, supervised by multiple teams of scientists and sediment plume expert consultants, DHI Water and Environment Inc. and HR Wallingford. These campaigns commenced on July 15, 2022 and were completed on December 23, 2022, representing 146 operational days at sea. We continue to assess the data collected from these tests.

(iv) | Onshore technology development: To process and refine collected nodules into critical metals, we have developed a flowsheet together with a metallurgical process design firm, Hatch. This flowsheet uses conventional equipment, modified for the unique nature of the polymetallic nodule resource to deliver a process that is expected to generate near zero solid waste. The key products generated by this process are nickel sulfate, cobalt sulfate, copper cathode, manganese silicate and fertilizer-grade ammonium sulfate. The processing flowsheet also provides the potential to generate an intermediate product, a nickel-copper-cobalt matte and a nickel-copper-cobalt-iron alloy. Nickel is expected to account for almost half of future production revenues. We have completed lab-scale test work and offshore campaigns to collect a bulk sample for pilot-scale metallurgical testing. We are continuing with a metallurgical test program. In 2021, we successfully completed calcining and smelting of the nodule bulk samples into a manganese silicate product and nickel-copper-cobalt alloy intermediate, followed by converting and sulfidation of the alloy into matte. We continue testing the hydrometallurgical refining phase where matte is processed to produce nickel sulfate, cobalt sulfate, copper cathode and fertilizer grade ammonium sulfate.

Additionally, we were engaged in several technical scoping studies for a potential first small-scale production plant in Asia. On March 16, 2022, we announced a business collaboration with Epsilon Carbon Pvt., LTD. (“Epsilon Carbon”) to complete a pre-feasibility study for a new-build commercial polymetallic nodule processing plant in India. However, having faced significant issues in securing process engineering capacity in 2022, Epsilon Carbon and TMC agreed that using an existing metallurgical facility requires less capital expenditures and which we believe may offer a lower risk solution for the Project Zero Plant and the construction of a new build plant in India should be revisited once Project Zero is in production. In November 2022, we signed a non-binding MoU with PAMCO to evaluate the toll treatment of an initial quantity of 1.3 million tonnes of wet polymetallic nodules per year at PAMCO’s Hachinohe smelting facility starting in 2025. Potential progression to a NiCuCo matte product along with potentially higher throughputs are also included in the evaluation study. We expect this partnership to progress to a binding MoU and a strategic alliance in the second half of 2023, subject to successful evaluation study outcomes and agreement to mutually acceptable commercial terms, in lieu of continuing to pursue an opportunity to build a new Project Zero Plant in India together with Epsilon Carbon as was previously envisioned under our March 2022 business collaboration MoU with Epsilon Carbon. There can be no assurance that we will enter into such binding MoU or definitive strategic alliance in a particular time period, or at all, or on terms similar to those set forth in the MoU, or that if such binding MoU or definitive strategic alliance are entered into by us or that the existing facility will be able to successfully process nodules in a particular time period, or at all.
Summary of Mineral Resources

As reflected in the initial economic analysis of NORI Area D contained in the NORI Technical Report Summary, a discounted cash flow analysis considering the intended pre-development work in 2024, discounting at 9% per annum, and assuming metal prices for nickel metal $16,472/t; nickel in nickel sulfate $18,807/t Ni; copper metal $6,872/t; cobalt metal $46,333/t; cobalt in cobalt sulfate $56,920/t Co; manganese in manganese silicate $4.50/dmtu Mn, indicates a NORI Area D project net present value (as of January 1, 2021) of $6.8 billion. The initial assessment included in the NORI Technical Report Summary is a conceptual study of the potential viability of NORI’s mineral resources. This initial assessment indicates that development of the NORI mineral resource is potentially technically and economically viable; however, due to the preliminary nature of project planning and design, and the untested nature of the specific seafloor production systems at a commercial scale, economic viability has not yet been demonstrated.
The NORI Technical Report Summary and TOML Technical Report Summary do not include the conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves.
You are specifically cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into mineral reserves, as defined by the SEC. You are also cautioned that mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic value. Inferred mineral resources have a high degree of uncertainty as to their existence and to whether they can be economically or legally commercialized. Under the SEC Mining Rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of an economic analysis. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. A significant amount of exploration must be completed in order to determine whether an inferred mineral resource may be upgraded to a higher category. Therefore, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, that it can be economically or legally commercialized, or that it will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Approximately 97% of the NORI Area D resource is categorized as measured or indicated.
Likewise, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated mineral resources will ever be upgraded to mineral reserves.
Collection and Processing of Polymetallic Nodules
Collection and Shipping
We are planning a phased development for NORI Area D. Polymetallic nodules would be collected using offshore collection systems, comprising of nodule collector vehicles on the seafloor, a riser and lifting system (RALS) in the water column, and a production support vessel on the surface. The nodules are expected to be transferred to transport vessels and shipped to onshore processing facilities.

22



Through our strategic partnership with Allseas, a former drillship vessel (the Hidden Gem) acquired by Allseas in February 2020 has been converted and modified to undertake a pre-production collector test in which a collector vehicle, RALS and other systems have been tested. If we obtain an exploitation contract, the first phase of commercial production (“Project Zero”) would then be expected to commence after the Hidden Gem has been upgraded to become a production support vessel that can produce at least 1.3 Mtpa (wet) of nodules. The nodules collected in Project Zero are expected to be processed through existing third-party Rotary Kiln-Electric arc Furnace (“RKEF”) facilities on a tolling basis. In the next phase of development (“Project One”), as outlined in the NORI – D Initial Assessment Technical Report Summary, production is expected to be expanded with an additional converted drillship (Drill Ship 2), a subsequent upgrade to the Hidden Gem, and the construction of a bespoke production support vessel (Collector Ship 1).
​

23



In order to test the collection system, we entered into a contract with Allseas to undertake a pre-production collector test, which was successfully completed in the second half of 2022. We expect that Project Zero commercial production would then commence after the upgrading of the Hidden Gem into a production vessel. If we obtain an exploitation contract, we expect to collect at least 1.3 Mtpa (wet) of polymetallic nodules as part Project Zero. For Project One, we believe that a fleet of three production vessels, each with multiple dedicated nodule collector vehicles, could be estimated to produce approximately 12.5 Mtpa of wet nodules at steady state (expected 2030-2045), which we intend to process, either at a new facility to be constructed by us or by potential processing partners, subject to available capital, or at third-party facilities pursuant to a toll treatment model.
​
​
​
We believe that this phased approach to development allows for proper management of risk and for progressive improvement of engineering and operating systems. The intention is to implement the project in multiple phases that will allow the offshore collection systems to be tested and then polymetallic nodule production to be gradually ramped-up. We also believe that this approach will de-risk the project for a relatively low initial capital investment. Additionally, this phased development will allow for an adaptive approach to environmental management providing learning at small-scale which would be applied as production increases in scale.
Mineral Processing and Refining and Metallurgical Testing
Pyrometallurgical processing of polymetallic nodules has been extensively studied since the early 1970s.
From an early stage, we have recognized that processing represents a key to potentially commercializing seafloor polymetallic nodules and to becoming a low-cost producer of nickel, manganese, copper and cobalt products. Moreover, we believe that there is a commercial advantage in positioning ourselves as a leader in the onshore processing of seafloor polymetallic nodules.
To this end, we have been working with leading global process engineering group Hatch, and a professional services firm, to develop pyrometallurgical processing and hydrometallurgical refining technologies for the production of battery metals feedstocks from nodules. Hatch has developed a near-zero solid waste flowsheet and has overseen a pyrometallurgical pilot plant program consisting of several phases: the pyrometallurgical processing phase has been completed at FLSmidth’s and XPS Solutions’ (Glencore subsidiary) facilities, the hydrometallurgical refining phase is in progress at SGS facilities. Pursuant to an engineering and consulting services agreement, Hatch is assisting and advising us during the development of the pilot test program and is analyzing and interpreting the testing results through reports provided by such test facilities.

24



We expect that the processing of the polymetallic nodules from the NORI Contract Area would also be ramped up in phases. This plan includes initially toll treating polymetallic nodules at existing RKEF plants, utilizing existing excess industry capacity. We believe that there is significant interest to deploy underutilized RKEF plants which may have become stranded as a result of the Indonesian government nickel laterite ore export ban restricting supply of the nickel laterite feedstock that they have previously utilized. These RKEF plants were originally built to convert nickel laterite to ferro-nickel alloy or nickel pig iron and could potentially be converted to smelt polymetallic nodules. While we have not completed the negotiations of any definitive agreements with RKEF plants owners, we believe that we may be able to do so in the future on commercially reasonable terms. 
In the future, based on the work performed by Hatch and subject to available capital, we are contemplating the construction of a processing plant(s) for Project One, which may include pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical circuits. Nodule processing would be increased in phases by treatment in this new plant or plants.
Strategic Alliances and Key Commercial Agreements
Allseas Agreements
On March 29, 2019, we entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement with Allseas, whereby the parties will conduct project development of an integrated offshore nodule collection system for use by our subsidiaries. As initially constituted, Allseas agreed to subscribe for (i) 6,666,667 DeepGreen Common Shares for a purchase price of $20,000,000 in cash (the “Subscription”), the entire amount of which was funded, and (ii) an additional 10,000,000 DeepGreen Common Shares in exchange for services rendered by Allseas in respect of the contemplated pilot mining test system (the “PMTS”), which would be designed, built and tested by Allseas. The 10,000,000 shares would only be issued upon completion of the pilot mining test in the CCZ using the PMTS (the “Success Fee Shares”), along with an additional $30 million cash success fee that would be payable simultaneously therewith. The Strategic Alliance Agreement also contemplated that the parties would enter into other commercial arrangements following the successful completion of the pilot trials of the PMTS in the CCZ.
On July 8, 2019, we and Allseas entered into the Pilot Mining Test Agreement (the “PMTA”), which governed the terms, design specifications, procedures, and timetable under which Allseas agreed to complete and test the PMTS, to be used by NORI. The PMTA was subsequently amended on September 1, 2019, February 20, 2020, March 4, 2021, June 30, 2021 and February 8, 2023. The Strategic Alliance Agreement was also amended on March 4, 2021 (collectively with the PMTA amendment of the same date, the “Amendment”), which Amendment became effective upon closing of the Business Combination. Pursuant to the Amendment, the cash fee payable pursuant to the PMTA was amended such that we would pay to Allseas (i) $10,000,000 on June 30, 2021 (which we subsequently amended with Allseas to change to within 10 business days of the Closing of the Business Combination in a further amendment; this amount was paid on October 5, 2021), (ii) $10,000,000 on the later of January 1, 2022 and such time that confirmation is received with respect to the successful completion of the North Sea drive test, which was paid on April 25, 2022, and (iii) $10,000,000 upon successful completion of the pilot trials in the CCZ using the PMTS which was settled through the issuance of 10 million common shares in February 2023, along with additional costs owed Allseas under the PMTA in 850,000 common shares, in each case, priced at $1.00 per share under the fifth amendment to the PMTA. Pursuant to the Amendment, except as provided therein, Allseas may not, without our prior written consent, terminate the Strategic Alliance Agreement or the PMTA before NORI receives an ISA exploitation contract. 
Also on March 4, 2021, we issued the Allseas Warrant to Allseas, which became exercisable for 11.6 million common shares in November 11, 2022, upon the successful completion of the CCZ trial using the PMTS. The Allseas Warrant was issued to Allseas in lieu of any future obligation to issue the Success Fee Shares. The Allseas Warrant will expire on September 30, 2026. 
The PMTA terminated by its terms upon the successful completion of the PMTS, whereas the overarching Strategic Alliance Agreement will remain in place. 

25



On March 16, 2022, NORI and Allseas entered into a non-binding term sheet for the development and operation of a commercial nodule collection system. The PMTS developed and tested by Allseas is expected to be upgraded to a commercial system with a targeted production capacity of at least 1.3 Mtpa of wet nodules with expected production readiness by the fourth quarter of 2024 (“Project Zero System”). NORI and Allseas intended to equally finance all costs related to developing and getting Project Zero System into production that were estimated at less than EUR100 million. It was anticipated that NORI will not have to make any Project Zero System-related payments to Allseas until later in 2023. Once in production, NORI expected to pay Allseas a nodule collection and transshipment fee estimated at approximately EUR 150 per wet tonne in the first year of operations and expected to be reduced by more than 20% in the following years as Allseas scaled up production to at least 1.3 Mtpa of wet nodules. Following the successful completion of the NORI Area D pilot collection system trials in November 2022 and subsequent analysis of pilot data, the parties are reviewing Project Zero System production target increases, system design changes and associated cost estimates revisions and intend to enter into a binding Heads of Terms in the second half of 2023. The parties expect to further detail their relationship in three separate definitive agreements for engineering, conversion/build and commercial operations phase, respectively.
Subject to the necessary regulatory approvals, Allseas and NORI also intend to investigate acquiring a second production vessel similar to the Hidden Gem, a further Samsung 10000, with the potential for it to be engineered to support a higher production rate of 3 million tonnes of wet nodules per year and lower associated per tonne production cost. 
There can be no assurances, however, that we will enter into definitive agreements with Allseas contemplated by the non-binding term sheet in a particular time period, or at all, or on terms similar to those set forth in the non-binding term sheet, or that if such definitive agreements are entered into by us that the proposed commercial systems and second production vessel will be successfully developed or operated in a particular time period, or at all.
Offtake Agreements
On May 25, 2012, our wholly-owned subsidiary, DGE, and Glencore, entered into a copper offtake agreement and a separate nickel offtake agreement (together, the “Glencore Offtake Agreements”), pursuant to which Glencore has the right to purchase from DGE 50% of the annual quantity of copper material and 50% of the annual quantity of nickel material produced by DGE from ore derived from the NORI Contract Area at a processing plant directly owned or controlled by DGE. Pursuant to the Glencore Offtake Agreements, for London Metal Exchange (“LME”) Codelco registered Grade “A” copper cathodes, the delivered price is the official LME Copper Grade “A” Cash Settlement quotation as published in the London Metal Bulletin averaged over the month of shipment or the following month at Glencore’s choice, plus the official long-term contract premium as announced annually by Codelco, basis CIF Main European Ports (Rotterdam, the Netherlands). For LME Registered Primary Nickel, the delivered price is the official LME Primary Nickel Cash Settlement averaged over the month of shipping or the following month at Glencore’s choice. For other copper-bearing material and other nickel-bearing material, the parties shall agree a price annually for the forthcoming calendar year on the basis of prevailing market prices for such copper products and such nickel products. The Glencore Offtake Agreements are for the life of the NORI Contract Area, and either party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach or insolvency of the other party. Glencore may also terminate either agreement by giving 12 months’ prior written notice. The Glencore Offtake Agreements do not extend to any other of our entities in the event other entities are the ultimate processing owners for metal products. The Glencore Offtake Agreements only apply with respect to metals processed and developed from the NORI areas that are processed by a facility owned or controlled by DGE and do not apply to other projects (including for example Marawa or TOML). Concurrent with entering into the Glencore Offtake Agreements, Glencore made an equity investment of $5 million into our company.

Non-Binding Memorandum of Understanding
On March 16, 2022, we announced a business collaboration with Epsilon Carbon to complete a pre-feasibility study for a new-build commercial polymetallic nodule processing plant in India with the targeted production capacity of more than 30,000 tonnes per annum (TPA) of an intermediate nickel-copper-cobalt matte product used for active cathode material (CAM) for Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) and other nickel-rich cathode chemistries for lithium-ion batteries and more than 750,000 TPA of manganese silicate by-product expected to be used in manganese alloy production for the steel industry (“Project Zero Plant”). Epsilon Carbon intended to deliver a pre-feasibility report (“PFR”) for a potential plant in India powered by renewables and with the targeted processing capacity of 1.3 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of wet nodules and production start in time to receive nodules collected from NORI Area D starting around the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to our subsidiary NORI securing an exploitation contract from the ISA. However, Epsilon Carbon and TMC agreed that using an existing metallurgical facility requires less capital expenditures and which we believe may offer a lower risk solution for the Project Zero Plant and the construction of a new build plant in India should be revisited once Project Zero is in production.
In November 2022, we entered into a non-binding MoU with Pacific Metals Co Ltd (PAMCO) of Japan, to evaluate the toll treatment of an initial quantity of 1.3 million tonnes of wet polymetallic nodules per year at PAMCO’s Hachinohe smelting facility starting in 2025. The toll treatment is intended to take place on a dedicated rotary kiln-electric arc furnace (RKEF) processing line and produce two products: nickel-copper-cobalt alloy — an intermediate product used as feedstock to produce Li-ion battery cathodes — and a manganese silicate product used to make silico-manganese alloy, a critical input into steel manufacturing. We expect this partnership to progress to a binding MoU and a strategic alliance in the second half of 2023, subject to successful evaluation study outcomes and agreement to mutually acceptable commercial terms. We expect to pursue this existing Project Zero Plant opportunity in lieu of continuing to pursue an opportunity to build a new Project Zero Plant in India together with Epsilon Carbon, as was previously envisioned under our March 2022 business collaboration MoU with Epsilon Carbon. There can be no assurance that we will enter into such binding MoU or definitive strategic alliance in a particular time period, or at all, or on terms similar to those set forth in the MoU, or that if such binding MoU or definitive strategic alliance are entered into by us or that the existing facility will be able to successfully process nodules in a particular time period, or at all.
Competition
The metals production industry is capital intensive and competitive. Production of battery materials and manganese alloys is largely dominated by Chinese or Chinese-funded competitors. These competitors may have greater financial resources, as well as other strategic advantages to operate, maintain, improve and possibly expand their facilities. Additionally, Chinese resources firms have historically been able to produce minerals and/or process metals from land-based operations in developing countries across the globe (e.g., cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, nickel in Indonesia and Philippines) at relatively low costs due to economic and regulatory factors, including less stringent environmental and governmental regulations and lower labor and benefit costs. We may be unable to compete successfully with these and other competitors, including other land-based mining operations. In addition to three contracts held by our subsidiaries and partners, 16 other entities (ISA Member States and private companies sponsored by ISA Member States) currently hold ISA Exploration Contracts for polymetallic nodules in the CCZ, Western Pacific and Indian Ocean Basin. Furthermore, several Norwegian deep sea mining companies (Loke, Green Minerals) have stated ambitions and non-binding MoUs to acquire polymetallic nodule exploration contracts in the CCZ. If and when they move into the exploitation phase, each of these contract-holders could become potential competitors with respect to the collection of polymetallic nodules and the production of nickel, manganese, copper and cobalt products. Furthermore, several nation states are working on developing polymetallic nodule resources inside their Exclusive Economic Zones (“EEZs”), with the Cook Islands granting three exploration contracts for polymetallic nodules in February 2022. Beyond polymetallic nodules, nations like Norway, Japan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are exploring other types of deep-sea resources containing some of the metals contained in polymetallic nodules. There is increasing competition from new and existing marine mineral companies for the availability of marine exploration and support vessels, related marine equipment and specialized personnel, desirable exploration areas, suitable offshore collection and onshore processing equipment, and available capital. Some of our competitors may equally find more promising resources, identify or develop more economic technologies, enter into strategic partnerships that constrain our optionality, or may develop novel methods to collect nodules from the seafloor or process nodules into metals that are more economic than we currently contemplate.

Regulations
On March 4, 2023, UN member states agreed on the text for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement or “High Seas Treaty”). The treaty does not replace or amend UNCLOS, or the authority of the ISA, and must be interpreted consistently with the rights granted by the Convention. The treaty has a goal of placing up to 30% of the world’s oceans under protection by 2030. In the Clarion Clipperton Zone of the Pacific Ocean, where our subsidiaries operate, the ISA has already exceeded this target with 43% of the CCZ already under protection.
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
The Area is defined as the seabed and subsoil beyond the limits of national jurisdiction (UNCLOS Article 1).
The principal policy documents governing the Area, including the CCZ, include:

● | the UNCLOS, of 10 December 1982; and
--+-------------------------------------


● | the 1994 Implementation Agreement.
--+-----------------------------------

UNCLOS deals with, among other things, navigational rights, territorial sea limits, exclusive economic zone jurisdiction, the continental shelf, freedom of the high seas, legal status of resources on the seabed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, passage of ships through narrow straits, conservation and management of living marine resources in the high seas, protection of the marine environment, marine scientific research, and settlement of disputes.
​
​
Part XI of UNCLOS and the 1994 Implementation Agreement deal with mineral exploration and collection in the international seabed, known as the Area, providing a framework for entities to obtain legal title to areas of the seafloor from the ISA for the purpose of exploration and eventually collection of resources. UNCLOS became effective on November 16, 1994. A subsequent agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of UNCLOS was adopted on July 28, 1994 and became effective on July 28, 1996. The 1994 Implementation Agreement and Part XI of UNCLOS are to be interpreted and applied together as a single instrument. As of March 27, 2023, UNCLOS had been signed by 167 States (countries) and the European Union.

International Seabed Authority (“ISA”)
The ISA is an autonomous international organization established under UNCLOS and the 1994 Implementation Agreement to organize and control activities in the Area, particularly with a view to administering and regulating the development of the resources of the Area, in accordance with the legal regime established under UNCLOS and the 1994 Implementation Agreement. In so doing, the ISA has the mandate to regulate all mineral related activities in the Area for the benefit of humankind and ensure the effective protection of the marine environment from harmful effects that may arise from deep-seabed related activities. The ISA is comprised of UNCLOS signatories, 167 Member States, and the European Union. All parties to UNCLOS are members of the ISA. Two principal entities establish the policies and govern the work of the ISA: the Assembly, where all 168 members are represented (the “Assembly”), and a 36-member council elected by the Assembly (the “Council”). The Council has two advisory bodies: the Legal Technical Commission (LTC) (41 members), which advises the Council on matters relating to the exploration and collection of non-living marine resources, such as polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, and the Finance Committee (15 members), which deals with budgetary and related matters.
All rules, regulations, and procedures issued by the ISA to regulate prospecting, exploration, and collection of marine minerals are issued within a general legal framework established by UNCLOS and the 1994 Implementation Agreement. To date, the ISA has issued the following regulations (https://www.isa.org.jm/mining-code/Regulations):

● | The Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules in the CCZ (adopted July 13, 2000, as amended in 2013; the Regulations).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Sulphides (adopted May 7, 2010).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Cobalt-Rich Ferromanganese Crusts in the CCZ (July 2012).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No commercial polymetallic nodule collection operations have started anywhere in the world. Currently, exploration activities undertaken are aimed at gathering the necessary information on the location, quality and quantity of the minerals of the seabed as well as collecting the necessary environmental baseline information. To date, the ISA has approved 17 contracts in the CCZ for exploration of nodules, one in the Indian Ocean and one in the Western Pacific Ocean covering more than 1.35 million square kilometers of the seabed. This represents only 0.3 percent of the world’s oceans seafloor. Twelve of these contracts are sponsored by developing countries (including the sponsors of our subsidiaries NORI — Nauru, and TOML — Tonga, and our partner Marawa which is sponsored by the Republic of Kiribati). Thirteen countries and one intergovernmental consortium currently have contracts for the exploration of polymetallic nodules, seven countries have contracts for the exploration of polymetallic sulphides, and five countries have contracts for the exploration of cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts. To date, no exploitation contracts for extracting minerals from the seafloor within the CCZ have been granted. The ISA is currently working on the development of a legal framework to regulate the commercialization of mineral development activities, as described below.
In 2014, the ISA completed a study looking at comparative extractive regulatory regimes. This was followed in March 2014 with a stakeholder survey seeking comments on what financial, environmental, and health and safety obligations should be included under the framework (ISA 2014).
In August 2017, the Council released the first Draft Regulations on Exploitation of Mineral Resources in the CCZ, as subsequently amended. In March 2019, the Council released the advance and unedited text (English only) of the Draft Regulations on Exploitation of Mineral Resources in the CCZ (ISBA/25/LTC/WP.1) (ISA, 2018). The revised draft exploitation regulations incorporated the consideration of requests addressed to the LTC by the Council during the first part of the 24th Session in March 2018, as well as certain comments by the Commission, and also reflected the responses to the first draft from stakeholder submissions. The exploitation regulations will create the legal and technical framework for collection and related operations. Finalization of the exploitation regulations remains subject to the decision of the members of the ISA. Final exploitation regulations must be adopted by the Council. The ISA was targeting to finalize these regulations by July 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted ISA meetings and discussions.

29



The current proposed application process in the draft exploitation regulations consists of the following:
​
​
We are still in the exploration phase of the project and have not yet obtained an exploitation contract from the ISA (“ISA Exploitation Contract”) to commence commercial-scale polymetallic nodule collection in the CCZ. An ISA exploitation contract application is comprised of several components, including an EIS for the proposed commercial operations, the end-product of a comprehensive ESIA program. In addition, we do not have the applicable environmental and other permits required to build and operate commercial scale polymetallic nodule processing and refining plants on land.
Section 1, paragraph 15 of the 1994 Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the UNCLOS allows a member state whose national intends to apply for approval of a plan of work for exploitation to notify the ISA of such intention. This notice obliges the ISA to complete the adoption of exploitation regulations within two years of the request made by the member state.
On June 25, 2021, Nauru submitted its notice to the ISA requesting that it complete the adoption, by July 9, 2023, of rules, regulations and procedures necessary to facilitate the approval of plans of work for exploitation in the Area. In June 2022, a member State submitted a position paper to the ISA urging that the deadline to adopt the exploitation regulations be extended for a period of 15 years. Although we believe that the notice submitted by Nauru to the ISA has increased the likelihood that exploitation regulations and any necessary rules, regulations and procedures to facilitate the approval of a plan of work for exploitation will be adopted by mid-2023, there can be no assurances that the adoption of these regulations will not be delayed or halted paused as a result of the actions of ISA member States. If the ISA Council has not completed the adoption of such regulations within the prescribed time and an application for approval of a plan of work for exploitation is pending, the ISA shall nonetheless consider and provisionally approve such a plan of work for exploitation based on: (i) the provisions of the UNCLOS; (ii) any rules, regulations and procedures that the ISA may have adopted provisionally, (iii) the basis of the norms contained in the UNCLOS and (iv) the terms and principles contained in the Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI, including the principle of non-discrimination among contractors. There can be no assurance that the ISA will provisionally approve our plan or that such provisional approval would lead to the issuance of an exploitation contract by the ISA.
In December 2021, the ISA held in-person meetings in Kingston Jamaica and established a work plan and road map to finalize regulations by July 2023 for the commercial exploitation of seabed minerals, including those necessary for the collection of polymetallic nodules. In November 2022, the ISA developed an updated road map for 2023 that includes three Council sessions and one week of Assembly meetings that will be focused primarily on the finalization of the regulations in 2023. Once adopted, these regulations will create the legal and technical framework for exploitation of polymetallic nodules.

30



While, the ISA has developed a work plan and road map to adopt the Final Regulations by July 2023, there can be no assurance that such regulations will be adopted then, or at all. The Draft Regulations and several supporting standards and guidelines are at an advanced stage, but there remains uncertainty regarding the final form that these will take as well as the impact that such regulations, standards and guidelines will have on our ability to meet our objectives. If the Final Regulations are not adopted by July 2023, a plan of work for exploitation may nevertheless be submitted to the ISA for consideration and provisional approval pursuant to Section 1, Paragraph 15 of the Annex to the Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the UNCLOS. There can be no assurance that the ISA will provisionally approve any such plan or that any such provisional approval would lead to the issuance of an exploitation contract by the ISA.
On March 4, 2023, the United Nations finalized the UN High Seas Treaty. The treaty does not replace or amend UNCLOS, or the authority of the ISA, and must be interpreted consistently with the rights granted by the Convention. The treaty has a goal of placing up to 30% of the world’s oceans under protection by 2030. In the CCZ, where our subsidiaries operate, the ISA has already exceeded this target with 43% of the CCZ already under protection.
The NORI Exploration Contract
In July 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary, NORI, was granted a polymetallic nodule exploration contract by the ISA, providing it exclusive rights to explore 74,830 km2 in the CCZ pursuant to the NORI Exploration Contract (“NORI Exploration Contract”). The NORI Exploration Contract was approved by the Council on July 19, 2011, and entered into on July 22, 2011 between NORI and the ISA, and terminates on July 22, 2026, subject to extension.
The NORI Exploration Contract, which was granted pursuant to the ISA’s Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules in the CCZ (the “Regulations”), formalized a 74,830 km2 exploration area, has an initial term of 15 years (subject to renewal for successive five-year periods), and provides for certain obligations with respect to exploration, training, and other programs of activities for an initial five-year period. The NORI Exploration Contract also formalized the rights of NORI around future rights. Pursuant to the Regulations, NORI has the priority right to apply for an exploitation contract to collect polymetallic nodules in the same area (Regulation 24(2)). Such preference or priority may be withdrawn by the Council if the contractor has failed to comply with the requirements of its approved plan of work for exploration within the time period specified in a written notice or notices from the Council to the contractor indicating which requirements have not been complied with by the contractor. After a hearing process, the Council would be required to provide the reasons for its proposed withdrawal of preference or priority and shall consider any contractor’s response. The decision of the Council shall take account of that response and shall be based on substantial evidence. As soon as practicable, NORI intends to submit an application to collect polymetallic nodules in the same area as its current exploration rights. To date, no exploitation contracts for extracting minerals from the international seafloor have been granted. The ISA is currently working on the development of a legal framework to regulate the exploitation of polymetallic nodules in the Area, as described above.
In 2021, NORI submitted a review of the implementation of the plan of work for the period from 2017 to 2021 to the ISA. The review included a proposed plan of work for the next five-year period from 2022 to 2026. On February 3, 2022, the ISA confirmed that the Secretariat and Commission had reviewed NORI’s report and noted that the program of activities for the next five-year period was acceptable. The ISA requested clarification on a few matters and noted that the periodic review would be concluded if the clarifications were received within 30 days. On February 28, 2022, NORI provided the clarification in response to the request by the ISA and on June 1, 2022, the ISA accepted NORI’s proposed program of activities.
The ISA Council may suspend or terminate the NORI Exploration Contract, without prejudice to any other rights that the ISA may have, if any of the following events should occur:

● | if, in spite of written warnings by the ISA, NORI has conducted its activities in such a way as to result in serious persistent and willful violations of the fundamental terms of the NORI Exploration Contract, Part XI of UNCLOS, the 1994 Agreement and the rules, regulations and procedures of the ISA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if NORI has failed to comply with a final binding decision of the dispute settlement body applicable to it; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

31




● | if NORI becomes insolvent or commits an act of bankruptcy or enters into any agreement for composition with its creditors or goes into liquidation or receivership, whether compulsory or voluntary, or petitions or applies to any tribunal for the appointment of a receiver or a trustee or receiver for itself or commences any proceedings relating to itself under any bankruptcy, insolvency or readjustment of debt law, whether now or hereafter in effect, other than for the purpose of reconstruction.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, if the nationality or control of NORI changes or NORI’s Sponsoring State, as defined in the Regulations, terminates its sponsorship and NORI does not obtain another sponsor meeting the requirements prescribed in the Regulations, then the NORI Exploration Contract will terminate.
The NORI Sponsorship Agreement
NORI is sponsored by Nauru pursuant to a certificate of sponsorship signed by the Government of Nauru on April 11, 2011. NORI is a Nauruan incorporated entity and is subject to applicable Nauruan legislation and regulations. In 2015, the Nauruan government established the Nauru Seabed Minerals Authority to regulate activities carried out by companies sponsored by Nauru.
Throughout the period of the NORI Exploration Contract, NORI must be sponsored by a State that is party to UNCLOS. If the nationality or control of NORI changes or NORI’s Sponsoring State, as defined in the Regulations, terminates its sponsorship, NORI must promptly notify the ISA. In either event, if NORI does not obtain another sponsor meeting the requirements prescribed in the Regulations and fails to submit to the ISA a certificate of sponsorship for NORI in the prescribed form within six months, the NORI Exploration Contract will terminate.
On July 5, 2017, Nauru, the Nauru Seabed Minerals Authority and NORI entered into a sponsorship agreement (the “NORI Sponsorship Agreement”) formalizing certain obligations of the parties in relation to NORI’s exploration and potential collection of nodules within the NORI Contract Area of the CCZ. The NORI Sponsorship Agreement will remain in force for the duration of the 15-year NORI Exploration Contract and will automatically extend for a further 20 years upon NORI reaching the minimum recovery level under an ISA Exploitation Contract, unless earlier terminated by the ISA as a result of NORI’s breach of the NORI Exploration Contract or pursuant to its terms. Upon reaching the minimum recovery level within the tenement area, NORI will pay Nauru a seabed mineral recovery payment based on the polymetallic nodules recovered from the tenement area. In addition, NORI will pay an administration fee each year to Nauru for such administration and sponsorship, which is subject to review and increase in the event that NORI is granted an ISA Exploitation Contract. NORI has begun discussions with the Government of Nauru to renegotiate the existing sponsorship agreement and has committed to paying corporate income tax within Nauru.
During exploration, NORI is required to, among other things:

● | submit an annual report to the ISA;
--+------------------------------------


● | meet certain performance and expenditure commitments;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | pay an annual overhead charge to cover the costs incurred by the ISA in administering and supervising the contract;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | implement training programs for personnel of the ISA and developing countries in accordance with a training program proposed by NORI in its license application;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | take measures to prevent, reduce, and control pollution and other hazards to the marine environment arising from its activities in the CCZ;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintain appropriate insurance policies;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | establish environmental baselines against which to assess the likely effects of its program of activities on the marine environment; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establish and implement a program to monitor and report on such effects.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

32



NORI is sponsored to carry out its mineral exploration activities in the CCZ by Nauru, pursuant to a certificate of sponsorship signed by the Government of Nauru on April 11, 2011. Sponsorship of an entity requires the sponsoring State to certify that it assumes responsibility for the entity’s activities in the CCZ in accordance with UNCLOS. NORI is a Nauruan incorporated entity and is subject to applicable Nauruan legislation and regulations.
The TOML Exploration Contract
In March 2020, we acquired TOML from Deep Sea Mining Finance Limited, providing us with exclusive rights to explore a 74,713 km2 area of the CCZ seabed. TOML holds an exploration contract granted by the ISA and sponsored by the Kingdom of Tonga pursuant to the TOML Exploration Contract (“TOML Exploration Contract”). The plan of work was approved by the Council, acting on the recommendation of the LTC, on July 19, 2011. The TOML Exploration Contract was then signed on January 11, 2012 between TOML and the ISA and terminates on January 11, 2027, subject to a potential extension under the terms of the agreement.
The TOML Exploration Contract was granted pursuant to the ISA’s Regulations, as well as Article 153 of UNCLOS, and formalized a 74,713 km2 exploration area. The TOML Exploration Contract includes an initial term of 15 years, which may be extended under the contract, and a program of activities to be completed within the first five-year period of the term. The TOML Exploration Contract also formalized the rights of TOML around future rights. Pursuant to the Regulations, TOML has the priority right to apply for an ISA Exploitation Contract to collect polymetallic nodules in the same area (Regulation 24(2)). The Regulations state that a contractor who has an approved plan of work for exploration only shall have a preference and a priority among applicants submitting plans of work for collection of the same area and resources. Such preference or priority may be withdrawn by the Council if the contractor has failed to comply with the requirements of its approved plan of work for exploration within the time period specified in a written notice or notices from the Council to the contractor indicating which requirements have not been complied with by the contractor. After a hearing process, the Council shall provide the reasons for its proposed withdrawal of preference or priority and shall consider any contractor’s response. The decision of the Council shall take account of that response and shall be based on substantial evidence.
Under ISA requirements contractors are required to submit five-year work programs. The first TOML five-year work program was completed in 2016 and reviewed and accepted by the ISA in late 2016. In 2021, TOML submitted a review of the implementation of the plan of work for the period from 2017 to 2021 to the ISA. The review included a proposed plan of work for the next five-year period from 2022 to 2026. 
For the second five-year period ending in 2021, the proposed program included the following: (i) continue environmental baseline work; (ii) complete pilot testing; (iii) complete geotechnical studies; (iv) complete feasibility studies; (v) first draft EIS/EMMP; and (vi) continue training. TOML noted that the program was dependent on success at each stage, subject to change based on findings at hand at any particular time and reliant on funding which in turn is dependent to some extent on macro-economic conditions and development with regards to the authority and its stakeholders. The five-year program ending in 2021 included activities prior to TMC’s acquisition of TOML in 2020. Although the stated program objectives were not achieved, the ISA accepted TOML’s submission and explanations, and agreed to TOML’s next five-year program of activities. 
On December 23, 2022, the ISA accepted TOML’s proposed program of activities for the 2022-2026 five-year period.
The ISA Council may suspend or terminate the TOML Exploration Contract, without prejudice to any other rights that the ISA may have, if any of the following events occur:

● | if, in spite of written warnings by the ISA, TOML has conducted its activities in such a way that results in serious persistent and willful violations of the fundamental terms of this contract, Part XI of UNCLOS, the 1994 Agreement and the rules, regulations and procedures of the ISA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if TOML has failed to comply with a final binding decision of the dispute settlement body applicable to it;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if TOML becomes insolvent or commits an act of bankruptcy or enters into any agreement for composition with its creditors or goes into liquidation or receivership, whether compulsory or voluntary; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

33




● | petitions or applies to any tribunal for the appointment of a receiver or a trustee for itself or commences any proceedings relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or readjustment of debt law, whether now or hereafter in effect, other than for the purpose of reconstruction.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, if the nationality or control of TOML changes or TOML’s Sponsoring State, as defined in the Regulations, terminates its sponsorship and TOML does not obtain another sponsor meeting the requirements prescribed in the Regulations, then the TOML Exploration Contract will terminate.
The TOML Sponsorship Agreement
On March 8, 2008, Tonga and TOML entered into the TOML Sponsorship Agreement formalizing certain obligations of the parties in relation to TOML’s exploration and potential exploitation of a proposed application to the ISA (subsequently granted) known as the TOML Area. Tonga updated the sponsorship agreement with TOML in September 2021. Unless otherwise terminated by the parties, the term for the TOML Sponsorship Agreement is for the duration of TOML’s ISA Exploration Contract and will automatically extend for a further 25 years upon TOML being granted an ISA Exploitation Contract. Upon reaching the minimum recovery level within the tenement area, TOML has agreed to pay Tonga a seabed mineral recovery payment based on the polymetallic nodules recovered from the tenement area. In addition, TOML will pay an administration fee each year to Tonga for such administration and sponsorship, which is subject to review and increase in the event that TOML is granted an ISA Exploitation Contract. TOML expects to renegotiate the existing sponsorship agreement with Tonga prior to entering into operations in the TOML area and has committed to paying corporate income tax within Tonga.
Marawa Agreements
On March 17, 2012, our wholly-owned subsidiary, DGE, entered into an Option Agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with Marawa and Kiribati. In consideration of the $250,000 option fee, Marawa granted DGE an option to purchase tenements, as may be granted to Marawa by the ISA or any other regulatory body, for $300,000, or in consideration of DGE waiving any loan and other debt obligation pursuant to the Services Agreement (as defined below) if a default event occurs. The exercise period for the option is a maximum of 40 years after the date of the execution of the Option Agreement.
On July 26, 2012, the ISA Council approved a plan of work for exploration submitted by Marawa covering the Marawa Contract Area. Due to uncertainty on the economic potential of the Marawa Contract Area, Marawa is currently considering its options, including potentially seeking a new area. Marawa expects to finalize its decision in 2023. Marawa delayed certain work programs until it determines how it will move forward. 
On October 1, 2013, DGE entered into an agreement (the “Services Agreement”) with the Republic of Kiribati and Marawa granting DGE the exclusive right for 40 years to carry out exploration and collection in the Marawa Contract Area as well as purchase polymetallic nodules collected from the Marawa Contract Area. The Marawa Exploration Contract was signed on January 19, 2015. To date, limited offshore marine resource definition activities in the Marawa Contract Area have occurred. We expect to collaborate with Marawa to assess the viability of any potential project in the Marawa Contract Area, although the timing of such assessment is uncertain. Marawa has delayed certain of its efforts in the Marawa Contract Area while it determines how it will move forward with additional assessment work.
DGE has the right to terminate the Services Agreement for convenience at any time at its election by giving written notice to Marawa and Kiribati and such termination shall take effect two months following the date of the termination notice, provided that DGE shall pay to the ISA on behalf of Marawa the fees or payments legally owed to the ISA by Marawa (including the Annual ISA Exploration Fee and ISA Royalties and Taxes) that are outstanding at the date of termination or that are incurred within 12 months of the date of such termination, provided that Marawa shall have an obligation to minimize such fees and payments to the extent practicable after the date of said termination. DGE and Marawa have considered the potential to amend the current contractual arrangements to provide additional mutual benefits in the conduct of operations, though no assurances may be given that any changes will be agreed.

Royalties and taxes
Royalties and taxes payable on any future production from the CCZ will be stipulated in the ISA’s exploitation regulations. While the rates of payments are yet to be set by the ISA, the 1994 Implementation Agreement (Section 8(1)(b)) prescribes that the rates of payments “shall be within the range of those prevailing in respect of land-based mining of the same or similar minerals in order to avoid giving deep seabed miners an artificial competitive advantage or imposing on them a competitive disadvantage.”
An open-ended working group has met several times including most recently in October / November 2022 to discuss potential royalty and taxation regimes supported by modelling conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. No final recommendations were made. However, a 2% ad valorem royalty increasing to 6% after a period of five years of production was discussed as well as a 1% ad valorem environmental levy. These amounts were used for the economic analysis included in the initial assessment contained in the NORI Technical Report Summary. Additional discussions have considered capping any proposed environmental levy once an agreed total value has been reached and might no longer be collected once sufficient funds are in trust. We can provide no assurances that any such royalties or levies will not be greater than those discussed and could be significantly greater. 
Under the NORI Sponsorship Agreement between Nauru and NORI and under the TOML Sponsorship Agreement between Tonga and TOML, upon reaching a minimum recovery level within the tenement areas, NORI and TOML have agreed to pay Nauru and Tonga a seabed mineral recovery payment for polymetallic nodules recovered from the tenement area, annually adjusted (from year 5) on a compounding basis based on the official inflation rate in the United States. In addition, NORI and TOML will pay an administration fee each year to Nauru and Tonga for such administration and sponsorship, which is subject to review and increase in the event that NORI or TOML are granted an ISA Exploitation Contract. NORI and TOML have both committed to paying corporate income tax within Nauru and Tonga, respectively.
Environmental Regulation
On March 4, 2023 the United Nations finalized the UN High Seas Treaty. The treaty does not replace or amend UNCLOS, or the authority of the ISA, and must be interpreted consistently with the rights granted by the Convention.
The ISA is mandated through UNCLOS to “preserve and protect the marine environment” while developing the resources within the Area. Given the location of the NORI Contract Area, the ISA is responsible for assessing any ESIA prepared by NORI and for granting the relevant permits.
The ISA has issued Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules (adopted on July 13, 2000, updated on July 25, 2013). The regulations are complemented by the LTC’s recommendations for the guidance of contractors on assessing the environmental impacts of exploration. The exploitation regulations on deep-seabed collection will be complemented by various standards and guidelines. The ISA is currently developing these Standards and Guidelines which are expected to be finalized by the LTC and adopted by the Council. The ISA has divided the required standards and guidelines in three phases.

● | Phase 1: Standards and guidelines deemed necessary to be in place by the time of adoption of the draft regulations on exploitation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: Standards and guidelines deemed necessary to be in place prior to the receipt of an application of a plan of work for exploitation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

35




● | Phase 3: Standards and guidelines deemed necessary to be in place before commercial mining activities commence in the Area.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
​
Ten standards and guidelines have been prepared in Phase 1, provided to stakeholders for comment, reviewed and amended by the LTC and provided to Council for consideration and approval. Additional standards and guidelines will be drafted as part of the development of Phase 2 in 2022 for stakeholder comment and review. After drafting by the LTC, the standards and guidelines will be provided to the Council for review and adoption.
Although the environmental impact review process has not yet been finalized, all contractors have been made aware that the ISA requires the completion of baseline studies and EIA, culminating in an EIS for proposed commercial operations, prior to collection. Guidance for contractors in terms of what will be expected in the EIS has been provided in ISA Technical Study No. 10 (ISA 2012a). The EIS, along with an EMMP, will be required as part of the application for an ISA Exploitation Contract for operations in the CCZ. Environmental impacts of exploration and potential collection activities have been studied, and NORI is working with several of the deep-sea research institutions that are contributing to our environmental and social impact assessment program, consisting of over 100 discrete studies.
NORI’s offshore exploration campaigns have included sampling to support environmental studies, collection of high-resolution imagery, full column physical and chemical oceanographic data and environmental baseline studies. All offshore campaigns to support environmental baseline data collection have been completed. An integrated collector test involving trialing of collector vehicle and riser system took place in 2022. A key objective of this test was to monitor the environmental impact of the collection system and use these data to forecast the impacts for a full-scale commercial operation. NORI intends to manage the project under the governance of an environmental management system (“EMS”), which is to be developed in accordance with the international EMS standard, ISO 14001:2004. The EMS will provide the overall framework for the environmental management and monitoring plans that will be required.
NORI’s EMMP will specify the objectives and purpose of all monitoring requirements, the components to be monitored, frequency of monitoring, methods of monitoring, analysis required in each monitoring component, monitoring data management and reporting. The EMMP will be submitted to the ISA as part of the ISA Exploitation Contract application.
Pursuant to Article 165(2)(b) of the Convention and Paragraph 11(a) of the 1994 Agreement, an application for a Plan of Work is first reviewed by the LTC and a recommendation concerning the approval of the Plan of Work is submitted by the LTC to the Council. Rule 44 of the Commission’s Rules of Procedure requires decision making by consensus. If all efforts to reach consensus have been exhausted, however, then a decision by voting shall be taken by a majority of members present and voting. A proposed timeline for the consideration of a Plan of Work by the Commission was developed in “Draft guideline on the preparation and assessment of an application for the approval of a Plan of Work for exploitation” (ISBA/27/C/3).
If a positive recommendation is submitted by the Commission to the Council concerning the approval of a Plan of Work, the Council is required to approve the Commission’s recommendation unless a two-thirds majority of its members present and voting, including a majority of members present and voting in each of the chambers of the Council, decides to disapprove the Plan of Work. If the Council does not take a decision on the Commission’s recommendation within 60 days, the recommendation shall be deemed to have been approved by the Council.

In addition, the sponsoring State has a responsibility to put in place legislation to ensure the entity it has sponsored complies with UNCLOS and ISA rules and regulations. Nauru implemented the Nauru International Seabed Minerals Act in 2015 which acts as a second layer of legislation with which NORI is required to comply.
To date, NORI’s assessment is that it is in compliance with existing exploration permits and contracts. NORI estimates that it is in the middle stages of the exploitation permitting process. In addition to working on key engineering aspects of the project such as designing the final nodule collector and the dewatering facility, NORI is also continuing the following tasks:

● | delineating nodule mineralization;
--+-----------------------------------


● | characterizing the nature of the seabed, water column and biology;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | conducting environmental baseline studies and impact assessments;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | characterizing the nature of any materials returned to the environment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | developing oceanographic and physical information to inform models (e.g., sediment plume models); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | developing other plans, including the EMMP and the various subordinate plans.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The potential future onshore environmental impacts have not yet been assessed because the processing plant that we expect to create or use through a tolling or other arrangement has not been determined or otherwise has not been designed in sufficient detail, and the location and host country (and hence regulatory regime) has not been confirmed. The planned metallurgical process is expected to generate near-zero solid waste products, and the deleterious elements (for example, cadmium and arsenic) content of the nodules is understood to be very low, indicating that with careful management, the environmental impacts of the processing operation is expected to be low.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection of our core technology and intellectual property, as well as that of our strategic partners, and particularly that our freedom to operate is not restricted by patents lodged by competitors or other third parties. Moreover, we rely on a combination of trade secret protection, non-disclosure and licensing agreements and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary intellectual property. To this end, we maintain a portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications, which relate to offshore collection systems and to the processing of polymetallic nodules for recovering metals. As we rely on a number of patents to establish and protect our intellectual property, we have obtained and filed patent applications in countries throughout North America, Europe and Asia.
We cannot conclusively state that any pending applications, existing or future intellectual property will be definitively useful in protecting or promoting our business and growth plans. Please see the section entitled “Risk Factors” for additional information on the risks associated with our intellectual property strategy and portfolio.

People Engagement. As a company working to pioneer a new industry and new ways of doing things, our success depends on attracting and retaining strong, independent, entrepreneurial, and multi-talented team members capable of dealing with high levels of uncertainty and adversity. Our team is distributed across several continents and several time zones, with remote working being the norm for most of our staff. Despite physical and temporal separation, we maintain a strong sense of cohesion by attracting people who are intrinsically motivated by the company’s purpose and core values, cultivating a flat organizational structure and deep care for each other. We rely on regular management and company meetings, ongoing communication flows across different technology platforms, frequent ad hoc video communication and creating opportunities for in-person gatherings. We offer our team members flexible work schedules and autonomy in managing their time while encouraging them to set boundaries between work on our shared mission and their home lives.
Compensation and Benefits. We compensate our staff competitively, striving to be in the 50th-60th percentile of our peers for total compensation and benefits. In addition to salaries, our compensation and benefits program includes annual discretionary bonuses, equity awards, an employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) contribution/superannuation or RRSP benefit contribution (as applicable jurisdictionally), healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts. Our annual equity compensation is focused on company priorities that we believe create long-term value for our stakeholders.
Environment, Health & Safety (EHS). Our EHS vision is to fully integrate environmental, health and safety into our operations, and to create a workplace free of incidents. In 2022, we have relied on the EHS programs of our partners Allseas and a new offshore support service provider to conduct our operations in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable safety laws, rules and regulations. These all involve EHS systems incorporating thorough planning, risk assessment and disciplined implementation of controls as well as culturally-based safety observations systems like safe act observations and obligation of “stop work if it is unsafe to proceed”.
