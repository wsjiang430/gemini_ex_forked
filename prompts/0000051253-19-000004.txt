ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.

We are a leading innovator of sensory experiences that move the world. We co-create unique products that consumers taste, smell, or touch. Our expanded geographical footprint and product portfolio position us to better serve both our global customers and the growing regional, mid-sized and smaller specialty customers.
 Through the acquisition, of Frutarom we increased our product portfolio with complementary adjacencies, such as natural colors, antioxidants for food preservation, nutraceuticals, ingredients for infant formula and proteins for elderly nutrition, and expanded core product lines with savory solutions aimed at the meat and fish industry, citrus and other naturals flavors, specialty ingredients and new cosmetic actives. As a result, we now have over 90,000 products within our portfolio that are provided to customers in approximately 195 countries, which includes a significant number of faster-growing small and mid-sized customers. 
Prior to our acquisition of Frutarom, we had 37 manufacturing facilities and 21 creative centers and application laboratories, located in 35 different countries. Upon our acquisition of Frutarom, we acquired 60 additional manufacturing facilities and 84 additional R&D/application laboratories globally, including many of the countries in which we currently operate. We currently anticipate that, over time, we will optimize our global facilities footprint as we continue to seek opportunities to efficiently and cost-effectively deliver value to our global customers.
The 2018 combined sales of IFF and Frutarom, which combines the full year 2018 sales of both Frutarom and IFF, was approximately $5.1 billion which, management believes, makes us the second largest company in the taste, scent and nutrition industry. We expect that our combined cultures of innovation and partnership will allow us to further capitalize on this expansion to continue to offer our customers innovative and differentiated products.
 During the past few years, through acquisitions and the development of Tastepoint, we have leveraged our expertise to expand our North American mid-sized customer base. With the acquisition of Frutarom, which was principally focused on serving small and mid-sized companies globally, we have significantly increased our exposure to these faster-growing customers. Based on our 2018 combined sales, approximately 35% of our customers are global consumer products companies while approximately 65% of our customers are small and mid-sized companies.
During 2018, our 25 largest customers accounted for 47% of our sales, however as a result of the effect of the Frutarom acquisition, our 25 largest customers only accounted for 37% of our 2018 combined sales. Similarly, while sales to our largest customer across all end-use categories (which principally arose from our Scent business) accounted for 9% to 12 % of our sales for each of the last three fiscal years, sales to this customer only accounted for 7% of our 2018 combined sales.
Our business is geographically diverse, with sales in the U.S representing approximately 25% of sales in 2018 and no other geographic market representing more than 6% of sales. We believe that more significant future growth potential for the flavors and fragrances industry, and for our business, exists in the emerging markets (which we classify as all markets except North America, Japan, Australia, and Western, Southern and Northern Europe). As a result, we intend to continue to build on our multi-decade experience in the emerging markets. During 2018, sales in emerging markets represented 48% of our 2018 sales. As our customers seek to grow their businesses in emerging markets, we provide them the ability to leverage our long-standing international presence and extensive market knowledge to help drive their brands in these markets.
We operate in three business segments, Taste (previously "Flavors"), Scent (previously "Fragrances") and, commencing upon its acquisition, Frutarom. In 2018, our Taste business represented 44% of our sales, our Scent business represented 47% of sales and Frutarom represented 9% of sales. Based on our 2018 combined sales, our Taste business represented 34% of sales, 
 3

our Scent business represented 36% of sales and Frutarom represented 30% of sales.

Vision 2020 Strategy 
We believe that 2018 was a transformative year as our continued internal growth and our acquisition of Frutarom has delivered successes against all four pillars of our Vision 2020 strategy, which has focused on building differentiation and accelerating growth to create shareholder value:

(1) | Innovating Firsts - We seek to strengthen our position by driving differentiation in priority R&D platforms across both businesses. During 2018, we continued to grow in our Re-Imagine modulation and PowderPure clean label portfolios, developed two new molecules which will be launched in 2019 and continued research into olfactory receptors and maximizing the nutritional value of our naturals. In addition, we opened a naturals laboratory in China, our first outside of the United States, to capitalize on the biodiversity of the region in the development of new products.


(2) | Winning Where We Compete - Our goal is to achieve a #1 or #2 market leadership position in key markets and categories and with specific customers. In our Taste business, our Tastepoint initiative showed strong improvement, while our Scent business continued to achieve new wins.


(3) | Becoming Our Customers' Partner of Choice - Our goal is to attain commercial excellence by providing our customers with in-depth, local consumer understanding, industry-leading innovation, outstanding service and the highest quality products. During 2018, we continued to reflect our customers’ focus on naturals and environmental sustainability as IFF-LMR Naturals increased the number of our organic certified sites and have received the Expertise Vegan Europe (EVE) Vegan certification for a portfolio of 90 of our natural extracts. Consumers, and therefore our customers, are continuing to focus on sensorial products that are responsibly sourced. Consequently, an integral component of this pillar is our ongoing commitment to sustainability and in 2018, our efforts in this area led us to be named one of Barron’s 100 Most Sustainable Companies.


(4) | Strengthening and Expanding the Portfolio - We actively pursue value-creation through partnerships, collaborations, and acquisitions within Taste, Scent, Frutarom and adjacencies. We prioritize opportunities that provide (i) access to new technologies, (ii) the ability to increase our market share in key markets and with key customers or (iii) access to adjacent products or services that will position us to leverage our expertise in science and technology and our customer base. In addition to significantly expanding our customer base into the faster-growing midsize and smaller companies, the Frutarom acquisition allowed us to expand our cosmetic active ingredients business and enter into the attractive adjacent markets of savory solutions, natural colors, natural food protection and health and wellness products, including nutraceuticals and enzymes.

Our Product Offerings
Fragrances
Our fragrance business derives revenue from two sources, Fragrance Compounds and Ingredients. We are a global leader in the creation of fragrance compounds that are integral elements in the world’s finest perfumes and best-known consumer products, within fabric care, home care, personal wash, hair care and toiletries. Our Fragrance Ingredients business is a vertically integrated operation, originating with the development in our research laboratories of naturals, synthetic and proprietary molecules and innovative delivery systems, progressing to our manufacturing facilities that produce these ingredients in a consistent, high-quality and cost-effective manner and transitioning to our creative centers and application laboratories where our perfumers partner with our customers to create unique fragrance compounds for use in a variety of end-use products. We also produce cosmetic active and functional ingredients for use in cosmetics.
By providing our fragrance development teams with an extensive portfolio of innovative, high-quality and effective ingredients to support their creativity, we are able to provide our customers with a unique identity for their brands. These ingredients or fragrance compounds can then be combined with our innovative delivery systems, including our proprietary encapsulation technology, which consists of individual fragrance droplets coated with a protective polymeric shell to deliver superior fragrance performance throughout a product's lifecycle. These delivery systems are key differentiators in the growth of our consumer fragrance compounds.
 4

Fragrance Compounds. Fragrance Compounds are unique and proprietary combinations of multiple ingredients that are ultimately used by our customers in their consumer goods. Our creative and commercial teams within Fragrance Compounds are organized into two broad categories, Fine Fragrances and Consumer Fragrances.
Fine Fragrances. Fine Fragrances focuses on perfumes and colognes. IFF’s scientists and perfumers collaborate to develop new molecules, new natural extractions, and innovative processes that enliven perfumers' palettes and help them create unique, inspiring fragrances. We have created some of the industry-leading fine fragrance classics as well as cutting-edge niche fragrances, as evidenced by the number of top sellers.
Consumer Fragrances. Our Consumer Fragrances include five end-use categories of products: 

i. | Fabric Care - laundry detergents, fabric softeners and specialty laundry products;


ii. | Home Care - household cleaners, dishwashing detergents and air fresheners;


iii. | Personal Wash, including bar soap and shower gel;


iv. | Hair Care; and


v. | Toiletries.

Ingredients. Fragrance Ingredients consists of active and functional ingredients that are used internally and sold to third parties, including customers and competitors, for use in preparation of compounds. While the principal role of our Fragrance Ingredients facilities is to support our Fragrance Compounds business, we utilize our excess manufacturing capacity to manufacture and sell certain Fragrance Ingredients to third parties. We believe that this business allows us to leverage our fixed costs while maintaining the security of supply for our perfumers and ultimately our customers. Fragrance Ingredients available for sale to third parties include innovative ingredients that leverage our manufacturing experience as well as a limited amount of cost-competitive, commodity ingredients. As our Fragrance Compounds business grows, we expect that the percentage of capacity allocated to the production of Fragrance Ingredients for sale to third parties may decrease. Fragrance Ingredients also includes our cosmetic active and functional ingredients, which provide biologists and cosmetic chemists with innovative solutions to address cosmetic challenges such as skin aging and hair protection.
With approximately 1,300 separate fragrance and active and functional ingredients, plus additional botanicals and delivery systems, we believe we are a leader in the industry with the breadth of our product portfolio.
Consistent with our Vision 2020 strategy, our fragrance business continues to build upon our strengths to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, address evolving consumer demands and deliver accelerated growth. Specifically, we intend to focus on:

• | Delivery Systems. We continue to invest in our delivery system technologies, including expansion of our market-leading encapsulation technology, which we believe will allow us to differentiate our products and those of our customers. Our encapsulation technology extends, controls the release of and increases aromas in a variety of consumer products. We have expanded our portfolio to offer multi-functional delivery systems with cosmetic actives that work to enhance skin penetration, protect the cosmetic active ingredients against interactions with other ingredients, provide long-lasting release, facilitate formulation of challenging ingredients and allow a better-targeted action.


• | Consumer Demand for Natural and Organic Products. Increased demand for natural ingredients is a primary driver of future growth in Fine Fragrances. We believe that our in-house naturals operations, led by Laboratoire Monique Rémy (“LMR”) in Grasse, France, are industry leading in the processing of quality materials and offer decades of experience understanding natural products and perfecting the process of transforming naturals, such as narcissus, jasmine and blackcurrant bud, into pure absolutes that retain the unique fragrance of their origin. Our objective is to expand our naturals capabilities by offering our clients natural and proprietary ingredients.


• | Transparency in Labeling. As consumers worldwide seek to require transparency in labeling, our customers will progressively seek to differentiate their products through the inclusion of a natural ingredients and proprietary molecules. We believe our focus on innovation, including innovative delivery systems and our natural and proprietary ingredients will help our customers address these changing consumer demand.

Flavors
Our flavors business is focused on building upon our strengths with flavors and focusing on addressing industry trends that will allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and deliver accelerated growth consistent with our Vision 
 5

2020 strategy. The trends driving these growth opportunities include:
Continued Consumer Demand for Fresh, Clean and Authentic Products. Consumers are increasingly demanding that their food and beverage products contain natural and organic ingredients and possess dietary and nutritional value (reduced fat, salt, sugar, etc.). Based on these demands, natural food and beverage products are increasingly perceived by consumers as being of higher quality, healthier and more environmentally friendly. To ensure that they understand the quality of these products, consumers, non-governmental organizations and governmental agencies are seeking more transparency in product labeling. In response, many of our customers are announcing initiatives to provide “clean label” products (products that do not include any artificial ingredients). We believe our Vision 2020 strategy’s focus on innovation, including our modulation technology, delivery systems and our naturals and proprietary ingredients will help our customers address these changing consumer demands.
Expansion of Consumer Food Companies. The number of participants in the food industry continues to expand, with mid-sized regional companies and companies focused on niche-product categories joining the traditional global companies to drive and accelerate product innovation. Consequently, larger food and beverage companies are seeing slower growth than in previous years. To be responsive to these developments, we created Tastepoint by IFF, representing the collaboration of Ottens Flavors and David Michael, which primarily services mid-sized customers in North America by providing the approach of a smaller company, backed by expertise traditionally reserved for companies with a more global reach. Through our acquisition of Frutarom, we have added approximately 39,000 small and mid-sized customers. We intend to continue to look for innovative and value-creating methods for serving this growing customer base. 
Flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste experiences in food and beverage products and, as such, play a significant role in determining consumer preference for the end products in which they are used. As a leading creator of Flavor Compounds, we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers. While we are a global leader, our flavors business is more regional in nature, with different formulas that reflect local taste preferences. Consequently, we manage our flavors business geographically, creating Flavor Compounds in our regional creative centers which allow us to satisfy local taste preferences, while also helping to ensure regulatory compliance and production standards. We develop thousands of different flavors and taste offerings for our customers, most of which are tailor-made. We continually develop new formulas to meet changing consumer preferences and customer needs.
Our Flavor Compounds are ultimately used by our customers in the following four end-use categories of consumer goods: 

i. | Savory, for use in soups, sauces, condiments, prepared meals, meat, fish and poultry, potato chips and other savory snacks;


ii. | Beverages, for use in juice drinks, carbonated beverages, flavored waters and spirits;


iii. | Sweet, for use in bakery products, candy, chewing gum and cereal; and


iv. | Dairy, for use in all dairy products such as yogurt, ice cream and cheese and other products that have a creamy flavor.

Our Frutarom business creates and manufactures a naturals-focused suite of Flavor Compounds and specialty fine ingredients, largely targeting small, local and regional customers. Our Frutarom business seeks to capitalize on the health and wellness focus of consumers and deliver growth by offering customers natural flavor products that combine solutions to create natural colors and natural functional food ingredients, which promote health benefits and extend shelf life. Based on this historical concentration, the majority of Frutarom's raw materials and products come from natural sources.
Frutarom’s products are focused on three principal areas:

(1) | Savory Solutions - Savory Solutions are blends of flavors, natural colors, seasonings, functional ingredients and natural anti-oxidants that are primarily designed for the meat and fish industry. Savory Solutions are inherently very market specific reflecting the taste and historic focus of each region. Through acquisitions and product development, Frutarom has developed an extensive product portfolio that seeks to address these customer needs.


(2) | Natural Product Solutions - Natural Product Solutions include the use of natural health ingredients, colors and shelf life extenders.


a. | Natural Health Ingredients - Natural functional food and supplement nutraceutical ingredients are derived from plants and herbs, which provide, or are perceived as providing, health benefits. In addition, these ingredients are used in dietary supplements, infant and elderly nutrition, cosmetics

 6

and personal care. 

b. | Natural Color - Wide array of natural colors and fruit and vegetable concentrates for food, beverage, and cosmetics.


c. | Natural Food Protection - Natural antioxidants and anti-microbials used for natural food preservation and shelf life extension to beverages, cosmetic and healthcare products, and pet food and feed additives. These ingredients reduce the oxidative deterioration that leads to rancidity or loss of flavor, color, and nutritional value.


(3) | Taste Solutions - Flavor compounds and foods.


(4) | Specialty Fine Ingredients - specialty fine ingredients market include natural flavor extracts, specialty essential oils, citrus products, aromatic chemicals, and natural gums and resins. Fine ingredients are used for food, beverage, flavors and fragrances, and are often sold directly to food and beverage manufacturers who use them in producing consumer products. Flavor and fragrance manufacturers use fine ingredients products as a foundation in producing their flavor and fragrance substances.

Research and Product Development Process
Consumer Insights 
We believe that the first step to creating an innovative and unique flavor or fragrance experience begins with gaining insight into the consumer. By developing a deep understanding of what consumers value and prefer, we are better able to focus our R&D and creative efforts. 
Our consumer insight and marketing teams interpret trends, monitor product launches, analyze quantitative market data, and conduct numerous consumer interviews annually. Our sensory experts direct research programs exploring topics such as fragrance performance, the psychophysics of sensory perception (including chemesthetic properties such as warming, cooling, and tingling), the genetic basis for flavor and fragrance preference, and the effects of aromas on mood, performance, health, and well-being.
Based on this information, we develop innovative programs to evaluate potential products that enable us to understand the emotional connections between a prospective product and the consumer. We believe this ability to pinpoint the likelihood of a product’s success translates into stronger brand equity, resulting in increased returns and greater market share gains for our customers as well as IFF.
Research and Development
We consider our R&D infrastructure to be one of our key competencies and we focus and invest substantial resources in the research and development of new and innovative molecules, compounds, formulas and technologies and the application of these to our customers’ products. We spend approximately 8% of our sales on the research, development and implementation of new molecules, compounds and technologies that help our customers respond to changing consumer preferences. Using the knowledge gained from our Consumer Insights program, we strategically focus our resources around key R&D platforms that address consumer needs or preferences, or anticipate future preferences. By aligning our resources around these platforms, we ensure the proper support and focus for each program so that it can be further developed and eventually accepted for commercial application. 
We currently have 392 patents in the United States, including those we have acquired from Frutarom and our other transactions. In addition, we have developed many unique molecules and delivery systems for our customers that are used as the foundations of successful flavors and fragrances around the world.
We have traditionally conducted our principal R&D activities in Union Beach, New Jersey, where we employ scientists and application engineers who collaborate with our other R&D centers around the world, to support the:

• | discovery of new materials;


• | development of new technologies, such as delivery systems;


• | creation of new compounds; and


• | enhancement of existing ingredients and compounds.

 7

As of December 31, 2018, we employed about 2,300 people globally in R&D activities, including 568 in our recently acquired Frutarom business. We spent $311.6 million, $295.5 million and $258.9 million, or approximately 7.8%, 8.7% and 8.3% of sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, on R&D activities. While we have historically spent approximately 8% of sales on R&D activities, based on the significantly increased sales resulting from the Frutarom acquisition we expect that that percentage will decrease during 2019.
Our ingredients research program discovers molecules found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are subsequently tested for their sensorial value. To broaden our offerings of natural, innovative and unique products, we seek collaborations with research institutions and other companies throughout the world. We have established a number of such collaborations to strengthen our innovation pipeline. We may also consider acquiring companies that could provide access to new technologies, consistent with our Vision 2020 strategy. 
The development of new and customized flavor and fragrance compounds is a complex process calling upon the combined knowledge of our scientists, flavorists and perfumers. Scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with flavorists and perfumers to develop flavor and fragrance compounds with consumer preferred performance characteristics. The development of new flavor and fragrance compounds requires (i) an in-depth knowledge of the flavor and fragrance characteristics of the various ingredients we use, (ii) an understanding of how the many ingredients in a consumer product interact and (iii) the creation of controlled release and delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance. To facilitate this process, we have a scientific advisory board that provides external perspectives and independent feedback on our R&D and sustainability initiatives.
In 2017, we launched Re-Imagine, a multi-tiered program to accelerate innovation and increase agility to capture unmet opportunities in the changing food and beverage market. Based on a combination of future trends analysis, consumer insights, and a modernized cross-category development process, the program guides our research and development efforts to ensure an innovation pipeline that addresses evolving consumer needs and desires.
Creative Application 
We also have a network of 21 creative centers and application laboratories, including 84 acquired in the Frutarom transaction, around the world where we create or adapt the basic flavors or fragrances compounds that we have developed in the R&D process to commercialize for use in our customers’ consumer products. Our global creative teams consist of perfumers, fragrance evaluators and flavorists, as well as marketing, consumer insights and technical application experts, from a wide range of cultures and nationalities. In close partnership with our customers’ product development groups, our creative teams create the sensory experiences that our customers are seeking in order to satisfy consumer demands in each of their markets.
Development of new flavors and fragrances is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers, who are in need of a specific flavors and fragrances for use in a new or modified consumer product, or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our Consumer Insights program. Our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavors and fragrances. A collaborative process between our researchers, our product development team and our customers then follows to perfect the flavors and fragrances so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product.
In addition to creating new flavors and fragrances, our researchers and product development teams advise customers on ways to improve their existing products by adjusting or substituting current ingredients with more readily accessible or less expensive materials or by modifying the current ingredients to produce an enhanced yield. This often results in creating a better value proposition for our customers.
Our flavors and fragrances compound formulas are treated as trade secrets and remain our proprietary asset. Our business is not materially dependent upon any individual patent, trademark or license.
Supply Chain
We strive to provide our customers with consistent quality products on a timely and cost-effective basis by managing all aspects of the supply chain, from raw material sourcing through manufacturing, quality assurance, regulatory compliance and distribution.
Procurement
In connection with the manufacture of compounds, we use natural ingredients and, primarily in our fragrance compounds, synthetic ingredients. We purchase approximately 21,000 different raw materials from about 6,000 domestic and international suppliers and distributors. 
 8

The vast majority of Frutarom's raw materials and products come from natural sources. With the acquisition of Frutarom we significantly increased our natural products and therefore we expect that the percentage of our ingredients that are natural or crop-related has increased. Natural ingredients are derived from flowers, fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal products. They contain varying numbers of organic chemicals that are responsible for the fragrance or flavor of the natural product. Natural products are purchased in processed or semi-processed form. Some are used in compounds in the state in which they are purchased and others are used after further processing. Natural products, together with various chemicals, are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes. Our flavor products also include extracts and seasonings derived from various fruits, vegetables, nuts, herbs and spices as well as microbiologically-derived ingredients. 
In order to ensure our supply of raw materials, achieve favorable pricing and provide timely transparency regarding inflationary trends to our customers, we continue to be focused on (i) implementing a forward-buy strategy, (ii) entering into supplier relationships to gain access to supplies that we do not have, (iii) implementing indexed pricing, (iv) reducing the complexity of our formulations and (v) evaluating whether it is more profitable to buy or make an ingredient. We are also concentrating on local country sourcing with our own procurement professionals.
Manufacturing and Distribution
Prior to our acquisition of Frutarom, we had 37 manufacturing facilities and 21 creative centers and application laboratories, located in 35 different countries. Our major manufacturing facilities have been located in the United States, the Netherlands, Spain, Great Britain, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, China, India, and Singapore. Based on the regional nature of the Taste business and the concerns regarding the fragile nature of transporting raw materials, we have typically established smaller manufacturing facilities in our local markets that are focused on local needs. Products within the Scent business are typically composed of compounds that are more stable and more transportable around the world. Consequently, we have fewer manufacturing facilities within our Scent business, which produce compounds and ingredients for global distribution.
As part of our acquisition of Frutarom, we acquired their 60 manufacturing facilities. In addition, we
acquired 84 additional creative centers and application laboratories globally, including many of the countries in
which we currently operate. We currently anticipate that, over time, we will optimize our global facilities footprint
to efficiently and cost-effectively deliver value to our global customers.
Our supply chain initiatives in developing markets are focused on increasing capacity and investments in key technologies. Within our more mature markets, we tend to focus on consolidation and cost optimization as well as implementing new technologies. In addition to our own manufacturing facilities, we develop relationships with third parties, including contract manufacturing organizations that permit us to expand access to the technologies, capabilities and capacity that we need to better serve our customers.
In 2018, we continued to invest in our facilities. We opened two new facilities in China, a flavors manufacturing facility in the Zhangjiagang Free Trade Zone and a Natural Product Research lab, located in the Nanjing Life Science Park and broke ground on a new Flavors and Fragrances plant in India.
Sustainability
Over the past several years, we have redefined the way we envision sustainability. Moving from the traditional “take-make-dispose” model, we have embraced the circular economy model - one that is restorative and regenerative by design, which we believe is key in safeguarding the wellbeing of our consumers, the health of our planet and the integrity of our business. 
Our sustainability strategy is centered on three main platforms: Positive Principles, Regenerative Products and Sensational People and is a key enabler of our overall Vision 2020 business strategy.

• | Positive Principles - We seek to embed the principles of eliminating the concept of waste, using clean renewable energy, and celebrating diversity into our company and culture.


• | Regenerative Products - We strive to intentionally design our products to continuously support well-being and have a positive contribution to society and the environment in a circular economy.


• | Sensational People - We seek to engage our employees and stakeholders to make a positive difference in the world.

In 2018, IFF was named to Barron’s 100 Most Sustainable Companies, the FTSE4Good Index Series and the Euronext Vigeo World 120. Additional achievements included:
 9


• | After surpassing three of our four 2020 environmental targets, we launched new environmental goals focused on science based emission reductions, zero waste to landfill and water stewardship - an initiative known collectively as “EcoEffective+”;


• | Enhancing our tools and processes to incorporate the five aspects of circular design - material health, material recirculation, renewable energy, water and waste minimization, and responsible sourcing - in the very early stages of product development; and


• | Obtaining FairWild certification for Peru Balsam - the first ever FairWild-certified flavor and fragrance ingredient that is commercially available globally. In addition, we have a robust slate of For Life-certified ingredients. The FairWild and For Life certification systems encompass fair working conditions, transparent administration, good community relations and environmental performance monitoring.

For more detailed information about our sustainability programs and performance, refer to our annual sustainability report.
Governmental Regulation
We develop, produce and market our products in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to federal, regional and local legislation and regulations in each of the various countries. Our flavor and many of our fragrance products are intended for the food, beverage and pharmaceutical industries, which are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards. As a result, we are required to meet these strict standards which, in recent years, have become increasingly stringent.
Our products and operations are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in each of the markets in which we operate. These agencies include (1) the Food and Drug Administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate flavors and other ingredients in consumer products, (2) the Environmental Protection Agency and equivalent international agencies that regulate our manufacturing facilities, (3) the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the working conditions in our manufacturing, research laboratories and creative centers, (4) local and international agencies that regulate trade and customs, (5) the Drug Enforcement Administration and other local or international agencies that regulate controlled chemicals that we use in our operations and (6) the Chemical Registration/Notification authorities that regulate chemicals that we use in, or transport to, the various countries in which we manufacture and/or market our products. We have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries, such as Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH") regulations in the European Union.
In addition, we are subject to various rules relating to health, work safety and the environment at the local and international levels in the various countries in which we operate. Our manufacturing facilities throughout the world are subject to environmental standards relating to air emissions, sewage discharges, the use of hazardous materials, waste disposal practices and clean-up of existing environmental contamination. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards, and the costs of compliance have risen significantly, a trend we expect will continue in the future.
Competition
The markets for flavors, fragrances and specialty ingredients are part of a larger market that supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds used in consumer products. The broader market includes functional foods and food additives, including seasonings, texturizers, spices, enzymes, certain food-related commodities, and fortified products as well as nutritional ingredients and supplements and active cosmetic ingredients.
The global market for flavors and fragrances has expanded consistently, primarily as a result of an increase in demand for, and an increase in the variety of, consumer products containing flavors and fragrances.
The market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive. Based on annual sales, our main competitors consist of (1) the three other large global flavor and fragrance manufacturers, Givaudan, Firmenich and Symrise, (2) mid-sized companies, (3) numerous local and regional manufacturers and (4) consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors or fragrances.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the flavors and fragrances sub-market is based on:

i. | our in-depth understanding of consumers,


ii. | innovation and technological advances from our perfumers, flavorists and research and development

 10

activities,

iii. | ability to tailor products to customer's needs, efficiency, product quality and


iv. | broad-based regulatory capabilities.

Large multi-national customers and, increasingly, mid-sized customers, may limit the number of their suppliers by placing some on “core lists,” giving them priority for development and production of their new or modified products.
To compete more successfully in this environment, we must make continued investments in customer relationships and tailor our research and development efforts to anticipate customers’ needs, provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists.”
Private label manufacturers, mostly medium-sized, local or small food manufacturers, constitute a growing segment in the flavor market. Over the last decade, with the strengthening of supermarket chains and growing consumer price consciousness, demand and consumption of private label products has grown at a faster rate than the brand food industry rate. We believe that new business opportunities will continue to arise from these clients as they are increasing demanding products that are similar to existing products in the market, distinctive premium products, as well as more innovative products.
The global demand for functional foods, food additives, nutritional ingredients and supplements and active cosmetic ingredients is also increasing. With our recent acquisitions, we have expanded our offerings to include products with the functional food ingredient market, including ingredients focused on improving the health and wellness characteristics of a consumer good, the nutritional supplement market and the cosmetic actives markets. While the three other large global flavor and fragrance manufacturers, Givaudan, Firmenich and Symrise, are growing their business in these areas, we also compete with specialty chemical companies, other large multi-national companies and smaller regional and local participants that offer products that address these same needs.
Employee Relations
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 13,000 employees worldwide, of whom approximately 2,100 are employed in the United States. We believe that relations with our employees are good.
