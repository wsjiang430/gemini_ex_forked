ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Strategic Realty Trust, Inc., is a Maryland corporation formed on September 18, 2008 to invest in and manage a portfolio of income-producing retail properties, located in the United States, real estate-owning entities and real estate-related assets, including the investment in or origination of mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans related to commercial real estate. We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2009. As used herein, the terms “we” “our” “us” and “Company” refer to Strategic Realty Trust, Inc., and, as required by context, Strategic Realty Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as our “operating partnership” or “OP”, and to their respective subsidiaries. References to “shares” and “our common stock” refer to the shares of our common stock. We own substantially all of our assets and conduct our operations through our operating partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We also own a majority of the outstanding limited partner interests in the operating partnership.
On November 4, 2008, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to offer a maximum of 100,000,000 shares of our common stock to the public in our primary offering at $10.00 per share and up to 10,526,316 shares of our common stock to our stockholders at $9.50 per share pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) (collectively, the “Offering”). On August 7, 2009, the SEC declared the registration statement effective and we commenced the Offering. On February 7, 2013, we terminated the Offering and ceased offering shares of common stock in the primary offering and under the DRIP.
As of February 2013 when we terminated the Offering, we had accepted subscriptions for, and issued, 10,688,940 shares of common stock in the Offering for gross offering proceeds of approximately $104.7 million, and 391,182 shares of common stock pursuant to the DRIP for gross offering proceeds of approximately $3.6 million. We have also granted 50,000 shares of restricted stock and we issued 273,729 shares of common stock to pay a portion of a special distribution on November 4, 2015.
On April 1, 2015, our board of directors approved the reinstatement of the share redemption program and adopted the Amended and Restated Share Redemption Program (the “SRP”). The program was previously suspended, effective as of January 15, 2013. Under the SRP, only shares submitted for repurchase in connection with the death or “qualifying disability” (as defined in the SRP) of a stockholder are eligible for repurchase by us. For more information regarding our share redemption program, refer to Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Share Redemption Program.” Cumulatively, through December 31, 2018, pursuant to the Original Share Redemption Program and the SRP, we have redeemed 737,255 shares of common stock sold in the Offering and/or the DRIP for approximately $5.3 million.
Since our inception, our business has been managed by an external advisor. We do not have direct employees and all management and administrative personnel responsible for conducting our business are employed by our advisor. Currently we are externally managed and advised by SRT Advisor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Advisor”) pursuant to an advisory agreement with the Advisor (the “Advisory Agreement”) initially executed on August 10, 2013, and subsequently renewed every year through 2018. The current term of the Advisory Agreement terminates on August 10, 2019. The Advisor is an affiliate of Glenborough, LLC (together with its affiliates, “Glenborough”), a privately held full-service real estate investment and management company focused on the acquisition, management and leasing of commercial properties.
Our office is located at 66 Bovet Road, Suite 100, San Mateo, California 94402, and our main telephone number is (650) 343-9300.
Investment Objectives
Our investment objectives are to:

• | preserve, protect and return stockholders’ capital contributions;


• | pay predictable and sustainable cash distributions to stockholders; and


• | realize capital appreciation upon the ultimate sale of the real estate assets.

Business Strategy
On February 7, 2013, as a result of the termination of the Offering, we ceased offering shares of our common stock in our primary offering and under our DRIP. Additionally, in March 2013, we filed an application with the SEC to withdraw our registration statement on Form S-11 for a contemplated follow-on public offering of our common stock. Prior to the termination 
4

of the Offering, we funded our investments in real properties and other real-estate related assets primarily with the proceeds from the Offering and debt financing. Since the termination of the Offering, we intend to fund our future cash needs, including any future investments, with debt financing, cash from operations, proceeds to us from asset sales, cash flows from investments in joint ventures and the proceeds from any offerings of our securities that we may conduct in the future. As a result of the termination of the Offering and the resulting decrease in our capital resources, we expect our investment activity to be reduced until we are able to engage in an offering of our securities or are able to identify other significant sources of financing.
We intend to continue to focus on investments in income-producing retail properties. Specifically, we are focused on acquiring high quality urban retail properties in major west coast markets and building a joint venture platform with institutional investors to invest in value–add retail properties. Our investments may include urban store front retail buildings, free standing single tenant buildings, neighborhood, community, power and lifestyle shopping centers, and multi-tenant shopping centers. We may also invest in real estate loans or real estate-related assets that we believe meet our investment objectives. Our near term goal continues to be the recycling of the portfolio that was held in 2013 when the Advisor first began providing services to us pursuant to the Advisory Agreement by selling the remaining legacy properties. As of December 31, 2018, Topaz Marketplace and Shops at Turkey Creek remained the only legacy properties in the portfolio. We believe that a fully recycled and focused high-quality west coast urban retail portfolio will allow us the opportunity to look at various strategic options in the future.
Investment Portfolio
As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included eight properties, which we refer to as “our properties” or “our portfolio,” comprising an aggregate of approximately 86,000 square feet of single and multi-tenant commercial retail space located in two states, which we purchased for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $51.5 million. Refer to Item 2, “Properties” for additional information on our portfolio. In addition to the properties, in 2015 we invested in two joint ventures with an institutional partner. These ventures acquired two portfolios comprising 19 properties and approximately 1,447,000 square feet. As of December 31, 2018, these ventures own in aggregate, five properties, comprising an aggregate of approximately 494,000 square feet and located in three states. During the first quarter of 2016, we invested, through joint ventures, in two significant retail projects under development that are expected to be completed in June 2019 and January 2021, respectively.
Borrowing Policies
We use, and may continue to use in the future, secured and unsecured debt as a means of providing additional funds for the acquisition of real property, real estate-related loans, and other real estate-related assets. Our use of leverage increases the risk of default on loan payments and the resulting foreclosure on a particular asset. In addition, lenders may have recourse to assets other than those specifically securing the repayment of our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018, our aggregate outstanding indebtedness, including deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled approximately $34.5 million, or 36.5% of the book value of our total assets.
Our aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, are reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. Under our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, as amended, which we refer to as our “charter,” we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets. Net assets for purposes of this calculation is defined to be our total assets (other than intangibles), valued at cost prior to deducting depreciation, reserves for bad debts and other non-cash reserves, less total liabilities. The preceding calculation is generally expected to approximate 75% of the aggregate cost of our assets before non-cash reserves and depreciation. However, we may temporarily borrow in excess of these amounts if such excess is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report, along with an explanation for such excess. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our borrowings were approximately 57.5% and 93.0%, respectively, of the book value of our net assets.
Our Advisor uses its best efforts to obtain financing on the most favorable terms available to us and will seek to refinance assets during the term of a loan only in limited circumstances, such as when a decline in interest rates makes it beneficial to prepay an existing loan, when an existing loan matures or if an attractive investment becomes available and the proceeds from the refinancing can be used to purchase such an investment. The benefits of any such refinancing may include increased cash flow resulting from reduced debt service requirements, an increase in distributions from proceeds of the refinancing and an increase in diversification and assets owned if all or a portion of the refinancing proceeds are reinvested.
Economic Dependency
We are dependent on our Advisor and its affiliates for certain services that are essential to us, including the disposition of real estate and real estate-related investments and, to the extent we acquire additional assets, the identification, evaluation, negotiation and purchase of these assets, management of the daily operations of our real estate and real estate-related 
5

investment portfolio, and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that our Advisor is unable to provide such services to us, we will be required to obtain such services from other sources.
Competitive Market Factors
To the extent that we acquire additional real estate investments in the future, we will be subject to significant competition in seeking real estate investments and tenants. We compete with many third-parties engaged in real estate investment activities, including other REITs, other real estate limited partnerships, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, hedge funds, governmental bodies, and other entities. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may have substantially more operating experience than us. The marketplace for real estate equity and financing can be volatile.  There is no guarantee that in the future we will be able to obtain financing or additional equity on favorable terms, if at all. Lack of available financing or additional equity could result in a further reduction of suitable investment opportunities and create a competitive advantage for other entities that have greater financial resources than we do.
Tax Status
We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2009. We believe we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on our taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders, provided that distributions to our stockholders equal at least 90% of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year without the benefit of certain relief provisions, we will be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. We may also be subject to certain state or local income taxes, or franchise taxes.
We have elected to treat one of our subsidiaries as a taxable REIT subsidiary, which we refer to as a TRS. In general, a TRS may engage in any real estate business and certain non-real estate businesses, subject to certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes.
Environmental Matters
All real property investments and the operations conducted in connection with such investments are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on customers, owners or operators for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties, regardless of fault or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal.
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on a real property. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, the presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell, rent or pledge such real property as collateral for future borrowings. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which real property may be used or businesses may be operated. Some of these laws and regulations have been amended so as to require compliance with new or more stringent standards as of future dates. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws may require us to incur material expenditures or may impose material environmental liability. Additionally, tenants’ operations, the existing condition of land when we buy it, operations in the vicinity of our real properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, or activities of unrelated third-parties may affect our real properties. There are also various local, state and federal fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations with which we may be required to comply and which may subject us to liability in the form of fines or damages for noncompliance. In connection with the acquisition and ownership of real properties, we may be exposed to such costs in connection with such regulations. The cost of defending against environmental claims, of any damages or fines we must pay, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements or of remediating any contaminated real property could materially and adversely affect our business, lower the value of our assets or results of operations and, consequently, lower the amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
We do not believe that compliance with existing environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.
