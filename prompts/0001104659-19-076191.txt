ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
General
 
Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“We,” “Our,” “us,” the “Company,” or “BASi”) is a contract research organization ("CRO") that provides drug discovery and development services to the pharmaceutical, chemical, and medical device industries, and sells analytical instruments to the pharmaceutical development and contract research industries. Our mission is to provide product developers with superior scientific research and innovative analytical instrumentation in order to bring revolutionary new products to market quickly and safely. Our strategy is to provide services that will generate high-quality and timely data in support of new product approval or expand their use. Our clients and partners include pharmaceutical, biotechnology, biomedical device, academic and government organizations. We provide innovative technologies and products and a commitment to quality to help clients and partners accelerate the development of safe and effective products and maximize the returns on their research and development investments. We offer an efficient, variable-cost alternative to our clients’ internal product development programs. Outsourcing development work to reduce overhead and speed product approvals through the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and other regulatory authorities is an established alternative to in-house product development efforts. We derive our revenues from sales of our research services and instruments, both of which are focused on evaluating product safety and efficacy. The Company has been involved in the research of products to treat diseases in numerous therapeutic areas for over 45 years since its formation as a corporation organized in Indiana in 1974.
 
We support both the non-clinical and clinical development needs of researchers and clinicians for primarily small molecule drug candidates, but also including biotherapeutics and devices. Our scientists have the skills in analytical instrumentation development, chemistry, computer software development, histology, pathology, physiology, medicine, surgery, analytical chemistry, drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology to make the services and products we provide increasingly valuable to our current and potential clients. Our principal clients are scientists engaged in analytical chemistry, drug safety evaluation, clinical trials, drug metabolism studies, pharmacokinetics and basic research from small start-up biotechnology companies to many of the largest global pharmaceutical companies. We are committed to bringing scientific expertise, quality and speed to every drug discovery and development program to help our clients develop safe and effective life-changing therapies.
 
Developments within the industries we serve have a direct, and sometimes material, impact on our operations. Currently, many large pharmaceutical companies have major "blockbuster" drugs that are nearing the end of their patent protections. This puts significant pressure on these companies both to develop new drugs with large market opportunity, and to re-evaluate their cost structures and the time-to-market of their products. Contract research organizations have benefited from these developments, as the pharmaceutical industry has turned to out-sourcing to both reduce fixed costs and to increase the speed of research and data development necessary for new product applications. The number of significant drugs that have reached or are nearing the end of their patent protection has also benefited the generic drug industry. Generic drug companies provide a significant source of new business for CROs as they develop, test and manufacture their generic compounds.

A significant portion of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry is now being driven by smaller, venture capital funded drug discovery companies. Many of these companies are "single-molecule" entities, whose success depends on one innovative compound. While several biotech companies have reached the status of major pharmaceutical companies, the industry is still characterized by smaller entities. These developmental companies generally do not have the resources to perform much of the research within their organizations, and are therefore dependent on the CRO industry for both their research and for guidance in preparing their regulatory submissions. These companies have provided significant new opportunities for the CRO industry, including BASI. We believe that the Company is ideally positioned to serve these clients as they look for alternatives to the large CROs that cater primarily to the large pharmaceutical company segment of the marketplace.
 
Industry Overview 
 
Drug discovery and development is the process of creating drugs for the treatment of human and animal disease. The drug discovery process aims to identify potential drug candidates, while the drug development process involves the testing of these drug candidates in animals and humans to meet requirements for regulatory approval. The process for researching and developing new medicines is growing in difficulty and length. On average, it takes at least ten years for a new medicine to complete the journey from initial discovery to the marketplace, with clinical trials alone taking six to seven years on average. The average cost to research and develop each successful drug is estimated to be $2.6 billion. This number incorporates the cost of failures – of the thousands and sometimes millions of compounds that may be screened and assessed early in the R&D process, only a few will ultimately receive approval. The overall probability of clinical success (the likelihood that a drug entering clinical testing will eventually be approved) is estimated to be less than 10%.
 
The drug development services industry provides independent product development services to pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and government organizations. This industry has evolved from providing limited clinical trial services in the 1970s to a full-service industry today characterized by broader relationships with clients and by service offerings that encompass the entire drug development process, including non-clinical efficacy and safety evaluations, study design, clinical trial management, data collection, biostatistical analyses, regulatory consulting, clinical laboratory and diagnostic services, pre- and post-approval safety analysis, product registration and post-approval support.
 
Over the past few decades, technological advances, as well as the emergence of the biotechnology industry, have dramatically changed the drug discovery process. New and improved technologies have evolved such as ultra-high-throughput screening, new in vitro and in vivo preclinical profiling techniques and the gene-based drug research commonly referred to as genomics. The objective of these innovations is to find more drug targets and to screen chemical compounds against targets much more quickly, with literally millions of compounds possible. This process is expected to produce many more molecules having the ability to affect biological activity. These molecules then need to be tested quickly and economically to determine their viability as potentially safe and effective drug candidates.
 
Trends Affecting the Drug Discovery and Development Industry
 
Our services and products are primarily marketed globally to pharmaceutical, medical research and biotechnology companies and institutions (academic and governmental) engaged in drug research and development. The research services industry is highly fragmented among many niche vendors as well as a small number of consolidating larger companies; the latter offer an ever-growing portfolio of start-to-finish pharmaceutical development services. Our services and products may have distinctly different clients (including separate divisions in a single large pharmaceutical company) and requirements. We believe that market trends in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries demonstrate an increasing emphasis towards outsourcing, as companies seek to maintain reduced internal resources in favor of variable cost models that offer high quality and higher accountability alternatives to meet their drug discovery, development and manufacturing needs. We believe that our clients are facing increased pressure to outsource facets of their research and development activities and that the following factors will increase client outsourcing.

Accelerated Drug Development
 
Clients continue to demand faster, more efficient, more selective development of an increasing pool of drug and device candidates. Consequently, our clients require fast, high-quality service in order to make well-informed decisions to quickly exclude poor candidates and speed development of successful ones. The need for additional development capacity to exploit more opportunities, accelerate development, extend market exclusivity and increase profitability drives the demand for outsourced services.
Increase in Potential New Drug Candidates
 
While research and development spending and the number of drug candidates are increasing, the time and cost required to develop a new drug or device candidate have also increased. Many small and virtual pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies do not have sufficient internal resources to pursue development of all of the new drug and device candidates on their own. Consequently, these companies are looking to the drug discovery and development services industry for cost-effective, innovative and rapid means of developing new drugs.
Cost Pressures of Introducing New Drugs
 
Market forces, healthcare reform and other governmental initiatives place significant pressures on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to reduce drug prices. In addition, increased competition as a result of patent expiration, market acceptance of generic drugs, and governmental and privately managed care organization efforts to reduce healthcare costs have added to drug pricing pressures. The pharmaceutical industry is responding by consolidating, streamlining operations, decentralizing internal discovery and development processes, and minimizing fixed costs. In addition, increased pressures to differentiate products and justify drug pricing are resulting in an increased focus on healthcare economics, safety monitoring and commercialization services. Moreover, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are attempting to increase the speed and efficiency of internal new drug discovery and development processes.
Patent Expiration
 
As exclusivity ends with patent expiry, drug companies defend their proprietary positions against generic competition with various patent extension strategies. Both the drug company pursuing these extensions and the generic competitors provide additional opportunities for the Company.
Alliances
 
Strategic alliances allow pharmaceutical companies to share research know-how and to develop and market new drugs faster in more diverse, global markets. We believe that such alliances will lead to a greater number of potential drugs in testing, many under study by small and virtual companies lacking broad technical resources. These small companies can add shareholder value by further developing new products through outsourcing, reducing risk for potential allies.  Clients seek realistic business partnerships with their service provider in an effort to ensure that costs are controlled and scientific continuity is maintained as their development programs progress. We have long-standing business relationships with many pharmaceutical companies and continue to offer flexible services and adapt to our clients’ requirements.
Mergers and Acquisitions
 
Consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry as well as its supporting contract research industry is commonplace. As pharmaceutical industry firms blend personnel, resources and business activities, we believe they will continue to streamline operations and minimize staffing, which will lead to more outsourcing and a dependence on small and virtual drug discovery efforts to feed their pipelines. Consolidation may result in a disruption in the progress of drug development programs as merging companies rationalize their respective drug development pipelines. In addition, recent consolidation within the contract research industry has created a unique opportunity for the emergence of mid-market providers who can offer clients a high degree of “touch” not only in study execution, but in program design and regulatory agency interactions.

Biotechnology Industry and Virtual Drug Company Growth
 
The U.S. biotechnology industry has grown rapidly over the last decade and has emerged as a key client segment for the drug discovery and development services industry. In recent years, this industry has generated significant numbers of new drug candidates that will require development and regulatory approval. Many biotechnology drug developers do not have in-house resources to conduct early stage drug development. Many new companies choose only to carry a product to a developed stage sufficient to attract a partner who will manufacture and market the drug. Because of the time and cost involved, these companies rely heavily on CROs to conduct research for their drug candidates.
Unique Technical Expertise
 
The increasing complexity of new drug candidates requires highly specialized, innovative, solution-driven research not available in all client labs. We believe that this need for unique technical expertise will increasingly lead to outsourcing of research activity. In addition, the reliance of the pharmaceutical industry on small innovative drug discovery companies which are often overlooked by large CROs creates an opportunity for strategic partnership with small, consulting-based and innovative CROs such as ours.
Data Management and Quality Expertise
 
Our clients and worldwide regulatory authorities require more data, greater access to that data, consistent and auditable management of that data, and greater security and control of that data. We have made significant investments in software throughout our contract services groups to optimize efficiency and promote compliance with regulations and market expectations.
 
Globalization of the Marketplace
 
Foreign firms rely on independent development companies like ours with experience in the U.S. to provide integrated services through all phases of product development and to assist in preparing complex regulatory submissions. Domestic drug firms are broadening product availability globally, demanding local regulatory approval. We believe that we and other domestic service providers with global reach, established regulatory expertise, and a broad range of integrated development services and products will benefit from this trend.
 
Our Solution 
 
We address the needs of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as academic, non-profit and government organizations, for drug discovery and development by providing integrated products and services to help our clients maximize the return on their research and development investments. Our application of innovative technologies and products and our commitment to quality throughout the drug discovery and development process offer our clients a way to identify and develop successful drugs and devices more quickly and cost-effectively. We have obtained significant drug development expertise from more than 40 years of operation.
The Company's Role in the Drug Development Process
 
In addition to providing research support prior to identification of new product candidates, after a new drug candidate is identified and carried through this preliminary screening, the development process for new drugs has three distinct phases.
 
1)            The nonclinical phase includes safety testing to prepare an Investigational New Drug ("IND") application for submission to the FDA. The IND must be accepted by the FDA before the drug candidate can be initially tested in humans. Once a pharmacologically active molecule is fully analyzed to confirm its potential utility, the initial dosage form for clinical trials is created. An analytical chemistry method is developed to enable reliable quantification. Stability and purity of the formulation are also determined. 
 
Clients work with our nonclinical services group to establish initial pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety characteristics of the drug candidate. These safety studies range from dose ranging studies, that involve acute safety evaluation of drug candidates and medical devices to chronic, multi-year oncogenicity and reproductive toxicity studies. Dose formulation analysis is provided by our pharmaceutical analysis group. Bioanalyses of blood sampled under these protocols by our bioanalytical services group provide pharmacokinetic and metabolism data that is used with the safety and toxicity information to determine the exposure required to demonstrate toxicity. A no observable adverse effect level is then established for the drug and sets the basis for future safety testing and clinical phase I studies. Upon successful completion of nonclinical safety studies, an IND submission is prepared and reviewed by FDA prior to initiation of human clinical trials.

Many of our products are designed for use in discovery and nonclinical development. The Culex® family of robotic automated dose delivery, blood and other biofluids sampling and physiological parameters measurement systems enable researchers to quickly and cost effectively determine PK/PD profiles of drugs in large and small animal models. The Culex® system allows experiments on freely moving conscious animals from early research for therapeutic target validation to lead optimization of compounds. Using the Culex® system, researchers are able to automatically dose and sample in-vivo to develop pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of drugs during early screening in rodents and other animals quickly and cost effectively. Our bioanalytical services group utilizes our depth of expertise in liquid chromatography with detection by mass spectrometry to support research, nonclinical and clinical programs. We also offer bioanalytical services that utilize electrochemistry, spectrophotometric (UV/Vis or fluorescence) and Corona Discharge detection as options. We have invested in robotics and mass spectrometry systems. Application of this technology allows us to rapidly develop and validate methods for new compounds and obtain information suitable for regulatory submission.
 
2)            The clinical phase further explores the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate in humans. The sponsor conducts Phase I human clinical trials in a limited number of healthy individuals to determine safety and tolerability. Bioanalytical assays determine the availability and metabolism of the active ingredient following administration. Expertise in method development and validation is critical, particularly for new chemical entities. During the clinical phase of development, additional non-clinical animal studies (including sub-chronic and chronic toxicology studies, carcinogenicity studies, reproductive toxicology studies, etc.) are performed to allow the drug to proceed through clinical development and to support product registration.
 
Exhaustive safety, tolerability and dosing regimens are established in patients in Phase II trials. Phase III clinical trials verify efficacy and safety. After successful completion of Phase III trials, the sponsor of the new drug submits a New Drug Application ("NDA") or Biologics License Application ("BLA") to the FDA requesting that the product be approved for marketing. Early manufacturing demonstrates production of the substance in accordance with FDA Good Manufacturing Practices ("GMP") guidelines. Data are compiled in an NDA, or for biotechnology products a BLA, for submission to the FDA requesting approval to market the drug or product. The bioanalytical sample count per study grows rapidly from Phase I through Phase III. Phase II and III studies may take several years to complete, supported by well-proven and consistently applied analytical methods.
 
Our services include evaluation of bioequivalence and bioavailability to monitor the rate and extent to which a drug is available in the body and to demonstrate that the availability is consistent between formulations. We also offer in-vitro bioequivalence testing for poorly-absorbed oral drugs. We offer support and testing services in clinical sample development, release and stability.
 
3)            The Post-approval phase follows FDA approval of the NDA or BLA. This includes production and continued analytical and clinical monitoring of the drug. The post-approval phase also includes development and regulatory approval of product modifications and line extensions, including improved dosage forms. The drug manufacturer must comply with quality assurance and quality control requirements throughout production and must continue analytical and stability studies of the drug during commercial production to continue to validate production processes and confirm product shelf life. Samples from each manufactured batch must be tested prior to release of the batch for distribution to the public. 
 
We also provide services during the post-approval phase, including bioequivalence studies of new formulations, line extensions, new disease indications and drug interaction studies. Our ability to offer GMP electrochemical detection services has provided increased business opportunities for release testing.
 
Increases in our services offerings have resulted in our ability to provide a broader range of services to our clients, often using combined services of several disciplines to address program needs. Our ability to solve problems by combining our knowledge base, services and products has been a factor in our selection by major pharmaceutical companies to assist in several preclinical through post-approval phases.

Contractual Arrangements
 
Our service contracts typically establish an estimated fee to be paid for identified services. In most cases, some percentage of the contract costs is paid in advance. While we are performing a contract, clients often adjust the scope of services to be provided based on interim project results. Fees are adjusted accordingly. Generally, our fee-for-service contracts are terminable by the client upon written notice of 30 days or less for a variety of reasons, including the client's decision to forego a particular study, the failure of product prototypes to satisfy safety requirements, and unexpected or undesired results of product testing. Cancellation or delay of ongoing contracts may result in fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results. We are generally able to recover, at minimum, our invested costs when contracts are terminated.
 
Our products business offers both annual and multi-year service and maintenance agreements on many of our product lines.

Government Regulation
 
We are subject to various regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of our data and products. These regulations are promulgated primarily under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and include Good Laboratory Practice ("GLP"), Good Manufacturing Practice ("GMP"), Bioequivalence regulations (“BE”) and Good Clinical Practice ("GCP") guidelines administered by the FDA. The standards of GLP, GMP, BE and GCP are required by the FDA and by similar regulatory authorities around the world. These requirements demand rigorous attention to employee training; detailed documentation; equipment validation; careful tracking of changes and routine auditing of compliance. Noncompliance with these standards could result in disqualification of project data collected by the Company. Material violations of GLP, GMP, BE or GCP regulations could result in regulatory sanctions and, in severe cases, could also result in a discontinuance of selected operations.  Since our formation, we have been inspected, on a routine basis, by the FDA. The FDA has inspected our West Lafayette location twenty-two times and our Evansville location six times, our St. Louis, MO location three times and our Gaithersburg, MD location three times. Of the thirty-four FDA inspections, twenty-two were without findings.  Where the FDA had findings, which have not been significant to our operations, we have taken actions to address the findings and the FDA has informed us that it deemed the actions taken as acceptable.
 
We are also subject to, and required to comply with, regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). The EPA has inspected the West Lafayette location twice. Both inspections ended without findings.
 
We have not experienced any significant problems to date in complying with the regulations of the FDA and EPA and do not believe that any existing or proposed regulations will require material capital expenditures or changes in our method of operation.
 
Analytical Services
 
Laboratories that provide information included in INDs, NDAs and BLAs must conform to regulatory requirements that are designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the testing process. Most of our contract research services are subject to government standards for laboratory practices that are embodied in regulations for GLP, GMP, BE and GCP. The FDA, EPA and other regulatory authorities require that test results submitted to such authorities be based on studies conducted in accordance with the regulations listed above. These requirements include but are not restricted to the following areas:

· | Resources – organization, personnel, facilities and equipment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | Rules – protocols and written procedures;
--+------------------------------------------


· | Characterization – test items and test systems;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | Documentation – raw data, final report and archives; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | Quality assurance unit – formalized internal audit function.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
We must also maintain reports for each study for specified periods for auditing by the study sponsor and by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities in other parts of the world. Noncompliance with these regulations can result in the disqualification of data collected during the preclinical trial.
 
Nonclinical Services
 
Our animal research facilities are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations, including The Animal Welfare Act and the rules and regulations enforced by the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") and the National Institutes of Health ("NIH"). These regulations establish the standards for the humane treatment, care and handling of animals by dealers and research facilities. Our animal research facilities maintain detailed standard operating procedures and other documentation necessary to comply with applicable regulations for the humane treatment of the animals in our custody. In addition to being licensed by the USDA as a research facility, we are also accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International and have registered assurance with the NIH.
 
11


Quality Assurance and Information Technology
 
To ensure compliance with applicable regulations, we have established quality assurance programs at our facilities, which include auditing of test data, personnel training, review of procedures and regular inspection of facilities. Regulatory guidelines serve as a basis for our Standard Operating Procedures (“SOPs”) where applicable. On an ongoing basis, we endeavor to standardize SOPs across all relevant operations. We have both developed and purchased software to ensure compliant documentation, handling and reporting of laboratory-generated study data.
 
We adhere to 21 CFR Part 11 (FDA regulations on electronic records and electronic signatures that define the criteria under which electronic records and electronic signatures are considered to be trustworthy, reliable and equivalent to paper records).  Our contract research operations were compliant with applicable U.S. FDA regulations (including 21 CFR Part 11) in our analytical, bioanalytical, toxicology, laboratory information management, and document management systems.  Systems compliant with 21 CFR Part 11 were formally validated and released for use in regulated studies.
 
We manage our business systems through the use of an Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system. We are continually refining and adjusting our ERP system to improve efficiency, provide better management tools and address changes in our business. These changes are appropriately documented and tested before implementation. We also test these systems in connection with management’s annual review of our internal control systems. Management’s assessment and report on disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting is included in Item 9A.
 
Controlled, Hazardous, and Environmentally Threatening Substances
 
Some of our development and testing activities are subject to the Controlled Substances Act administered by the Drug Enforcement Agency ("DEA"), which strictly regulates all narcotic and habit-forming substances. We maintain restricted-access facilities and heightened control procedures for projects involving such substances due to the level of security and other controls required by the DEA. In addition, we are subject to other federal and state regulations concerning such matters as occupational safety and health and protection of the environment.
 
Our laboratories are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee right-to-know regulations, the handling and disposal of medical specimens and hazardous waste, as well as the safety and health of laboratory employees. All of our laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to the storage and disposal of laboratory specimens, including regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, the National Fire Protection Agency and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions.
 
The regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service and the U.S. Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens. Our laboratories also comply with the International Air Transport Association regulations which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens. Furthermore, when materials are sent to a foreign country, the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws, rules and regulations of such foreign country.
 
Safety
 
In addition to comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to chemicals, and transmission of blood-borne and airborne pathogens. Relevant employees receive initial and periodic training focusing on compliance with applicable hazardous materials regulations and health and safety guidelines.

HIPAA
 
Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regulates the disclosure of confidential medical information in the United States. We have had a global privacy policy in place since January 2001 and believe that we are in compliance with HIPAA and current European Union requirements regarding confidential medical information. We continue to monitor our compliance with these regulations, and we intend to take appropriate steps to promote compliance as these and other privacy regulations are revised or additional regulations come into effect.
Product Liability and Insurance
 
We maintain product liability and professional errors and omissions liability insurance, providing coverage on a claims-made basis. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we seek to manage our liability risk through contractual provisions to be indemnified by the client or covered by the client’s liability insurance policies. Also, in certain types of engagements, we seek to limit our contractual liability to clients to the amount of fees received. Our client contractual arrangements are subject to negotiation, and the terms and scope of indemnification, liability limitation and insurance coverage vary by client and project.
Research and Development
 
In fiscal 2019 and 2018, we spent $627 and $596, respectively, on research and development. Separate from our contract research services business, we maintain applications research and development to enhance our products business. Expenditures cover hardware and software engineering costs, laboratory supplies, labor, prototype development and laboratory demonstrations of new products and applications for those products.
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our patents, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business. Accordingly, we actively seek protection for those rights both in the United States and abroad. Where we deem it to be an appropriate course of action, we will vigorously prosecute patent infringements. The loss of any one or more of our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other proprietary rights could be material to our consolidated revenues or earnings.
 
We currently hold four U.S. federally registered trademarks. We also have two issued U.S. patents on the Dried Blood Spot (DBS) sampling card for the Culex® Automated Blood Sampling Instrumentation. There are also pending international patent applications for this technology in Japan, Canada, and Europe. Additionally, we have three issued U.S. patents for the No Blood Waste technology for the Culex® instrument. There are thirteen issued international patents for this technology in Europe, Japan and Canada. There are two additional issued U.S. patents and fifteen issued international patents in Germany, Denmark, Europe, Spain, France, Great Britain, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland relating to the Raturn® technology which can be used with the Culex® system; two issued U.S. patents and one issued Canadian patent relating to pinch valve technology; and thirteen pending international patent applications in Canada, Japan and Europe relating to a tube assembly system that could potentially be used in the Culex® system.
 
Our issued patents are protected for durations ranging from October of 2019 to August of 2037. In addition to these formal intellectual property rights, we rely on trade secrets, unpatented know-how and continuing applications research which we seek to protect through means of reasonable business procedures, such as confidentiality agreements.
 
Raw Materials
 
There are no specialized raw materials that are particularly essential to our business. We have a variety of alternative suppliers for the components in our products.

Employees
 
At September 30, 2019, we had 311 full-time employees and 11 part-time employees. All employees enter into confidentiality agreements intended to protect our proprietary information. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified professional, scientific and technical staff. The level of competition among employers for skilled personnel is high. We believe that our employee benefit plans enhance employee morale, professional commitment and work productivity and provide an incentive for employees to remain with the Company.
