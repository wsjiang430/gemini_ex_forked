INSURANCE COMPANY OPERATION
 General
 The insurance company operation is conducted through Crusader. Crusader is a multiple line property and casualty insurance company that began transacting business on January 1, 1985. From 2004 until June 2014, all of Crusader’s business was written in the state of California. Crusader’s business remains concentrated in California (99.8%, 99.7%, and 99.5% of direct written premium (before reinsurance ceded) in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Crusader underwrites three statutory annual statement lines of business: (1) commercial multiple peril (“CMP”), (2) liability other than automobile and products, and (3) fire. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, CMP policies comprised 98%, 99%, and 98% of Crusader’s direct written premium, respectively. CMP policies include both property and liability coverages. Commercial property coverage insures against loss or damage to buildings, inventory and equipment from natural disasters, including hurricanes, windstorms, hail, water, explosions, severe winter weather, and other events such as theft and vandalism, fires, storms, and financial loss due to business interruption resulting from covered property damage. However, Crusader does not write earthquake coverage. Commercial liability coverage insures against third party liability from accidents occurring on the insured’s premises or arising out of its operation. In addition to CMP policies, Crusader also writes separate policies to insure commercial property and commercial liability risks on a mono-line basis which provides either commercial property or commercial liability coverage, but not both. Crusader is domiciled in California; and, as of December 31, 2018, Crusader is licensed as an admitted insurance carrier in the states of Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.

Production and Servicing of Policies
 Crusader sells its insurance policies through Unifax Insurance Systems, Inc. (“Unifax”), a subsidiary of the Company and Crusader’s sister corporation and exclusive general agent. All policies are produced by a network of independent brokers and agents.
 
The property casualty insurance marketplace continues to be intensely competitive. While Crusader attempts to meet such competition with competitive prices, its emphasis is on service, promotion, and distribution. Crusader believes that rate adequacy is more important than premium growth and that underwriting profit (net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs) is its primary goal. Nonetheless, Crusader believes that it can grow its sales and profitability by focusing upon four areas of its operations: (1) product development, (2) improved service to highly-specialized retail brokers, (3) appointment of highly-specialized independent retail agents, and (4) use of alternative marketing channels.
 
Adjusting of Claims
 Crusader manages all of its claims with a staff of in-house claim adjusters. This staff adjusts claims and oversees all outside claim services such as attorneys, independent or outside claim adjusters, investigators, and experts as necessary.
Reinsurance
 A reinsurance transaction occurs when an insurance company transfers (cedes) a portion of its exposure on policies written to a reinsurer that assumes that risk for a premium (ceded premium). Reinsurance does not legally discharge Crusader from primary liability under its policies. If the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations, Crusader must nonetheless pay its policy obligations. Crusader’s primary excess of loss reinsurance agreements, or treaties, during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 are as follows:

Loss Year | | Reinsurers | A.M. Best Rating | Retention
----------+------+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------
 | 2018 | | Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. Inc. & Hannover Ruck SE | A+ A+ | $ | 500,000
 | 2017 | | Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. Inc. & Hannover Ruck SE | A A+ | $ | 500,000
 | 2016 | | Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. Inc. & Hannover Ruck SE & TOA Reinsurance Company of America | A A+ A+ | $ | 500,000

 
Reinsurance treaties are generally structured in layers, with different negotiated economic terms and retention of participation, or liability, in each layer. In calendar year 2018, Crusader retained a participation in its excess of loss reinsurance treaties of 5% in its 1st layer (reinsured losses between $500,000 and $1,000,000), 0% in its 2nd layer (reinsured losses between $1,000,000 and $4,000,000), and 0% in its property and casualty clash treaty. In calendar years 2017 and 2016, Crusader retained a participation in its excess of loss reinsurance treaties of 5% in its 1st layer (reinsured losses between $500,000 and $1,000,000), 0% in its 2nd layer (reinsured losses between $1,000,000 and $3,000,000), and 0% in its property and casualty clash treaty.
 Crusader also has catastrophe reinsurance treaties from various highly rated California authorized and California unauthorized reinsurance companies. These reinsurance treaties help protect Crusader against losses in excess of certain retentions from catastrophic events that may occur on property risks which Crusader insures. In calendar years 2018, 2017, and 2016, Crusader retained a participation in its catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance treaties of 5% in its 1st layer (reinsured losses between $1,000,000 and $10,000,000) and 0% in its 2nd layer (reinsured losses between $10,000,000 and $46,000,000).

Crusader has no reinsurance recoverable balances in dispute.
 
Crusader evaluates each of its ceded reinsurance treaties at its inception to determine if there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting literature. As of December 31, 2018, all such ceded contracts are accounted for as risk transfer reinsurance.
 
The aggregate amount of ceded earned premium to the reinsurers was $6,478,500, $6,656,508, and $6,097,248 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
 
On most of the premium that Crusader cedes to the reinsurer, the reinsurer pays a commission to Crusader that includes a reimbursement of the cost of acquiring the portion of the premium that is ceded. Crusader does not currently assume any reinsurance. Crusader intends to continue obtaining reinsurance although the availability and cost may vary from time to time. The unpaid losses ceded to the reinsurer are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet.
 
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
 Crusader maintains reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to both reported and unreported losses. When a claim for loss is reported to Crusader, a reserve is established for the expected cost to settle the claim, including estimates of any related legal expense and other costs associated with resolving the claim. These reserves are called “case based” reserves. In addition, Crusader also sets up reserves at the end of each reporting period for losses that have occurred but have not yet been reported to Crusader. These incurred but not reported losses are referred to as “IBNR” reserves.
 
Crusader establishes reserves for reported losses based on historical experience, upon case-by-case evaluation of facts surrounding each known loss, and upon the related policy provisions. The amount of reserves for unreported losses is estimated by analysis of historical and statistical information. The ultimate liability of Crusader may be greater or less than estimated reserves. Reserves are monitored and adjusted when appropriate and are reflected in the statement of operations in the period of adjustment. Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimated to cover the future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred.
 
Crusader does not discount to a present value the portion of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves expected to be paid in future periods. Federal tax law, however, requires Crusader to discount loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for federal income tax purposes.
 
Net Written Premium to Statutory Surplus Ratio
 The following table shows, for the periods indicated, Crusader's statutory ratio of net written premium (after reinsurance ceded) to statutory surplus. Since each property and casualty insurance company has different capital needs, an "acceptable" ratio of net written premium to statutory surplus for one company may be inapplicable to another. While there is no statutory requirement applicable to Crusader that establishes a permissible net premium to surplus ratio, guidelines established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) provide that such ratio should generally be no greater than 3 to 1.
 
 | Year ended December 31
----------------------------+-----------------------
Statutory Accounting Basis: | 2018 | | 2017 | 2016
Net written premium | $ | 25,874,020 | | $ | 31,628,111 | $ | 32,624,522
Statutory surplus | $ | 50,148,258 | | $ | 50,446,888 | $ | 59,120,443
Ratio | | 0.5 to 1 | | | 0.6 to 1 | | 0.6 to 1 

 
Crusader’s results herein are reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These results differ from Crusader’s financial results reported in accordance with Statutory Accounting Principles (“SAP”) as prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities. Crusader is required to file financial statements with insurance regulatory authorities prepared on a SAP basis.
 

7


SAP differs in certain respects from GAAP. The more significant of these differences that apply to Crusader are:
 

· | Under GAAP, policy acquisition costs such as commissions, premium taxes and other costs incurred in connection with the successful acquisition of new and renewal business are capitalized and amortized on a pro rata basis over the period in which the related premium is earned, rather than expensed as incurred as required by SAP.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Certain assets included in balance sheets under GAAP are designated as “non-admitted assets” and are charged directly against statutory surplus under SAP. Non-admitted assets primarily include premium receivables that are outstanding over 90 days, federal deferred tax assets in excess of statutory limitations, furniture, equipment, leasehold improvements, and prepaid expenses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Under GAAP, amounts related to ceded reinsurance are shown on a gross basis as prepaid reinsurance premium and reinsurance recoverable, rather than netted against unearned premium reserves and loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, respectively, as required by SAP.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Under GAAP, fixed maturity securities that are classified as available-for-sale are reported at estimated fair values, rather than at amortized cost or the lower of amortized cost or market, depending on the specific type of security, as required by SAP.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The differing treatment of income and expense items results in a corresponding difference in federal income tax expense. Under GAAP reporting, changes in deferred income taxes are reflected as an item of income tax benefit or expense. As required by SAP, federal income taxes are recorded as income tax benefit or expense when payable and deferred taxes, subject to limitations, are recognized but only to the extent that they do not exceed a specified percentage of statutory surplus. Changes in deferred taxes are recorded directly to statutory surplus.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulation
 The insurance company operation is subject to regulation by the California Department of Insurance (“CA DOI”) and by the insurance departments of other states in which Crusader is licensed. The insurance departments have broad regulatory, supervisory, and administrative powers. These powers relate primarily to the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature and limitation of insurers' investments; the prior approval of rates, rules, and forms; the issuance of securities by insurers; periodic financial and market conduct examinations of the affairs of insurers; the annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition and results of operations of such insurers or for other purposes; and the establishment of reserves required to be maintained for unearned premium, losses, and other purposes. The regulations and supervision by the insurance departments are designed principally for the benefit of policyholders and not for the insurance company shareholders. The insurance departments may perform market conduct examinations of Crusader to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations with respect to rating, underwriting and claims handling practices. The most recent market conduct examination of Crusader was conducted by the CA DOI and covered the rating and underwriting practices in California during the period June 1, 2015, through August 31, 2015.  The examination report was adopted by the CA DOI on January 9, 2017.  All issues identified during the examination were resolved to the satisfaction of the CA DOI and Crusader.  None of the issues identified during the examination had any material effect on Crusader.  The CA DOI conducts periodic financial examinations of Crusader. During 2017, the CA DOI completed a financial examination of Crusader’s December 31, 2015, statutory financial statements. On June 23, 2017, a report of examination was officially filed and became part of the records of the CA DOI. The Company has complied with all comments and recommendations identified in the report of examination, and none of the issues in that report of examination had any material effect on Crusader.
 
The NAIC uses a Risk-Based Capital (“RBC”) Model Law for property and casualty companies. The RBC Model Law is intended to provide standards for calculating a variable regulatory capital requirement related to a company's current operations and its risk exposures (asset risk, underwriting risk, credit risk and off-balance sheet risk). These standards are intended to serve as a diagnostic solvency tool for regulators that establish uniform capital levels and specific authority levels for regulatory intervention when an insurer falls below minimum capital levels. The RBC Model Law specifies four distinct action levels at which a regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over a domestic insurer if its RBC is equal to or less than 200% of its computed authorized control level RBC. A company's RBC is required to be disclosed in its statutory annual statement. The RBC is not intended to be used as a rating or ranking tool nor is it to be used in premium rate making or approval. Crusader’s adjusted capital at December 31, 2018, was 683% of the authorized control level RBC.

The following table sets forth the different levels of risk-based capital that may trigger regulatory involvement and the corresponding actions that may result.
 
LEVEL | TRIGGER | CORRECTIVE ACTION 
-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Company action level | Adjusted capital less than 200% of authorized control level | The insurer must submit a comprehensive plan to the insurance commissioner. 
Regulatory action level | Adjusted capital less than 150% of authorized control level | In addition to above, insurer is subject to examination, analysis and specific corrective action. 
Authorized control level | Adjusted capital less than 100% of authorized control level | In addition to both of the above, insurance commissioner may place insurer under regulatory control.
Mandatory control level | Adjusted capital less than 70% of authorized control level | Insurer must be placed under regulatory control. 

 
Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”) was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators primarily to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies. IRIS helps those companies that merit highest priority in the allocation of the regulators’ resources on the basis of 13 financial ratios that are calculated annually. The analytical phase is a review of statutory annual statements and the financial ratios. The ratios and trends are valuable in pointing to companies likely to experience financial difficulties but are not themselves indicative of adverse financial condition. The ratio and benchmark comparisons are mechanically produced and are not intended to replace the state insurance departments’ own in-depth financial analysis or on-site examinations.
 
An unusual range of ratio results has been established from studies of the ratios of companies that have become insolvent or have experienced financial difficulties. In the analytical phase, companies that receive four or more financial ratio values outside the usual range are analyzed in order to identify those companies that appear to require immediate regulatory action. Subsequently, a more comprehensive review of the ratio results and an insurer’s statutory annual statement is performed to confirm that an insurer’s situation calls for increased or close regulatory attention.
 
In 2018, Crusader was outside the usual value range on the following one of the 13 IRIS ratio tests:


IRIS Ratio | Unusual Value | | Crusader’s Result
-------------------------------------+---------------+-----------+------------------
5 – two-year overall operating ratio | | Over 100% | | 113.0 | %

 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, Crusader was outside the usual value range on IRIS ratio 5 due primarily to Crusader’s net loss of $453,966. Crusader’s net loss during the year ended December 31, 2018, was due primarily to adverse development of insured events of prior years.


In 2017, Crusader was outside the usual value range on the following four of the 13 IRIS ratio tests:


IRIS Ratio | Unusual Value | | Crusader’s Result
----------------------------------------------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------+------------------
5 – two-year overall operating ratio | | Over 100% | | 110.0 | %
6 – investment yield | | Equal or greater than 6.5% or equal or less than 3.0% | | 1.5 | %
7 – gross change in policyholders’ surplus | | Equal or greater than 50% or equal or less than -10% | | -15 | %
8 – change in adjusted policyholders’ surplus | | Equal or greater than 25% or equal or less than -10% | | -15 | %

 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, Crusader was outside the usual value range on IRIS ratios 5, 7, and 8 due primarily to Crusader’s $6,207,351 net loss. Crusader was outside the usual value range on IRIS ratio 6 due primarily to Crusader’s relatively conservative investments.
 
In 2016, Crusader was outside the usual value range on the following one of the 13 IRIS ratio tests:


IRIS Ratio | Unusual Value | | Crusader’s Result
---------------------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------+------------------
6 – investment yield | | Equal or greater than 6.5% or equal or less than 3.0% | | 1.1 | %

 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, Crusader was outside the usual value range on IRIS ratio 6 due primarily to Crusader’s relatively conservative investments.

California Insurance Guarantee Association
 The California Insurance Guarantee Association (“CIGA”) was created to provide for payment of claims for which insolvent insurers of most casualty lines are liable but which such insurers’ assets as insufficient to satisfy. The Company is subject to assessment by CIGA for its pro-rata share of such claims based on written premium in the particular line in the year preceding the assessment by insurers writing that line of insurance in California. Such assessments are based upon estimates of losses to be incurred in liquidating an insolvent insurer. Assessments are recouped through a mandated surcharge to policyholders the year after the assessment. No assessment was made by CIGA for the 2018, 2017, and 2016 calendar years.
Holding Company Act
 Crusader is subject to regulation by the CA DOI pursuant to the provisions of the California Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (the "Holding Company Act"). Pursuant to the Holding Company Act, the CA DOI may examine the affairs of Crusader at any time. Certain transactions defined to be of an extraordinary type may not be effected without the prior approval of the CA DOI. Such transactions include, but are not limited to, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans and extensions of credit, and investments made within the immediately preceding 12 months involving the lesser of 3% of admitted assets or 25% of statutory surplus as of the preceding December 31. An extraordinary transaction also includes a dividend which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurance company's statutory surplus as of the preceding December 31 or the insurance company's net income for the preceding calendar year. An insurance company is also required to notify the CA DOI of any dividend after declaration, but prior to payment.
 
The Holding Company Act also provides that the acquisition or change of control of a California domiciled insurance company or of any person who controls such an insurance company cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the insurance commissioner. In general, a presumption of control arises from the ownership of voting securities and securities that are convertible into voting securities, which in the aggregate constitute 10% or more of the voting securities of a California insurance company or a person who controls a California insurance company, such as Crusader. A person seeking to acquire control, directly or indirectly, of the Company must generally file with the insurance commissioner an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy of the application to the Company. The Holding Company Act also effectively restricts the Company from consummating certain reorganizations or mergers without prior regulatory approval. The Company is in compliance with the Holding Company Act.
 
Rating
 Insurance companies are rated to provide both industry participants and insurance consumers with meaningful information on specific insurance companies. Higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a strong ability to pay claims. These ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors. Such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy, hold or sell any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Ratings focus primarily on the following factors: capital resources, financial strength, demonstrated management expertise in the insurance business, credit analysis, systems development, market segment position and growth opportunities, marketing, sales conduct practices, investment operations, minimum statutory surplus requirements and capital sufficiency to meet projected growth, as well as access to such traditional capital as may be necessary to continue to meet standards for capital adequacy.
 
The claims-paying abilities of insurers are rated to provide both insurance consumers and industry participants with comparative information on specific insurance companies. Claims-paying ratings are important for the marketing of certain insurance products.
 
On January 17, 2019, A.M. Best Company downgraded Crusader’s Financial Strength Rating to B++ (Good) from A- (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating to bbb+ from a-. The outlook of the Financial Strength Rating has been revised to stable from negative while the outlook of the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating remains negative.  The rating downgrades reflect a revision in A.M. Best’s assessment of Crusader’s operating performance to adequate from strong.

Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002
 On November 26, 2002, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act was extended in 2005, reauthorized in 2007 and 2017, and is set to expire on December 31, 2020. The Act establishes a program within the Department of the Treasury in which the federal government will share the risk of loss from acts of terrorism with the insurance industry. Federal participation will be triggered when the Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General of the United States, certifies an act to be an act of terrorism. No act shall be certified as an act of terrorism unless the terrorist act results in aggregate losses in excess of $5 million.
 
Under the reauthorized Act, the federal government will pay the following percentages of covered terrorism losses exceeding the statutorily established deductible for the reported years and remaining years under the Act:
 

Loss Year | Coverage Percentage | 
----------+---------------------+--
2016 | 84 | %
2017 | 83 | %
2018 | 82 | %
2019 | 81 | %
2020 | 80 | %

 
All property and casualty insurance companies are required to participate in the program to the extent that they must make available property and casualty insurance coverage for terrorism that does not differ materially from the terms, amounts and other coverage limitations applicable to losses arising from events other than acts of terrorism.
 
The Company does not write policies on properties considered targets of terrorist activities such as airports, large hotels, large office structures, amusement parks, landmark defined structures, or other large scale public facilities. In addition, there is not a high concentration of policies in any one area where increased exposure to terrorist threats exist. Consequently, the Company believes its exposure relating to acts of terrorism is low. Crusader received $94,014, $111,773, and $105,302 in terrorism coverage premium from approximately 6%, 5%, and 5% of its policyholders during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Crusader’s terrorism deductible was $7,799,966, $7,490,724, and $6,980,486 during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Crusader’s 2019 terrorism deductible is $7,046,682.

 The property and casualty markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive. Property and casualty insurers generally compete on many factors, including price, commission rates, consumer recognition, coverages offered, financial stability, customer service and geographic coverage. Competition is also affected by the pace of technological developments. An insurer’s ability to innovate, develop and implement new applications and other technology can affect its competitive position. The Company continues to invest in technology in order to compete more effectively in the insurance marketplace. The marketplace is highly cyclical, characterized by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess underwriting capacity.
 
The profitability of insurers is affected by many factors including premium adequacy, the frequency and severity of claims, state regulations, interest rates, general business conditions, and court decisions redefining and expanding the extent of coverage. One of the challenging and unique features of the property and casualty insurance business is the fact that since premiums are collected before losses are paid, its products are normally priced before its costs are known.

Insurance Premium Financing Operation
 AAC’s insurance premium financing operation currently finances policies produced only through its sister company, Unifax. Consequently, AAC’s growth is primarily dependent on the growth of Crusader and Unifax business. From July 2010 to March 1, 2018, AAC offered 0% financing on policies produced by Unifax for Crusader. Effective March 1, 2018, the annual percentage rate charged by AAC on new loans increased to 4.99% from 0%. The Company believes the new interest rate is competitive and will not have a negative impact on its business.
Health Insurance Operation
 The health insurance market is uncertain due to changes in healthcare insurance mandated by recent federal legislation.
