ITEM 1. BUSINESS
In this Annual Report, when we use the terms the “Company,” “Skillz,” “we,” “us” and “our,” unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, we are referring to Skillz Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Overview
We were founded on one simple belief: everyone loves to compete. We are building the competition layer of the internet by re-inventing competitive mobile gaming. 
We want to bring out the best in everyone through competition. We believe in the potential for all people to unleash their inner champions through competition and for developers to bring their art to the world and achieve their dreams of financial success.
Our proprietary platform revolutionizes and democratizes the mobile gaming industry by “leveling the playing field” for developers worldwide, enabling us to deliver gaming experiences that our player community trusts and loves.
The trust and fairness we foster with our player community is part of the foundation upon which our business is built.
Our Platform
Overview
 We are re-inventing competitive mobile gaming and thereby expanding the mobile gaming market. Our technology platform aligns the interests of developers and gamers with respect to user monetization, rather than putting them at odds. Traditional mobile games utilize in-game advertisements or purchases, which we believe creates friction in the user experience, hurting engagement and retention. By monetizing user engagement primarily through prizes, we create a compelling alternative for both developers and users of competitive games. With our system, the more users enjoy playing in contests for prizes and the longer they play, the more revenue we generate for developers. We believe this dynamic generates significantly stronger monetization for developers compared to traditional mobile game monetization.
Gamer Competition Engine
Our end-to-end technology platform enables mobile game developers to improve gameplay experiences and drive improved engagement, retention and revenue from their content. Our easy-to-integrate software development kit, or “SDK,” contains over 200 features in a smaller than 16-megabyte package, which allows for seamless over-the-air updates.
Rating and matching users is a challenging technical problem, as the fastest match is the next user in line to play, while the fairest match (i.e., a theoretically perfectly matched skill rating) could take a much longer time to find. User retention is sensitive to both fair matching and time to match and, therefore, we have invested significantly in technology to optimize these competing objectives.
Our SDK includes many social features such as in-game chat, friends, tournaments and leagues which allow players to interact and build relationships, strengthening the Skillz player community. Our players enjoy social experiences around our games, by communicating during and after competitions, on topics ranging from sharing gameplay strategies to building healthy rivalries and making personal connections. Our Friends feature allows players to challenge a friend to a match and broadcasts that player’s affinity for Skillz to their social network.
Developer Console
Our intuitive developer dashboard enables our developer partners to rapidly integrate and monitor the performance of their games on our platform. The first step for a game developer integrating our tournament management system is to sign up for a free account on our developer portal. Developer onboarding has been optimized to enable developers to quickly and easily set up an account, access technical documentation, download the SDK and access customer support. Our developer portal has been built such that an average game developer can implement our SDK in about a day, with little or no technical support. Once a game goes live on our platform, the developer portal provides game developers with a single system through which they can access analytics on user behavior and monetization for their games.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Live Operations
Delivering live operations in games is critical to user retention and engagement. Our live operations, or LiveOps, system manages and optimizes the user experience across the thousands of games on our platform. We have built a highly automated system to power LiveOps for the games on our platform. LiveOps in mobile games on our platform encompasses everything from generating new events to creating new and exciting tournament formats in which users can compete in brand and influencer-sponsored events. With our highly automated system, we are able to run LiveOps for the games on our platform with what we believe is a fraction of the resourcing required by a typical game developer.
We run multivariate testing on our system settings in order to optimize user engagement and retention for games on our platform. Our system manages the presentation of tournament formats, frequency of events and merchandising of the Ticketz store, which is our in-game store that allows users to redeem prizes in exchange for tickets earned in gameplay on our platform (“Ticketz”). Ticketz can be redeemed within our loyalty program for prizes or credits to be used towards future paid-entry tournaments. 
With our segment manager tool, we can administer important system settings for users on the platform, including the types of tournaments a user sees and is eligible to enter, deposit offers and promotions available to a user, and incentives and achievements presented to a user at various moments along their gaming journey.
Payment Infrastructure
We have developed a robust payments infrastructure and have achieved a system uptime of greater than 99.99%. We believe our technology capabilities are critical to building and maintaining trusted relationships with our developers and users.
Data Science
Our algorithms and machine learning technologies augment all facets of our platform. Key features of our proprietary data science technologies include anti-cheat, anti-fraud, player rating and matching, and segmentation engine. We believe our technology capabilities are industry-leading and have helped to differentiate our product offerings and fuel our growth.
Strong anti-cheat and anti-fraud protections are among the most critical elements required to foster a healthy competitive ecosystem. Our systems need to continuously evolve to stay ahead of sophisticated attempts to defraud or stack the odds against users. As a component of our proprietary security systems, we use our robust data to analyze and build statistical maps to predict users’ probable next outcome. This probability modeling then enables us to statistically detect anomalies, which are escalated for further review and remediation, where needed.
High personalization is an integral element to enhancing the gamer experience on our platform. For example, we invented a technology for creating user segments based on dynamically linking behaviors. Our technology allows us to overlap, concatenate and exclude different behaviors to create new user journeys through game environments. We have identified 65 different behavior sets, which enables us to increase the number of potential unique user journeys exponentially and dynamically adjust for a significantly more personalized experience.
We give gamers confidence to transact on our platform by delivering on our values of trust and fairness. We enable game developers to focus on what they do best: build great content. We provide developers of all sizes with a comprehensive technology platform enabling them to compete with the largest and most sophisticated mobile game developers in the world.
Our Developer Community
We have a growing community of developers using our platform to bring their art to the world. Content creation has been democratized in recent years with the introduction of standardized game development and distribution platforms and, as of December 31, 2022, we had over 16,000 registered game developers launch game integration on our system. As of December 31, 2022 over 500 developers had a game on our platform with at least one installed user. Our self-serve platform enables our developer customers to integrate and monitor their game performance through sophisticated dashboards. This allows the developers to do what they do best — build great games — while we help them on all other fronts by delivering services such as payments, analytics, LiveOps, prize fulfillment and customer service. Historically, a small number of games have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Games on our platform initially go live with free-to-play capabilities, before applying for prized competitions. We carefully curate which games are enabled for prizes based on a number of criteria, to ensure we provide an enticing competitive mobile gaming experience. We actively monitor metrics such as player liquidity inside each game (based on number of daily active users), the stability of each game (based on crash rates), user satisfaction (based on app store ratings), and user issues (as reported on support tickets). Games that do not meet our quality thresholds or are not determined by our proprietary algorithm to be skill-based are not prize enabled. We maintain player data and handle all communications with the players on behalf of our developers. This data model allows us to deliver effective monetization for the benefit of developers on our platform.
Our Gamer Community
We built a virtual world in which our gamer community shares in the thrill of victory or the agony of defeat, enjoying healthy rivalry, great achievements and valued recognition. Our social features such as chat, friend tournaments and leagues allow players to interact and build relationships, strengthening our player community. This community helps generate organic user growth, supplementing our paid user acquisition strategies. 
As illustrated in the table below, we believe our end-user demographic is the mass market and resembles the population at large.
Gaming for Good
We believe we have pioneered the next iteration of the charity walk-a-thon. Through our initiative, Gaming for Good, or G4G, our platform enables mass-participatory video game tournaments that harness the power of community through competition. Through our platform, non-profits can reach a dramatically broadened universe of younger, first-time donors. A diverse range of charitable initiatives have benefited from the power of our platform and gamer community. We have been honored to be trusted by some of the world’s leading non-profits, such as the World Wildlife Fund, the American Red Cross, the NAACP, and the American Cancer Society, to engage their audiences and expand their reach.
Games on Our Platform
We offer a wide range of gaming experiences for users. We enable game genres that can be played: (i) asynchronously; (ii) synchronously; or (iii) turn-based synchronously. An example of an asynchronous game would be a match-3 puzzle game or bingo game where users play the exact same game at different times and then the scores are compared when both contestants have played to determine the winner. An example of a turn-based synchronous game would be a dominoes game in which users take turns in real-time and the winner is determined when the game ends. An example of a synchronous game would be a real-time strategy game where users are making multiple moves simultaneously and then the winner is determined when the game ends.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Our Distribution
Our developers distribute their games through direct app downloads from our websites, as well as third-party platforms, such as the Apple App Store, which traditionally has been the main distribution channel for our developers’ games. In accordance with the Apple App Store policy, Apple does not take any share of the end-user deposits on our system; however, Apple does receive a fee for end-user deposits made through Apple Pay.
Our Marketing
Our ability to cost-effectively acquire new users is important to our success. We leverage software tools, analytics and data science to efficiently acquire, engage and retain users while reinforcing our trusted consumer-facing brand with both end users and our developer partners. We acquire and engage users primarily through digital ad networks, our game developers and affiliate partners. We use paid marketing channels, in combination with compelling offers and exciting games, to achieve our objectives. We optimize our marketing investment across channels in order to generate targeted returns on our marketing spending.
In addition to traditional paid advertising channels, we cross-promote our product offerings to our existing user base across our gaming ecosystem using a combination of content, contests and special offers.
We have significant opportunities to extend our marketing channels to offline media and deploy omni-channel marketing strategies to further expand our business. For example, partnerships with celebrities and influencers have the potential to cost-effectively reach new users. Moreover, we intend to opportunistically engage in brand marketing to drive broader consumer and developer awareness of our platform.
With existing users, we seek to improve engagement and retention through engagement marketing programs that provide rewards and awards for players active on our platform. Players earn loyalty currency, called Ticketz, every time they play a paid entry contest. The frequency and amount of entry fees determine the amount of Ticketz that are earned. Players can earn trophies as awards for performing certain actions or achieving milestones in games, for which they receive Ticketz or credits, to be used towards future paid-entry tournaments. Tickets earned through the loyalty rewards and awards programs can be redeemed in our in-app Ticketz Store for various prizes ranging from Skillz-branded apparel to luxury goods and vehicles.

Our Customer Advocacy
We provide 24/7 support and trust and safety services to our developers’ end-users. The customer support team responds to all user inquiries including support for game crashes, payment issues, and loyalty program inquiries. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our customer support team achieved a 92% Player CSAT and 44 Player NPS rating for cash players. Our Trust & Safety team reviews any suspicious payments and chargebacks, and investigates anomalous scoring patterns and user reports of cheating, among other things. These suspected bad actors are reviewed on a case-by-case basis with several escalating levels of review, which ultimately may require an in-person play test on a Skillz-provided mobile device administered by a third-party security vendor to confirm the user’s ability.
Our People
We were founded in 2012 by Andrew Paradise and Casey Chafkin. At Skillz, we believe that every employee contributes to shaping the future of interactive entertainment. We are a multinational technology company with over 240 employees located in 7 countries as of December 31, 2022, inclusive of employees of Aarki, which we acquired during 2021. Our business success is driven in large part by our highly skilled workforce. Additionally, we rely on independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce from time to time. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or are a party to any collective bargaining agreement with respect to their employment by us.
Culture and Engagement. Skillz was founded on strong ethical principles, and we have intentionally grown and continue to grow values-first – scaling our workforce, services, customer portfolio, and investment partners purposefully. To ensure our culture remains positive and strong, we conduct periodic engagement surveys to gain a better understanding of what is important to our employees. We believe that as a result of our values, we have been able to identify, attract, engage and retain great people. Our seven core values define who we are, who we would like to be, and how we make decisions:
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. At Skillz, we believe a diverse and inclusive workplace leads to greater innovation, agility, performance and engagement, enabling both business growth and societal impact. We envision a world where everyone plays games and we need everyone represented as we build that world, which is why we are dedicated to building a diverse team and inclusive environment as we scale. At Skillz, we ensure employees from diverse backgrounds are engaged, can be their authentic selves, build skills and achieve their greatest potential. Further, Skillz is committed to pay equity and representation from the bottom to the top: we were the first gaming company and the first eSports company to take the ParityPledge.
Competitive Compensation and Benefits. Skillz offers industry competitive wages and benefits. We also offer our employees a holistic total rewards package, with premier health and welfare programs for employees and family members. We believe our employees should have the support they need to maintain a strong work/life balance, grow personally and professionally, and save for their future. While the philosophy around our benefits is the same worldwide, specific benefits vary regionally due to local regulations and preferences. In addition, nearly every employee at Skillz is eligible for equity awards to share in the Company’s financial success.
Training and Development. At Skillz, we foster a strong culture of learning, innovation and growth. In 2021, we were named by Fast Company one of the Best Workplaces for Innovators. We believe that investing in the growth and development of Skillzians will directly enhance our overall company performance. In support of this, we offer mentorship programs and employee trainings designed to help Skillzians develop and manage their careers, drive accountability, and promote a culture of

continuous feedback. We also provide robust manager training that shares effective tools and frameworks around recruiting, managing, and developing our team members.
Our Competition
We primarily compete with alternative monetization services for mobile game content. This includes platforms that facilitate in-app advertisements and purchases. We principally compete on a number of factors, including a robust technology toolset designed with the ability to convert, engage and retain users. Our developers compete for end users with other forms of consumer discretionary entertainment that vie for the users’ time and disposable income. This includes companies that provide video entertainment, music entertainment, social networking and other forms of leisure entertainment. The large companies in our ecosystem may play multiple roles, given the breadth of their businesses. Examples of these larger companies include Sony, Amazon, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, and Unity. Most of these companies are also our partners.
Our Intellectual Property
Our business relies substantially on the creation, use and protection of intellectual property. We protect our intellectual property by relying on international, federal, state and common law rights. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors. We actively seek patent protection covering our inventions and as of December 31, 2022, we had over 110 patents granted or pending worldwide.
Government Regulation and Compliance
Regulation
We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that affect our business, including state and federal laws regarding skill-based gaming, consumer protection, electronic marketing, data protection and privacy, competition, taxation, intellectual property, export and national security, which are continuously evolving. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly outside of the U.S. It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves, particularly if we expand to other countries, we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions or other jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws and regulations.
State and federal laws in the U.S. and many other jurisdictions distinguish between games of skill and games of chance. We only enable games for paid entry-fee contests in jurisdictions in which skill-based gaming is permitted and not required to be licensed as gambling under applicable law. As of December 31, 2022, we enabled cash prizes in 45 states and the District of Columbia, covering approximately 90% of the U.S. population. Skillz enables cash prizes in all states except for Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Louisiana and South Dakota. We use proprietary algorithms and data science tools designed to ensure that the degree of skill involved in affecting the outcome of a contest is sufficient to comply with applicable state laws. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the determination as to whether a contest is skill-based, and therefore beyond the scope of a state’s gambling laws and licensing requirements, are subject to interpretation and evolving. We have not received any licenses, authorizations or approvals confirming that the paid entry-fee contests hosted on our platform comply with applicable laws. Our compliance is based on our interpretation of existing state and federal laws regarding skill-based gaming. There is a risk that existing or future laws in the states in which we operate may be interpreted in a manner that is not consistent with our current practices, and could have an adverse impact on our business and prospects. Additionally, existing and future laws that permit skill-based gaming may be accompanied in the future by restrictions or taxes that make it less feasible or impractical to operate in these jurisdictions.
It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us that could restrict the online and mobile industries, including with respect to player privacy, taxation, content suitability, copyright, distribution and antitrust. Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices. We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase and we will be required to devote legal and other resources to addressing such prospective regulation. For example, existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing of in-app purchases, or regulation of currency, banking institutions, unclaimed property or money transmission, may be interpreted to cover the games featured on our platform and the entry fees paid in respect of such contests. If that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements, and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the U.S. or elsewhere regarding these activities may impede the growth of social game services and impair our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Compliance
Because we handle, collect, store, receive, transmit and otherwise process certain personal information of users and employees, we are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws related to the privacy and protection of such data, including the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). The scope of data privacy laws and regulations worldwide continues to evolve, and we anticipate that the number of data privacy laws and the scope of individual data privacy and protection rights will increase.
We have developed internal compliance programs in an effort to comply with legal and regulatory requirements for skill-based gaming and with respect to data privacy and security. We use geofencing technology designed to restrict user access to paid entry fee contests to only those jurisdictions where video game contests of skill are permitted. While we are firmly committed to full compliance with all applicable laws and have developed appropriate policies and procedures in order to comply with the requirements of the evolving regulatory regimes, we cannot ensure that our compliance program will prevent the violation of one or more laws or regulations, or that a violation by us or an employee will not result in the imposition of a monetary fine.
