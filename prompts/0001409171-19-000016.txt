ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Our Company
Titan Machinery Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Titan Machinery," the "Company," "we," or "our") own and operate a network of full service agricultural and construction equipment stores in the United States and Europe. We have been an authorized dealer of CNH Industrial N.V. or its U.S. subsidiaries (collectively referred to in this Form 10-K as "CNH Industrial") since our inception in 1980. CNH Industrial is a leading manufacturer and supplier of agricultural and construction equipment, which includes the Case IH Agriculture, New Holland Agriculture, Case Construction and New Holland Construction brands. Based upon information provided to us by CNH Industrial, we are the largest retail dealer of Case IH Agriculture equipment in the world, the largest retail dealer of Case Construction equipment in North America and a major retail dealer of New Holland Agriculture and New Holland Construction equipment in the U.S. In addition to the CNH Industrial brands, we sell and service equipment made by a variety of other manufacturers.
We operate our business in three reportable segments, Agriculture, Construction and International, within which we engage in four principal business activities:

• | new and used equipment sales;


• | parts sales;


• | equipment repair and maintenance services; and


• | equipment rental and other activities.

We offer our customers a one-stop solution by providing equipment and parts sales, equipment repair and maintenance services, and rental functions in each store. Our full service approach provides us with multiple points of customer contact and cross-selling opportunities. We believe our mix of equipment sales and recurring parts and service sales, as well as our diverse geographic footprint, enables us to operate effectively throughout economic cycles. We also believe our scale, customer service, diverse and stable customer base, and experienced management team provide us with a competitive advantage in many of our local markets.
Throughout our 38-year operating history, we have built an extensive, geographically contiguous network of 74 stores in the U.S. and 30 stores in Europe. Our Agriculture stores in the U.S. are located in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota and include several highly productive farming regions, such as the Red River Valley in eastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota, portions of the corn belt in Iowa, eastern South Dakota and southern Minnesota, and along the I-80 corridor in Nebraska, which sits on top of the Ogallala Aquifer. Our Construction stores are located in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Our International stores are located in the European countries of Bulgaria, Germany, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine.
We have a history of growth through acquisitions. Since January 1, 2003, we have completed the acquisition of over 50 dealerships located in 11 states and four European countries. We believe that there will continue to be opportunities for dealership consolidation in the future, and we expect that acquisitions will continue to be a component of our long-term growth strategy.
Products and Services
Within each of our segments, we have four principal sources of revenue: new and used equipment sales, parts sales, equipment repair and maintenance services, and equipment rental and other business activities. 
New and Used Equipment Sales
We sell new agricultural and construction equipment manufactured under the CNH Industrial family of brands as well as equipment from a variety of other manufacturers. The used equipment we sell is primarily acquired through trade-ins from our customers. The agricultural equipment we sell and service includes machinery and attachments for uses ranging from large-scale farming to home and garden purposes. The construction equipment we sell and service includes heavy construction machinery, light industrial machinery for commercial and residential construction, road and highway construction machinery, and mining operations equipment. Equipment sales generate cross-selling opportunities by populating our markets with equipment we can repair and maintain and for which we sell parts. Equipment revenue represented 72.1%, 70.8% and 69.7% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Parts Sales
We sell a broad range of maintenance and replacement parts for brands of equipment that we carry, other makes of equipment, and other types of equipment and related components. We maintain an extensive in-house parts inventory to provide timely parts and repair and maintenance support to our customers. Our parts sales provide a relatively stable revenue stream that is less sensitive to economic cycles than our equipment sales. Parts revenue represented 16.7%, 17.0% and 17.8% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Equipment Repair and Maintenance Services
We provide repair and maintenance services, including warranty repairs, for our customers' equipment. All of our stores have service bays staffed by trained service technicians. In addition, our technicians are able to make off-site repairs at customer locations. We provide proactive and comprehensive customer service by maintaining service histories for each piece of equipment owned by our customers, maintaining 24/7 service hours in times of peak equipment usage, providing on-site repair services, scheduling off-season maintenance activities with customers, notifying customers of periodic service requirements and providing training programs to customers in order to educate them on standard maintenance requirements. Our after-market repair and maintenance services have historically provided a high-margin, relatively stable source of revenue through changing economic cycles. Service revenue represented 6.9%, 7.4%, and 7.9% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Equipment Rental and Other Business Activities
We rent equipment to our customers, primarily in the Construction segment, on a short-term basis for periods ranging from a few days to a few months. We actively manage the size, quality, age and composition of our rental fleet and closely monitor and analyze customer demand and rate trends. We maintain the quality of our fleet through our on-site parts and services support and dispose of rental equipment through our retail sales force. Our rental activities create cross-selling opportunities in equipment sales, including rent-to-own purchase options. In addition, we provide ancillary equipment support activities such as equipment transportation, Global Positioning System ("GPS") signal subscriptions and other precision farming products, farm data management products, and CNH Industrial finance and insurance products. Equipment rental and other revenue represented 4.3%, 4.7% and 4.6% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Industry Overview
Agricultural Equipment Industry
Agricultural equipment is purchased primarily by commercial farmers for the production of crops used for food, fiber, feed grain and feedstock for renewable energy. Agricultural equipment is also purchased by "life-style farmers" and for home and garden applications, and maintenance of commercial, residential and government properties. Deere & Company ("Deere"), CNH Industrial, and Agco Corporation ("AGCO") are the largest global manufacturers of agricultural equipment and they manufacture a full line of equipment and parts that supply the primary machinery requirements of farmers. In addition to the major manufacturers, several short-line manufacturers produce specialized equipment that satisfy regional and niche requirements of farmers. Agricultural equipment manufacturers typically grant dealers in the U.S. defined sales and marketing territories with designated store locations to distribute their products.
We believe there are many factors that influence demand for agricultural equipment, parts and repair and maintenance services, including net farm income, commodity markets, production yields, tariffs and trade policies, interest rates, government policies, tax policies, weather and general economic conditions. Any of these conditions can change materially in a short time period, creating volatility in demand for our products and services. Federal legislation, such as the Farm Bill, attempts to stabilize the agriculture industry through various policies including (i) commodity programs consisting of direct, counter-cyclical and price support payments to farmers; (ii) conservation programs; (iii) crop insurance programs; and (iv) disaster relief programs. We believe that these various federal policies reduce financial volatility in the agriculture industry and assist farmers in continuing to operate their farms during economic down cycles.
Construction Equipment Industry
Construction equipment is purchased primarily for use in commercial, residential and infrastructure construction, as well as for agriculture, demolition, mining, energy production and forestry operations. Caterpillar, Inc., Deere, Komatsu Ltd., the Volvo Group, Terex Corporation, Doosan, and CNH Industrial are some of the largest global manufacturers of construction and industrial equipment. The market for construction equipment is segmented across multiple categories including earth moving, lifting, light industrial, asphalt and paving, and concrete and aggregate equipment. As with agricultural equipment, distribution of construction equipment in the U.S. is accomplished primarily through manufacturer authorized dealers. 

2

CNH Industrial and industry reports show that demand for construction equipment in our markets is driven by several factors, including (i) public spending on roads, highways, sewer and water projects, and other public works projects; (ii) public and private expenditures for the energy and mining industries, which are driven in part by demand for fossil fuels, metals and other commodities; (iii) business conditions in the agriculture industry; and (iv) general economic and market conditions of the construction sector for residential and commercial buildings.
Business Strengths
We believe the following attributes are important factors in our ability to compete effectively and to achieve our long-term financial objectives:
Centralized Inventory Management
We believe our significant scale enables us to centrally manage our inventory, thus promoting inventory exchanges among our stores, permitting us to more effectively manage inventory levels at each store while still providing a significant breadth of equipment and parts inventories to our customers. Moreover, our floorplan financing capacity enables us to opportunistically acquire and carry inventory to satisfy market demands.
Superior Customer Service at the Local Level
Our actions to centralize numerous administrative functions has enabled our employees in the field to focus on customer service. We believe that the following capabilities enable us to better service our customers:

• | our ability to staff a large number of highly-trained service technicians across our network of stores, which makes it possible to schedule repair services on short notice without affecting our technician utilization rates;


• | our ability to staff and leverage product and application specialists across our network of stores, which makes it possible to offer valuable pre-sale and aftermarket services, including equipment training, best practices education and precision farming technology support; and


• | our ability to innovate and lead our industry through initiatives such as precision farming and farm data management products and services, which provide our customers with the latest advances in technology and operating practices.

We spend significant time and resources training our employees to effectively service our customers in each of our local markets. Our training program involves active participation in all manufacturer-sponsored training programs, the use of industry experts for customized training programs, and a centralized training team to assist in training programs and the integration of newly-acquired operations. We also partner with several technical colleges to sponsor students who we plan to eventually employ as service technicians.
Ability to Act on Acquisition Opportunities
We believe that our experienced management team and access to capital enables us to be opportunistic in responding to accretive growth opportunities, primarily arising from the continued consolidation of the dealer network. 
Superior Centralized Marketing Systems
Our shared resource group includes a professional marketing team that supports all aspects of brand and solution awareness, customer analytics and targeting, and lead generation through multichannel campaigns that typically incorporate digital marketing (email, website, search, social, syndication), direct mail, and regional and local advertising and sponsorships. Our marketing functions also drive increased customer engagement and loyalty through participation in trade shows and industry events and communication and coordination for local store open houses, service clinics, equipment demonstrations, product showcases and customer appreciation outings.
Ability to Attract and Retain Superior Employees.
We recognize that attracting and retaining talented employees is essential to achieving outstanding company performance. We strive to develop our employees through a structured training program, and to invest in their general development. In addition, we strive to implement a compensation system that rewards employees for high performance. We believe that our efforts in these areas will enable us to attract and retain superior employees, necessary for us to be successful in our industry. 
Diverse and Stable Customer Base Reduces Market Risk 
Our large geographic footprint covering 11 U.S. states and five European countries provides a diversified customer base. We believe that this diverse customer base reduces the potential impact of risks associated with customer concentration 
3

and fluctuations in local market conditions. During fiscal 2019, none of our customers accounted for more than 1.0% of our total revenue. Revenue from customers located outside of the United States is primarily included in our International segment, which represented 18.4%, 17.5% and 12.5% of total consolidated revenue during fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017. In addition, our large geographic footprint enables us to capitalize on crop diversification and disparate weather in growing regions, as well as local trends in residential, infrastructure and commercial construction. 
Experienced Management Team 
Our executive team is led by David Meyer, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer, who has over 40 years of industry experience. Our other executive team members, managers in the field, and equipment sales consultants also have extensive knowledge and experience in our industry. We compensate, develop and review our managers and sales employees based on an approach that aligns their incentives with the goals and objectives of our company, including achievement of revenue, profitability, market share and balance sheet objectives. We believe the strength of our management team will increase our success in the marketplace.
Growth Strategy
We pursue the following growth strategies:
Increasing Same-Store Sales and Market Share 
Increasing market share and same-store sales is a priority of ours. Such growth both enhances our current period revenue and increases our potential future revenue during the life of the sold equipment through recurring parts and service business. We seek to generate growth in same-store sales and market share through the following:

• | employing significant marketing and advertising programs, including targeted direct mailings, internet based marketing, advertising with targeted local media outlets, participation in and sponsorship of trade shows and industry events, our Titan Trader monthly magazine, and by hosting open houses, service clinics, equipment demonstrations, product showcases and customer appreciation outings;


• | supporting and providing customers with training on evolving technologies, such as precision farming and farm data management, which are difficult for small dealers to support;


• | maintaining state-of-the-art service facilities, mobile service trucks and trained service technicians to maximize our customers' equipment uptime through preventative maintenance programs and seasonal 24/7 service support; and


• | centrally managing our inventory to optimize the availability of equipment and parts for our customers.

Strategic Acquisitions
Since January 1, 2003, we have completed the acquisition of over 50 dealerships located in 11 states and four European countries. The agricultural and construction equipment industries are fragmented and consist of many relatively small, independent businesses serving discrete local markets. We believe a favorable climate for dealership consolidation will continue to exist in the future due to several factors, including the competitiveness of our industry, increased dealer capitalization requirements, increased sophistication and complexity of equipment and related technology, increased expectations from growers and original equipment manufacturers, and the lack of succession alternatives for current owners. We intend to continue to evaluate and pursue acquisitions with the objectives of entering new markets, consolidating distribution within our existing network, and strengthening our competitive position. We expect that opportunistic acquisitions will continue to be a component of our long-term growth strategy.
We regularly assess the acquisition landscape, evaluating potential acquisitions in terms of availability and alignment to our long-term growth strategy. Typically, we have acquired only the working capital and fixed assets that we believe are necessary to run an efficient store and we do not generally assume any indebtedness. On occasion, we have acquired all of the outstanding equity of a company. Acquisitions are typically financed with available cash balances, floorplan payable line of credit capacity, and long-term debt.
The consent of CNH Industrial is required to acquire any CNH Industrial dealership. The consent of our lender group, led by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (collectively referred to as "Wells Fargo"), is required for acquisitions meeting certain thresholds or other criteria as defined in our Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility, as amended (the "Wells Fargo Credit Agreement").

Suppliers
CNH Industrial—Case IH Agriculture, Case Construction, New Holland Agriculture and New Holland Construction
CNH Industrial is a publicly-traded, global leader in the agricultural and construction equipment industries based on industry market share data. In 2018, CNH Industrial generated $14.7 billion in revenue from its equipment operations. CNH Industrial is the world's second largest manufacturer of agricultural equipment, manufacturing the Case IH Agriculture and New Holland Agriculture brands of equipment. Case IH Agriculture, recognized by the red color of its equipment, possesses over 170 years of farm equipment heritage. New Holland Agriculture, recognized by the blue color of its tractors and the yellow color of its harvesting and hay equipment, has over 120 years of farm equipment industry experience. The Case Construction and New Holland Construction brands are owned and operated by CNH Industrial. 
In fiscal 2019, CNH Industrial supplied approximately 74% of the new equipment sold in our Agriculture segment, 70% of the new equipment sold in our Construction segment, and 72% of the new equipment sold in our International segment. In addition, CNH Industrial provides financing and insurance products and services to our end-user customers through its affiliated business unit, CNH Industrial Capital America, LLC ("CNH Industrial Capital"). 
 We believe that our relationship with CNH Industrial is more than a typical supply relationship; it is strategic for both our Company and CNH Industrial. In that regard, it is in each company's interest to maintain and develop the longstanding strong relationship we share.
Dealership Agreements
We have entered into separate dealership agreements with CNH Industrial to sell and service the Case IH Agriculture, New Holland Agriculture, Case Construction and New Holland Construction brands (collectively the “CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements”). Separate CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements exist for each of our North American stores or store complexes, and for each of the European countries in which we operate. The structure of the North American and European agreements are very similar. Except as noted, the following discussion describes the North American CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements. 
The CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements assign to us a geographically defined area of principal responsibility, providing us with distribution and product support rights within the identified territory for specific equipment products. Although the dealer appointment is non-exclusive, in each territory there is typically only one dealer responsible for retail sales to end-users and for after-sales product support of the equipment. If we sell certain CNH Industrial equipment outside of our designated sales and service areas, CNH Industrial has the right to require that we pay sales and service fees for purposes of compensating the dealer assigned to such territory. We are authorized to display and use CNH Industrial trademarks and trade names at our stores, with certain restrictions.
Under our CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements, we have both the right and obligation to sell CNH Industrial equipment and related parts and products and to provide customers with repair services. The CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements impose various requirements on us regarding the location and appearance of facilities, satisfactory levels of new equipment and parts inventories, the training of personnel, adequate business enterprise and information technology system, adequate working capital, a maximum adjusted debt to tangible net worth ratio, development of annual sales and marketing goals, and furnishing of monthly and annual financial information to CNH Industrial. We must obtain the approval or consent of CNH Industrial in the event of proposed fundamental changes to our ownership, governance or business structure (defined as "change in control" events) including, among other things, (i) a merger, consolidation or reorganization, unless securities representing more than 50% of the total combined voting power of the successor corporation are immediately owned, directly or indirectly, by persons that owned our securities prior to the transaction; (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets; (iii) any transaction or series of transactions resulting in a person or affiliated group acquiring 30% or more of the combined voting power of our securities or, in the case of a competitor of CNH Industrial, 20% or more of the combined voting power of our securities; (iv) a substantial disposition of shares of our common stock by certain named executives; (v) certain significant changes in the composition of our Board of Directors; and (vi) replacement of our Chief Executive Officer. The CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements do not establish mandatory minimum or maximum retail pricing for our equipment or parts sales or service offerings.
The Case IH Agricultural dealership agreement and the Case Construction dealership agreement have fixed terms expiring on December 31, 2027, and renew automatically for successive 5-year terms unless either party notifies the other party of its intention not to renew or otherwise exercises its termination rights under the agreement. The New Holland dealership agreement has a fixed term expiring December 31, 2019, with automatic 1-year renewals unless either party notifies the other party of its intention not to renew or otherwise exercises its termination rights under the agreement. 
CNH Industrial has the right to terminate its dealer agreements with us immediately in certain circumstances, including in the event of (i) our insolvency or bankruptcy, (ii) a material breach by us of the provisions of a CNH Industrial 
5

Dealer Agreement or (iii) our failure to secure the consent of CNH Industrial prior to the occurrence of “change in control” events. The CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements governing Case Construction equipment grants CNH Industrial the right to terminate these CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements for any reason upon 120 days prior written notice. In addition, we have the right to terminate any of the CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements at any time, with or without cause, upon 60 days prior written notice. Subject to protections provided under state dealer protection laws, in the event that CNH Industrial offers a new dealer agreement or an amendment to the existing CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements to all authorized CNH Industrial dealers located in the state, CNH Industrial is permitted to terminate our existing CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements for stores located in that state upon at least 180 days prior written notice if we refuse or otherwise fail to enter into such new agreements or amendments. In addition, to the extent CNH Industrial determines that we are not meeting our obligations under the CNH Industrial Dealer Agreement with respect to a particular product, CNH Industrial may, upon 60 days prior written notice to us, remove such product from the authorized product list allowed to be sold or serviced by us. In the event of termination of any of the CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements, CNH Industrial is obligated to repurchase the inventory of the CNH Industrial brand applicable to the agreement being terminated. The CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements generally do not include non-compete provisions that apply during or after the term of such agreements or limit our operations apart from our designated CNH Industrial dealership store locations. Our CNH Dealer Agreements for Case Construction equipment, absent consent of CNH Industrial, restrict our ability to sell competing products (new equipment and parts) of other manufacturers at our Case dealership store locations during the term of such agreements. Our CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements require us to operate any material business activities not related to sales of CNH Industrial products or services to customers in agricultural, construction, industrial or similar markets separately from our CNH Industrial dealership business.
The CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements and industry practices generally provide that payment on equipment and parts purchased from CNH Industrial entities is due within 30 days and equipment inventory is typically subject to floorplan payable financing. CNH Industrial makes available to us any floorplan programs, parts return programs, sales or incentive programs or similar plans or programs it offers to its other dealers, and provides us with promotional items and marketing materials.
The CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements for our European operations grant to us exclusive territories. In turn, we are restricted in our ability to sell competing products in our assigned territories. Our CNH Dealer Agreements of our European operations do not have a fixed term. CNH Industrial can terminate these agreements immediately in certain circumstances constituting cause, and for any reason upon twenty-four (24) months' prior written notice. 
 Other Suppliers
In addition to products supplied by CNH Industrial, we sell a variety of new equipment and parts inventories supplied by other manufacturers. These products tend to address specialized niche markets and complement the CNH Industrial products we sell by filling gaps in the CNH Industrial line of products. We believe our offering of products for specialized niche markets supports our goal of being a one-stop solution for equipment needs at each of our stores. Approximately 28% of our total new equipment sales in fiscal 2019 resulted from sales of products manufactured by companies other than CNH Industrial, with our single largest manufacturer other than CNH Industrial representing approximately 3% of our total new equipment sales. The terms of our arrangements with these other suppliers vary, but most of the dealership agreements contain termination provisions allowing the supplier to terminate the agreement after a specified notice period, which is typically 30 days. Payment and financing practices with these other suppliers are similar to those practices described above with respect to the CNH Industrial entities.
Customers
Our North America agriculture customers vary from small, single machine owners to large farming operations, primarily in the states of Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. In fiscal 2019, no single agriculture customer accounted for more than 1.0% of our Agriculture revenue.
Our Construction customers include a wide range of construction contractors, public utilities, mining, forestry, and energy companies, farmers, municipalities and maintenance contractors, primarily in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming. They vary in size from small, single machine owners to large firms. In fiscal 2019, no single construction equipment customer accounted for more than 2.0% of our Construction revenue.
Our International customers vary from small, single machine owners to large farming operations, primarily in the European countries of Bulgaria, Germany, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine. We also sell Case construction equipment in Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine. In fiscal 2019, no single international customer accounted for more than 4.0% of our International revenue.

Floorplan Payable Financing
We attempt to maintain at each store, or have readily available at other stores in our network, sufficient new equipment inventory to satisfy customer demand. Inventory levels fluctuate throughout the year and tend to increase before the primary sales seasons for agricultural equipment. The cost of floorplan payable financing is an important factor affecting our financial results.
CNH Industrial Capital offers floorplan payable financing to CNH Industrial dealers to finance the purchase of inventory from CNH Industrial and for used equipment inventory purchased on trade-ins from our customers. CNH Industrial Capital provides this financing in part to enable dealers to carry representative inventories of equipment and encourage the purchase of goods by dealers in advance of seasonal retail demand. CNH Industrial Capital charges variable market rates of interest based on the prime rate on balances outstanding after any interest-free periods and receives a security interest in inventory and other assets. Interest-free periods are generally about four months in duration for both new and used agriculture and construction equipment. CNH Industrial Capital also provides floorplan financing for used equipment accepted in trade, repossessed equipment and approved equipment from other suppliers, and receives a security interest in such equipment. As of January 31, 2019, we had a $400.0 million floorplan credit facility with CNH Industrial Capital. 
In addition to the CNH Industrial Capital floorplan line of credit, as of January 31, 2019, we also had a $140.0 million wholesale floorplan line of credit under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement, and a $45.0 million credit facility with DLL Finance LLC that can be used to finance inventory purchases. In addition, we have other lines of credit offered by various financial institutions as well as floorplan payable financing programs offered by manufacturers and suppliers, or their third party lenders, from which we purchase equipment inventory.
Sales and Marketing
We currently market our products and services through:

• | our sales employees, who operate out of our network of local stores and call on customers in the markets surrounding each store;


• | our area product support managers, and our store parts managers and service managers, who provide our customers with comprehensive after-market support;


• | our website;


• | local and regional advertising efforts, including broadcast, cable, print and web-based media; and


• | alternative channels, such as auctions, for selling our aged equipment inventories.

Equipment Sales Consultants and Centralized Support
Our equipment sales employees (who hold the job title "equipment sales consultant") perform a variety of functions, such as servicing customers at our stores, calling on existing customers, and soliciting new business at farming, construction and industrial sites. We develop customized marketing programs for our sales force by analyzing each customer group for profitability, buying behavior and product selection. All members of our sales force are expected to participate in internal and external manufacturer-sponsored training sessions to develop product and application knowledge, sales techniques and financial acumen. Our shared resources group provides centralized sales and marketing support for our field operations, and coordinates centralized media buys, strategic planning, sales support and training. In addition, we enable our regional and area managers and their sales teams to develop localized sales and marketing strategies.
Parts Managers and Service Managers
Our parts managers and service managers are involved in our efforts to market parts and service, taking advantage of our seasonal marketing campaigns in parts and service sales. As a group, they have won multiple awards from our suppliers for their efforts benefiting both our customers and our key suppliers. 
Website
Our used equipment inventories are marketed on our website, www.titanmachinery.com, through an equipment search feature which allows users to search by equipment type, manufacturer, price and/or store. A picture of each piece of equipment is shown, along with the equipment specifications, price and store location. Parts manufactured by the CNH Industrial brands are marketed and can be purchased directly through our website. Other sales and financing programs are also marketed through our website. Finally, our website provides dealer locator search functions and provides the contact information for the various departments at each of our stores.
7

Print, Broadcast and Web-Based Advertising Campaigns
Each year we initiate several targeted direct mail, print and broadcast advertising and marketing campaigns. CNH Industrial and other suppliers periodically provide us with advertising funds, which we primarily use to promote new equipment, parts and financing programs. We will continue to explore and launch additional sales channels as appropriate, including, for example, additional internet-based efforts.
Channels for Selling Aged Equipment Inventory
In certain circumstances, we sell aged equipment inventories through the use of alternative channels such as onsite and online auctions.
Competition
The agricultural and construction equipment sales and distribution industries are highly competitive and fragmented, with large numbers of companies operating on a regional or local scale. Our competitors range from multi-location, regional operators to single-location dealers and include dealers and distributors of competing equipment brands, including Deere, Caterpillar and the AGCO brands, as well as other dealers and distributors of the CNH Industrial family of brands. Competition among equipment dealers, whether they offer agricultural or construction products or both, is primarily based on the price, value, reputation, quality and design of the products, customer service including repair and maintenance service provided by the dealer, the availability of equipment and parts, and the accessibility of stores. While we believe we compete favorably on each of these competitive factors, our sales and margins may be impacted by (i) aggressive pricing competition through manufacturer discount programs or other competitive pricing tactics, (ii) our ability to obtain higher service margins based on our service quality and reputation, and (iii) our ability to attract new and maintain existing customers based on the availability and quality of the products we offer and our local relationships and reputation.
We are one of the principal regional-scale agricultural and construction equipment dealers in the U.S. and Europe. The number of other agricultural and construction equipment dealers operating on a regional scale is limited. Our primary regional-scale competitors include RDO Equipment Co., Butler Machinery, Ziegler Inc., Brandt Holdings Co., Wagner Equipment Co., and Van Wall Equipment. 
Corporate Information
We were incorporated as a North Dakota corporation in 1980 and reincorporated in Delaware in December 2007 prior to our initial public offering. Our executive offices are located at 644 East Beaton Drive, West Fargo, ND 58078-2648. Our telephone number is (701) 356-0130. We maintain a website at www.titanmachinery.com. Our SEC filings are available on the Investor Relations page of our website or at www.sec.gov.
Intellectual Property
We have registered trademarks for certain names and designs used in our business and have trademark applications pending for certain others. We generally operate each of our stores under the Titan Machinery name. Case IH, Case and New Holland are registered trademarks of CNH Industrial, which we use in connection with advertisements and sales as authorized under our CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements. We also license trademarks and trade names of new equipment from other suppliers of equipment to us.
Product Warranties
Product warranties for new equipment and parts are provided by the original equipment manufacturer ("OEM"). The term and scope of these warranties vary greatly by OEM and by product. At the time equipment is purchased, we also offer customers the option of purchasing extended warranty protection provided by the OEM or through various third-party warranty providers. We are paid by the OEM for repairs we perform to equipment under warranty. We generally sell used equipment "as is" and without OEM warranty unless the original warranty period has not expired and is transferable. We also offer extended warranty programs on certain used equipment through various third-party warranty providers.
Seasonality & Weather
The agricultural and construction equipment businesses are highly seasonal, which causes our quarterly results and our cash flow to fluctuate during the year. Our customers generally purchase and rent equipment in preparation for, or in conjunction with, their busy seasons. For farmers, the busy seasons are spring planting and fall harvesting. For Construction customers, the busy season is typically the second and third quarters of our fiscal year for much of our Construction footprint, subject to weather conditions. Our parts and service revenues are typically highest during our customers' busy seasons as well, due to the increased use of their equipment during this time, which generates the need for more parts and service work. Weather 
8

conditions impact the timing of our customers' busy times, which may cause our quarterly financial results to differ between fiscal years. In addition, the fourth quarter typically is a significant period for equipment sales in the U.S. because of our customers’ year-end tax planning considerations, the timing of dealer incentives and the increase in availability of funds from completed harvests and construction projects.
Seasonal weather trends, particularly severe wet or dry conditions, can have a significant impact on regional agricultural and construction market performance by affecting crop production yields and the ability to undertake construction projects. Weather conditions that adversely affect the agricultural or construction markets would have a negative effect on the demand for our products and services.
In addition, numerous external factors such as credit markets, commodity prices, production yields, and other circumstances may disrupt normal purchasing practices and buyer sentiment, further contributing to the seasonal fluctuations.
Employees
As of January 31, 2019, we employed 1,550 full-time and 111 part-time employees. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
Governmental Regulation
We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local rules and regulations, including regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency and similar state agencies, with respect to storing, shipping, disposing, discharging and handling hazardous materials and hazardous and non-hazardous waste. The environmental regulations applicable to us are associated with the repair and maintenance of equipment at our stores including the handling and disposal of oil, fluids, wastewater and solvent cleaners. Currently, none of our stores or operations exceeds small quantity generation status. Compliance with these rules and regulations has not had any material effect on our operations, nor do we expect it to in the future. Further, we have not made, and do not anticipate making, any material capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations.
