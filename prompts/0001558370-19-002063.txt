 Item 1.     Business
 Our History
 Cactus Inc. was incorporated on February 17, 2017 as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of completing an initial public offering of equity and related transactions (our “IPO”). Cactus LLC is a Delaware limited liability company and was formed on July 11, 2011. We began operating in August 2011, following the formation of Cactus LLC by Scott Bender and Joel Bender, who have owned or operated wellhead manufacturing businesses since the late 1970s, and Cadent Energy Partners II, L.P. (“Cadent”), an affiliate of Cadent Energy Partners LLC, as its equity sponsor. We acquired our primary manufacturing facility in Bossier City, Louisiana in September 2011 and established our other production facility, located in Suzhou, China, in December 2013 through our subsidiary there. Since we began operating, we have grown to 15 U.S. service centers located in Texas, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, North Dakota, New Mexico, Louisiana, Colorado and Wyoming. In July 2014, we formed a subsidiary in Australia and established a service center to develop the market for our products in Eastern Australia. Our corporate headquarters are located in Houston, Texas.
 Cactus Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Cactus LLC, are primarily engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of wellhead and pressure control equipment. In addition, we maintain a fleet of frac valves and ancillary equipment for short-term rental. Our products are sold and rented principally for onshore unconventional oil and gas wells and are utilized during the drilling, completion and production phases of our customers’ wells. We also provide field services for all of our products and rental items to assist with the installation, maintenance and handling of the wellhead and pressure control equipment as well as offer repair and refurbishment services. 
 Organization Structure
 Cactus Inc. is a holding company whose only material asset is an equity interest consisting of units representing limited liability company interests in Cactus LLC (“CW Units”). Cactus Inc. became the sole managing member of Cactus LLC upon completion of our IPO and is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions relating to Cactus LLC’s business. The Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of Cactus LLC was amended and restated as the First Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of Cactus LLC (the “Cactus Wellhead LLC Agreement”) to, among other things, admit Cactus Inc. as the sole managing member of Cactus LLC. Pursuant to the Cactus Wellhead LLC Agreement, holders of CW Units are entitled to redeem their CW Units which results in a corresponding increase in Cactus Inc.’s membership interest in Cactus LLC, and an increase in the number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding. 
 On February 12, 2018, we completed our initial public offering of 23,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class A common stock”), at a price to the public of $19.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $408.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and payment of $2.8 million in 2018 offering expenses for the IPO. We also paid $2.2 million in offering expenses during 2017 that were recorded to prepaid expenses in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. On February 14, 2018 we completed the sale of an additional 3,450,000 shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock (the “Option”), from which we received an additional $61.6 million net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. We contributed all of the net proceeds of our IPO (including from the Option) to Cactus LLC in exchange for CW Units.

 Cactus LLC used $469.6 million of the net proceeds from our IPO to (i) repay all of the borrowings outstanding under its term loan facility, including accrued interest, of $251.0 million and (ii) redeem $216.4 million of CW Units from certain direct and indirect owners of Cactus LLC. The remaining $2.2 million was held by Cactus LLC to cover offering expenses previously paid in 2017.
 On July 16, 2018, we completed a public offering of 11,196,562 shares (consisting of 10,000,000 base shares and 1,196,562 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) of Class A common stock (the “Follow-on Offering”) at a price to the public of $33.25 per share and received $359.3 million of net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. Cactus Inc. contributed these net proceeds to Cactus LLC in exchange for CW Units. Cactus LLC then used the net proceeds to redeem 11,196,562 CW Units from certain of the owners of Cactus LLC, and Cactus Inc. canceled a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class B common stock”). 
 Pursuant to the Cactus Wellhead LLC Agreement, holders of CW Units are entitled to redeem their CW Units which results in a corresponding increase in Cactus Inc.’s membership interest in Cactus LLC, and an increase in the number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding. Pursuant to the Cactus Wellhead LLC Agreement, there were redemptions of 7,068 CW Units during the fourth quarter 2018. Future quarterly redemptions are also expected.
 In this Annual Report, we refer to the owners of CW Units, other than Cactus Inc., (along with their permitted transferees) as “CW Unit Holders.”  CW Unit Holders also own one share of our Class B common stock for each CW Unit such CW Unit Holder owns. As of December 31, 2018, after giving effect to our IPO, Follow-on Offering and the related transactions, Cactus Inc. owns an approximate 50.3% interest in Cactus LLC, and the CW Unit Holders own an approximate 49.7% interest in Cactus LLC. These ownership percentages are based on 37,653,630 shares of Class A common stock and 37,236,142 shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2018.

 The following diagram indicates our simplified ownership structure.

 Overview
 Our principal products include our Cactus SafeDrill® wellhead systems as well as frac stacks, zipper manifolds and production trees that we design and manufacture. Every oil and gas well requires a wellhead, which is installed at the onset of the drilling process that remains with the well through its entire productive life. The Cactus SafeDrill® wellhead systems employ technology which allows technicians to land and secure casing strings more safely from the rig floor, reducing the need to descend into the cellar. We believe we are a market leader in the application of such technology, with thousands of our products sold and installed across the United States since 2011. During the completion phase of a well, we rent frac stacks, zipper manifolds and other high-pressure equipment that are used for well control

and for managing the transmission of frac fluids and proppants during the hydraulic fracturing process. These severe service applications require robust and reliable equipment. For the subsequent production phase of a well, we sell production trees that regulate hydrocarbon production, which are installed on the wellhead after the frac stack has been removed. In addition, we provide mission-critical field services for all of our products and rental items, including 24-hour service crews to assist with the installation, maintenance, repair and safe handling of the wellhead and pressure control equipment. 
 Our innovative wellhead products and pressure control equipment are developed internally. We believe our close relationship with our customers provides us with insight into the specific issues encountered in the drilling and completion processes, allowing us to provide them appropriate product and service solutions. We have achieved significant market share, as measured by the percentage of total active U.S. onshore rigs that we follow (which we define as the number of active U.S. onshore drilling rigs to which we are the primary provider of wellhead products and corresponding services during drilling), and brand name recognition with respect to our engineered products, which we believe is due to our focus on safety, reliability, cost effectiveness and time saving features. We optimize our products for pad drilling (i.e., the process of drilling multiple wellbores from a single surface location) to reduce rig time and provide operators with significant efficiencies that translate to cost savings at the wellsite. 
 We operate 15 service centers in the United States, which are strategically located in the key oil and gas producing regions, including the Permian, SCOOP/STACK, Marcellus, Utica, Eagle Ford, Bakken and other active oil and gas regions in the United States. We also have one service center in Eastern Australia. These service centers support our field services and provide equipment assembly and repair services.
 How We Generate Our Revenues
 Our revenues are derived from three sources: products, rentals, and field service and other. Product revenues are primarily derived from the sale of wellhead systems and production trees. Rental revenues are primarily derived from the rental and associated repair of equipment used for well control during the completion process as well as the rental of drilling tools. Field service and other revenues are primarily earned when we provide installation and other field services for both product sales and equipment rental. Additionally, other revenues are derived from providing repair and reconditioning services to customers that have previously installed our products on their wellsite. Items sold or rented generally have an associated service component. As a result, there is some level of correlation between field service and other revenues and revenues from product sales and rentals.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived 53% of our total revenues from the sale of our products, 25% of our total revenues from rental and 22% of our total revenues from field service and other. In 2017, we derived 55% of our total revenues from the sale of our products, 23% of our total revenues from rental and 22% of our total revenues from field service and other. We have predominantly domestic operations, with 99% of our total sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 earned from U.S. operations. 
 Most all of our sales are made on a call out basis pursuant to agreements, wherein our clients provide delivery instructions for goods and/or services as their operations require. Such goods and/or services are most often priced in accordance with a preapproved price list.

 The actual pricing of our products and services is impacted by a number of factors including competitive pricing pressure, the level of utilized capacity in the oil service sector, maintenance of market share, cost of producing the product and general market conditions.
 Costs of Conducting Our Business
 The principal elements of cost of sales for our products are the direct and indirect costs to manufacture and supply the product, including labor, materials, machine time, freight and lease expense related to our facilities. The principal elements of cost of sales for rentals are the direct and indirect costs of supplying rental equipment, including depreciation, repairs specifically performed on such rental equipment and freight. The principal elements of cost of sales for field service and other are labor, equipment depreciation and repair, equipment lease expense, fuel and supplies.
 Selling, general and administrative expense is comprised of costs such as sales and marketing, engineering expenses, general corporate overhead, business development expenses, compensation expense, stock-based compensation expense, IT expenses, safety and environmental expenses, legal and professional expenses and other related administrative functions.
 Interest expense, net is currently comprised primarily of interest expense associated with our Prior Credit Agreement (as defined below), our ABL Credit Facility (as defined below) and capital leases. A portion of the net proceeds of our IPO were used to repay the borrowings outstanding under our Prior Credit Agreement in February 2018.
 Impact of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (“Section 232”)
 On March 8, 2018, the President of the United States issued two proclamations imposing tariffs on imports of certain steel and aluminum products, effective March 23, 2018. The decision was made in response to the Department of Commerce's findings and recommendations in its reports of its investigations into the impact of imported steel and aluminum on the national security of the United States pursuant to Section 232. Specifically, the President imposed a 25 percent global tariff on certain imported steel mill products and a 10 percent global tariff on certain imported aluminum products. On March 8, 2018 and March 22, 2018, the President issued proclamations temporarily exempting Mexico, Canada, Australia, Argentina, South Korea, Brazil and the European Union from the global steel and aluminum tariffs to imports until May 1, 2018. The President subsequently announced that the United States had successfully concluded discussions with South Korea on satisfactory alternative means to address U.S. national security threats posed by steel article imports from South Korea, thereby permanently excluding South Korea from the steel tariff, and had agreed in principle with Argentina, Australia and Brazil on satisfactory alternative means to address U.S. national security threats posed by steel and aluminum articles imported from those countries, and thus extended the temporary exemption of steel and aluminum products from those countries until details of those agreements are finalized and implemented. On May 31, 2018, the President issued proclamations permanently excluding Argentina, Australia and Brazil from the steel tariff and Argentina and Australia from the aluminum tariff, though imports of steel from Argentina and Brazil, as well as South Korea, and imports of aluminum from Argentina are subject to absolute quotas. Though the President had temporarily exempted tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico, on May 31, 2018, the President opted to not extend such exemptions and as a result, imports of steel and aluminum from the European Union, Canada, and Mexico are subject to tariffs effective June 1, 2018. The tariffs and quotas have caused the cost of raw materials to increase.

 Impact of Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (“Section 301”)
 On September 21, 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (‘‘USTR’’) determined to modify its prior actions in its investigation into certain acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation pursuant to Section 301 by imposing additional tariffs on products of China. Substantially all of the products that we import through our Chinese supply chain are subject to the tariffs that took effect on September 24, 2018. In the three months ended December 31, 2018, we estimate that 50% of our inventory received was sourced through our Chinese supply chain. These aforementioned tariffs were set at a level of 10% until the end of 2018, at which point the tariffs were to increase to 25%. However, on December 19, 2018, the USTR postponed the date on which the rate of the additional duties would increase to 25% until March 2, 2019. The USTR announced on March 5, 2019 that the rate of additional duty will remain at 10% until further notice. We believe that a combination of factors could largely offset the impact of these increases or potential increases in the tariff rate on our results of operations, including, among other things, our negotiations with customers and suppliers, favorable currency exchange expectations and our expected future growth but there can be no assurance that the impact will not be significant to us. We believe these increases in the tariff rate should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there remains significant uncertainty as to the degree of any adverse impact.  
 Suppliers and Raw Materials
 Forgings, castings and bar stock represent the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products and rental equipment. In addition, we require accessory items (such as elastomers, ring gaskets, studs and nuts) and machining services. We purchase these items and services from over 250 vendors, both in the United States and China. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, approximately $46.7 million, $33.4 million and $10.8 million, respectively, of machined component purchases were made from a vendor located in China, representing approximately 21%, 22% and 20%, respectively, of our total third-party vendor purchases of raw materials, finished products, equipment, machining and other services. Although we historically made purchases from this vendor pursuant to a long term contract, such contract expired at the end of 2016. We are currently purchasing from this vendor on terms substantially similar to those contained in the expired agreement. While our relationships with our existing vendors, including the Chinese vendor referred to above, are important to us, we do not believe that we are overly dependent on any individual vendor to supply our required materials or services. The materials and services essential to our business are normally readily available and, where we use one or a few vendors as a source of any particular materials or services, we believe that we can, within a reasonable period of time, make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of an interruption of supply from any vendor.
 We believe that our materials and services vendors have the capacity to meet additional demand should we require it, although likely at higher costs and delayed deliveries.
 Manufacturing
 Our manufacturing and production facilities are located in Bossier City, Louisiana and Suzhou, China. Although both facilities can produce our full range of products, our Bossier City facility has advanced capabilities and is designed to support time-sensitive and rapid turnaround orders, while our facility in China is optimized for longer lead time orders and outsources its machining requirements. Both our Bossier City and China facilities are licensed to the latest American Petroleum Institute (“API”) 6A specification for both wellheads and valves and API Q1 and ISO9001:2015 quality management systems. 
 Our Bossier City facility is configured to provide rapid-response production of made-to-order equipment. Where traditional manufacturing facilities are designed to run in batches with different machining processes occurring in stages, this facility uses advanced computer numeric control (or CNC) machines to perform multiple machining operations in a single step. We believe eliminating the setup and queue times between machining processes allows us to 

 
  6

 
offer significantly shorter order-to-delivery time for equipment than our competitors, albeit at higher costs than China. Responsiveness to urgent needs strengthens our relationship with key customers. 
 Our Bossier City manufacturing facility also functions as a repair and testing facility with its API 6A PSL3 certification and full QA/QC department. The facility also has the ability to perform hydrostatic testing, phosphate and oiling, copper coating and frac valve remanufacturing. 
 Our production facility in China is configured to efficiently produce our range of pressure control products and components for less time-sensitive, higher-volume orders. All employees in our Suzhou facility are Cactus employees, which we believe is a key factor in ensuring high quality. Our Suzhou facility currently assembles and tests some machined components before shipment to Cactus facilities in the United States and Australia.
 Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 Trademarks are important to the marketing of our products. We consider the Cactus Wellhead trademark to be important to our business as a whole. Additionally, the SafeDrill® trademark is complementary to our marketing efforts and brand recognition. These trademarks are registered in the United States.
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. To protect our information, we customarily enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and suppliers. There can be no assurance, however, that others will not independently obtain similar information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. 
 We have been awarded several U.S. Patents and currently have patent applications pending. We seek to protect our technology through use of patent protections, although we do not deem patents to be critical to our success. 
 Cyclicality
 We are substantially dependent on conditions in the oil and gas industry, including the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies. The level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which has historically been volatile, and by capital spending discipline practiced by customers.
 Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could negatively affect the level of these activities and capital spending, which could adversely affect demand for our products and services and, in certain instances, result in the cancellation, modification or rescheduling of existing and expected orders and the ability of our customers to pay us for our products and services. These factors could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.
 Seasonality
 Our business is not significantly impacted by seasonality, although our fourth quarter has historically been impacted by holidays and our clients’ budget cycles.
 Customers
 We serve over 200 customers representing majors, independents and other oil and gas companies with operations in the key U.S. oil and gas producing basins including the Permian, SCOOP/STACK, Marcellus, Utica, Eagle Ford, Bakken and other active oil and gas basins, as well as in Australia. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, Pioneer Natural Resources represented 11% of our total revenue and no other customer represented 10% or more 

 
  7

 
of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Devon Energy Corporation represented 12% of our total revenue, and no other customer represented 10% or more of our total revenue.
 Competition
 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We believe that we are one of the largest suppliers of wellheads in the United States. We compete with divisions of Schlumberger, Baker Hughes a GE company, TechnipFMC and Weir as well as with a number of smaller companies. We believe that the wellhead market is relatively concentrated, with Cactus, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes representing over 50% of the market. Similar to Cactus, each of Schlumberger, Baker Hughes and TechnipFMC manufacture their own engineered products.
 We believe that the rental market for frac stacks and related flow control equipment is more fragmented than the wellhead product market. Cactus does not believe that any individual company represents more than 20% of the U.S. market. As is the case in the wellhead market, Cactus, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes and TechnipFMC rent internally engineered and manufactured products. Other competitors generally rent foreign manufactured generic products.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve are technical features, equipment availability, work force competency, efficiency, safety record, reputation, experience and price. Additionally, projects are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to create a highly competitive environment. While we seek to be competitive in our pricing, we believe many of our customers elect to work with us based on product features, safety, performance and quality of our crews, equipment and services. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by delivering the highest‑quality services and equipment possible, coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency in a safe working environment.
 Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation
 We are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations, both in the United States and other countries, pertaining to protection of the environment and occupational safety and health.  Compliance with environmental legal requirements in the United States at the federal, state or local levels may require acquiring permits to conduct regulated activities, incurring capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions, discharges and any unauthorized releases, and complying with stringent practices to handle, recycle and dispose of certain wastes. These laws and regulations include, among others:
· | the Federal Water Pollution Control Act;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | the Federal Clean Air Act;
--+---------------------------


· | the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | the Occupational Safety and Health Act; and
--+--------------------------------------------


· | national and local environmental protection laws in the People’s Republic of China.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  New, modified or stricter enforcement of environmental laws and regulations could be adopted or implemented that significantly increase our compliance costs, pollution mitigation costs, or the cost of any remediation of environmental contamination that may become necessary, and these costs could be material. Our clients are also subject to most, if not all, of the same laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health in the United States and in foreign countries where we operate. Consequently, to the extent these environmental 

 
  8

 
compliance costs, pollution mitigation costs or remedial costs are incurred by our clients, those clients could elect to delay, restrict or cancel drilling, exploration or production programs, which could reduce demand for our products and services and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 Consistent with our quality assurance and control principles, we have established proactive environmental and worker safety policies in the United States and foreign countries for the management, handling, recycling or disposal of chemicals and gases and other materials and wastes resulting from our operations.  Substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
 API Certifications. Our manufacturing facility and our production facility are currently certified by the API as being in compliance with API 6A specification for both wellheads and valves and API Q1 and ISO9001:2015 quality management systems. API’s standards are subject to revision, however, and there is no guarantee that future amendments or substantive changes to the standards would not require us to modify our operations or manufacturing processes to meet the new standards. Doing so may materially affect our operation costs. We also cannot guarantee that changes to the standards would not lead to the rescission of our licenses should we be unable to make the changes necessary to meet the new standards. Furthermore, these facilities are subjected to annual audits by the API. Loss of our API licenses could materially affect demand for these products.
 Hydraulic Fracturing. Many of our customers utilize hydraulic fracturing in their operations. Environmental concerns have been raised regarding the potential impact of hydraulic fracturing on underground water supplies and seismic activity. These concerns have led to several regulatory and governmental initiatives in the United States to restrict the hydraulic fracturing process, which could have an adverse impact on our customers’ completions or production activities.  
     Although we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing, increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. In addition, the adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal, state, local or foreign level imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, delaying or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process or other processes on which hydraulic fracturing relies, such as water disposal, could make it more difficult to complete oil and natural gas wells, increase our customers’ costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our products.
 Climate Change. State, national and international governments and agencies continue to evaluate, and in some instances adopt, climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases. Changes in environmental requirements related to greenhouse gases, climate change and alternative energy sources may negatively impact demand for our services. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements, including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, may reduce demand for oil and natural gas and could have a negative impact on our business. Likewise, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.
 Insurance and Risk Management
 We rely on customer indemnifications and third‑party insurance as part of our risk mitigation strategy. However, our customers may be unable to satisfy indemnification claims against them. In addition, we indemnify our customers against certain claims and liabilities resulting or arising from our provision of goods or services to them. Our 

 
  9

 
insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or may not cover all losses. We carry a variety of insurance coverages for our operations, and we are partially self‑insured for certain claims, in amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable. Historically, insurance rates have been subject to various market fluctuations that may result in less coverage, increased premium costs, or higher deductibles or self‑insured retentions.
 Our insurance includes coverage for commercial general liability, damage to our real and personal property, damage to our mobile equipment, sudden and accidental pollution liability, workers’ compensation and employer’s liability, auto liability, foreign package policy, excess liability, and directors and officers insurance. Our insurance includes various limits and deductibles or self‑insured retentions, which must be met prior to, or in conjunction with, recovery. To cover potential pollution risks, our commercial general liability policy is endorsed with sudden and accidental coverage and our excess liability policies provide additional limits of liability for covered sudden and accidental pollution losses.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed over 1,200 people. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
