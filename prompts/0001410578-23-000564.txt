ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Overview
Roth CH Acquisition IV Co. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 13, 2019. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to herein as our initial business combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to our initial public offering and our search for an initial business combination. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to focus our search on target businesses operating in the business services, consumer, healthcare, technology, wellness or sustainability sectors.
The Registration Statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on August 5, 2021 (the “Initial Public Offering” or “IPO”). On August 10, 2021, the Company consummated the IPO of 11,500,000 units (the “Units”), including 1,500,000 issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters in the IPO of their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value (“Common Stock”), and one-half of one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling the holder of each whole Warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $115.0 million, and incurring transaction costs of approximately $1.65 million, consisting of $1.15 million of underwriting fees and approximately $0.5 million of other offering costs of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A and 5T.
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we completed the private sale of 461,500 Units (the “Private Units”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Unit (the “Private Placement”), to certain initial stockholders of the Company, generating gross proceeds of $4,615,000. Except with respect to certain registration rights and transfer restrictions, the Private Units are identical to the Units sold as part of the public units in the Initial Public Offering.
Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the private placement (including the exercise of the over-allotment option), a total of $116,725,000 ($10.15 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the IPO and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement were placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in U.S. “government securities,” within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of one hundred eighty-five (185) days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the Trust Account, other than to pay our income or other tax obligations until the earlier of the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination and the distribution of the Trust Account as otherwise permitted under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement.
If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or by July 10, 2023, if we extend the time to complete a business combination), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining holders of common stock and our Board of Directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law.

We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the JOBS Act). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC rules from time to time), or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. As an emerging growth company, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
Proposed Business Combination
On December 5, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), with Roth IV Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Tigo Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Tigo Energy”). The transactions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the merger of Merger Sub with and into Tigo Energy, with Tigo Energy surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”), will constitute a “Business Combination” as contemplated by the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Upon the closing and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Company will change its name to “Tigo Energy, Inc.” On December 30, 2022, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-4 including a preliminary proxy statement/prospectus with the SEC for the purpose of soliciting stockholder approval of the proposed Business Combination with Tigo Energy at a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the parties thereto with respect to the parties, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and their respective business operations and activities. 
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into the Sponsor Support Agreement with the Sponsor Parties (as defined the Sponsor Support Agreement), whereby the Sponsor Parties have agreed, among other things, to vote in favor of the Business Combination with Tigo Energy and certain other proposals being presented at the special meeting of the Company’s stockholders.
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Sponsors (as defined in the Sale and Purchase Agreement) entered into the Sale and Purchase Agreement with Tigo Energy, pursuant to which, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, the Sponsors will sell to Tigo Energy 1,645,000 shares of Common Stock and 424,000 Private Units in exchange for an amount equal to $2,300,000 pursuant to the Sale and Purchase Agreement.
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Sponsors entered into the Note Agreement pursuant to which the Sponsors are required to repay the full amount of the expenses funded by Tigo Energy to extend the time period for the Company to consummate a Business Combination as contemplated in the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Note Agreement, the outstanding principal amount under the Note Agreement becomes immediately due and payable in full, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on the earlier of (i) on July 6, 2023, (ii) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Sale and Purchase Agreement; or (iii) the termination of the Merger Agreement.
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into a letter agreement with Tigo Energy, Roth Capital Partners, LLC (“Roth”) and Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC (“Craig-Hallum”), to terminate that certain Business Combination Marketing Agreement, dated as of August 5, 2021, by and among the Company, Roth and Craig-Hallum (the “Letter Agreement”). Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, in exchange for services rendered in connection with the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement, Roth may be issued up to 300,000 Advisor Shares (shares of common stock, post-merger) equal to a fixed amount of 100,000 shares, regardless of the amount of equity raised in exchange for services rendered in connection with the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement, plus up to 200,000 shares based on the equity raised (“Variable Compensation Shares”). The number of Variable Compensation Shares will be equal to the product of (x) the quotient of equity raised divided by $50.0 million, multiplied by (y) 200,000. The Advisor Shares are issuable based on (a) the gross proceeds received from a capital raising transaction involving the equity securities of Tigo Energy and (b) the amount remaining in the Company’s trust account after giving effect to any redemptions (as further described in the Letter Agreement). On February 23, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Letter Agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, the agreement was revised so that the term equity raised means the gross proceeds available to the post-Business Combination company immediately after the closing of the Business Combination consisting of (a) the gross proceeds received from a capital raising transaction involving the equity securities or equity-linked instruments of Tigo Energy; provided, however, that the $50.0 million of proceeds from the sale of convertible promissory notes by Tigo Energy to L1 Energy Capital Management S.a.r.l. shall be excluded from the calculation

of equity raised; (b) the gross proceeds received from a capital raising transaction involving the equity securities of the Company; and (c) the amount remaining in the Company’s trust account after giving effect to any redemptions.
See the preliminary proxy statement/prospectus included in the Registration Statement on Form S-4/A filed by us with the SEC on February 14, 2023 for additional information.
Extension and Redemptions
On December 20, 2022, we held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Extension Amendment”), giving the Company the right to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination up to five (5) times, each such extension for an additional one (1) month period, from February 10, 2023 to July 10, 2023. In connection with the stockholders’ vote at the special meeting, 9,121,751 shares of the Company’s common stock were tendered for redemption at a redemption price of approximately $10.24 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $93.4 million. After the satisfaction of such redemptions, the balance in the Trust Account was approximately $24.4 million.
On December 8 and 9, 2022, the Company entered into non-redemption agreements with certain stockholders owning, in the aggregate, 1,631,811 shares of the Company’s common stock, in which such stockholders agreed, among other things, not to redeem or exercise any right to redeem such public shares in connection with the Extension Amendment. Certain initial stockholders of the Company agreed to pay the stockholders that entered into such agreements $0.083 per share for the period from the stockholder approval of the Extension Amendment through February 10, 2023 and subsequently $0.05 per share for each one-month extension. No additional funds were deposited into the Trust Account.
Business Strategy
Our management team’s objective is to generate attractive returns and create value for our stockholders by applying a disciplined strategy of identifying attractive investment opportunities that could benefit from the addition of capital, management expertise and strategic insight.
We will leverage our management team’s broad network of proprietary and public transaction sources to find an opportunity where their expertise could effect a positive transformation of the existing business to improve the overall value proposition while maximizing shareholder value.
Our management team believes it can identify companies that are under-performing their potential due to a temporary period of dislocation in the markets in which they operate, inefficient capital allocations, over-levered capital structures, excessive cost structures, incomplete management teams and/or inappropriate business strategies. In order to increase shareholder value, we will seek to identify these dislocations and implement a proven course correction plan where management agreements are put in place, debt and equity structures are realigned and costs are reduced.
We intend to source initial business combination opportunities through the extensive networks of our management team and their affiliates. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships, including seasoned executives and operators, private equity investors, lenders, attorneys and family offices, that we believe will provide our management team with a robust flow of acquisition opportunities.
We believe successful special purpose acquisition companies require a differentiated story to make a business combination attractive for potential sellers of businesses who become partners in a public markets context. We believe that our team will be an attractive partner given our proven track record of both operational and financial success in small and medium sized public companies and our deep understanding of how to navigate complicated shareholder and capital markets dynamics in a small and mid-cap context.
Our Business Combination Process
In evaluating prospective business combinations, we expect to conduct a due diligence review process that will encompass, among other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their advisors (if applicable), on-site inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews and other reviews as we deem appropriate.

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with Roth or Craig-Hallum, our initial stockholders, officers or directors or their respective affiliates. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our initial stockholders, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or appraisal firm that regularly provides fairness opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view.
Roth and Craig-Hallum and each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which might be suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present the opportunity to such entity, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. 
We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of Roth and Craig-Hallum and our officers or directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. We may, at our option, pursue an acquisition opportunity with an entity to which Roth or Craig-Hallum, investment funds advised by Roth or Craig-Hallum, or an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the initial business combination by making a specified future issuance to any such entity. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. The determination of whether an opportunity has been expressly offered to a director of officer solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company will made based on express statements by the person offering the opportunity, and if a director or officer is unsure of whether an opportunity was offered in such capacity, he or she shall seek guidance on such determination from the audit committee of our Board of Directors.
We will have until 18 months from the consummation of our initial public offering (or by July 10, 2023, if we extend the time to complete a business combination), to consummate our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem or purchase 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders.
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
Effecting a Business Combination
General
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until the completion of our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private units, our shares, new debt, or a combination of these, as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that has begun operations but is not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales), which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
If our initial business combination is paid for using shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

4



We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or Nasdaq, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 
Sources of Target Businesses
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity groups, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources also may introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus of our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee may be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. Although some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the acquired business following our initial business combination, the presence or absence of any such arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our initial stockholders, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with such a company, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an initial business combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view.
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
Subject to our management team’s fiduciary obligations and the requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. In any case, we will only consummate an initial business combination in which we become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes as discussed below) or are otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act or to the extent permitted by law we may acquire interests in a variable interest entity, in which we may have less than a majority of the voting rights in such entity, but in which we are the primary beneficiary. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that has begun operations but is not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales), we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us.

5



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. We will not pay any finders or consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.
Fair Market Value of Target Business or Businesses
The target business or businesses or assets with which we effect our initial business combination must have a collective fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. If we acquire less than 100% of one or more target businesses in our initial business combination, the aggregate fair market value of the portion or portions we acquire must equal at least 80% of the value of the trust account at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. However, we will always acquire at least a controlling interest in a target business. The fair market value of a portion of a target business or assets will likely be calculated by multiplying the fair market value of the entire business by the percentage of the target we acquire. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with an initial target business or businesses with a collective fair market value in excess of the balance in the trust account. If we are no longer listed on a national exchange, we will not be required to satisfy the 80% test.
The fair market value of a target business or businesses or assets will be determined by our Board of Directors based upon standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as actual and potential gross margins, the values of comparable businesses, earnings and cash flow, book value, enterprise value and, where appropriate, upon the advice of appraisers or other professional consultants. Investors will be relying on the business judgment of our Board of Directors, which will have significant discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of a particular target business. If our Board of Directors is not able to independently determine that the target business or assets has a sufficient fair market value to meet the threshold criterion, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire with respect to the satisfaction of such criterion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless we consummate a business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire, that the price we are paying is fair to our stockholders.
Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. The future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. Consequently, members of our management team may not become a part of the target’s management team, and the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Further, it is also not certain whether one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination. Moreover, members of our management team may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. Our key personnel may not remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.

6



Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination
In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of how or whether they vote on the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial stockholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any founder shares, shares underlying the private units and any public shares purchased in or after our initial public offering held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we so choose and are legally permitted to do so, we have the flexibility to avoid a stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender any or all of his, her or its public shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. Whether we seek stockholder approval or engage in a tender offering, we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
If we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, it may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering (or until July 10, 2023, if we extend the time to complete a business combination) in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.
Our initial stockholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.
If we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination or that they wish to convert their shares, our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote and reduce the number of conversions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial stockholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.
Conversion/Tender Rights
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of how or whether they vote on the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial stockholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any founder shares, shares underlying the private units and any public shares purchased in or after our initial public offering held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we hold a meeting to approve an initial business combination, a holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his, her or its shares.

7



Alternatively, if we engage in a tender offer, each public stockholder will be provided the opportunity to sell his, her or its public shares to us in such tender offer. The tender offer rules require us to hold the tender offer open for at least 20 business days. Accordingly, this is the minimum amount of time we would need to provide holders to determine whether they want to sell their public shares to us in the tender offer or remain an investor in our company.
Our initial stockholders, officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly.
We may also require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, at any time at or prior to the vote on the business combination. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to stockholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver his, her or its shares if he, she or it wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under our bylaws, we are required to provide at least 10 days’ advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a stockholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. As a result, if we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing delivery requirements, holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly, investors may not be able to exercise their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise would not want to. The conversion rights will likely include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares.
There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee, and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
Any request to convert or tender such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of public shares delivered his, her or its certificate in connection with an election of their conversion or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights, he, she or it may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion or tender rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
Liquidation of Trust Account if No Business Combination
If we do not complete a business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering (or by July 10, 2023, if we extend the time to complete a business combination), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board of Directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any redemptions

are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a redemption is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. It is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 18th month from the closing of our initial public offering and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the above procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to seeking to complete an initial business combination, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
We will seek to have all third parties and any prospective target businesses enter into valid and enforceable agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. In the event that a potential contracted party was to refuse to execute such a waiver, we will execute an agreement with that entity only if our management first determines that we would be unable to obtain, on a reasonable basis, substantially similar services or opportunities from another entity willing to execute such a waiver. Examples of instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver would be the engagement of a third party consultant who cannot sign such an agreement due to regulatory restrictions, such as our auditors who are unable to sign due to independence requirements, or whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver, or a situation in which management does not believe it would be able to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. There is also no guarantee that, even if third parties execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Certain of our initial stockholders have agreed that they will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.15 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our initial stockholders will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our initial stockholders have sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations. We have not asked our initial stockholders to reserve for such obligations. We therefore cannot assure you that they will be able to satisfy their indemnification obligations if they are required to do so.
If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination and are forced to redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate the redemption of our public shares. Our insiders have waived their rights to participate in any redemption with respect to any shares owned by them. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from interest accrued in the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, our insiders have agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. Each holder of public shares will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.

Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete our initial business combination in the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us convert their respective shares of common stock upon a business combination which is actually completed by us. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per share redemption or conversion amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.15.
If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our Board of Directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these reasons.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Employees
We currently have seven executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
