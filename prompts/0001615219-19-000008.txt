Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a biotechnology company that was previously focused on developing innovative and proprietary treatments for muscle cramps, spasms and spasticity associated with severe neurological conditions. In June 2018, we announced that we were ending our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials of our lead drug product candidate, FLX-787, in patients with motor neuron disease, or MND, primarily with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or CMT, due to oral tolerability concerns observed in both studies. The wind-down of the activities associated with these studies was completed in the third quarter of 2018.
In 2016, we launched our consumer product, HOTSHOT®, to prevent and treat exercise-associated muscle cramps, or EAMCs. We continue to market and sell HOTSHOT to endurance athletes who drink it before, during and after exercise to prevent and treat exercise associated muscle cramps, or EAMCs.
In June 2018, we initiated a process to explore a range of strategic alternatives for enhancing stockholder value, including the potential sale or merger of the company. Wedbush PacGrow was engaged to act as our strategic financial advisor at that time. We also announced the restructuring of the organization to reduce our cost structure. In connection with the restructuring plan, we reduced our workforce by approximately 60%, with the reduction completed as of September 30, 2018.
Following an extensive process of evaluating strategic alternatives and identifying and reviewing potential candidates for a strategic acquisition or other transaction, on January 3, 2019, we entered into a merger agreement with Salarius Pharmaceuticals, LLC, or Salarius, under which the privately held Salarius will merge with a wholly owned subsidiary of Flex Pharma. If the merger is completed, the business of Salarius will continue as the business of the combined organization.
We expect to devote significant time and resources to completion of this merger. However, there can be no assurance that such activities will result in the completion of the merger. Further, the completion of the merger may ultimately not deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance shareholder value.
If the merger is not completed, we will reconsider our strategic alternatives. In this case, we consider one of the following courses of action to be the most likely alternatives:

• | Dissolve and liquidate our assets. If, for any reason, the merger does not close, our Board of Directors will most likely conclude that it is in the best interest of stockholders to dissolve the Company and liquidate our assets. In that event, we would be required to pay all of our debts and contractual obligations, and to set aside certain reserves for potential future claims. There would be no assurances as to the amount or timing of available cash remaining to distribute to stockholders after paying our obligations and setting aside funds for reserves. 


• | Pursue another strategic transaction. We may resume the process of evaluating a potential strategic transaction in order to attempt another strategic transaction like the merger. 


• | Operate the consumer business. Although less likely than the alternatives above, our Board of Directors may elect to continue to market and sell HOTSHOT and continue to operate our consumer business. 

We cannot predict whether or to what extent we might resume previous level of research and development activities, including clinical trials, or what the related future cash needs would be for any such activities.
Historical Business and Programs
We focused our historical efforts on developing innovative and proprietary treatments for muscle cramps, spasms and spasticity associated with severe neurological conditions and exercise-associated muscle cramps. 
Muscle cramps and spasms are involuntary, often painful, contractions that can last several minutes and, in many instances, result in prolonged soreness. Muscle cramps and spasms are thought to result from hyperexcitable alpha-motor neurons. Spasticity is characterized by the combination of weakness and velocity-dependent resistance to stretch, in the same muscle. This reflex hyperexcitability may be due to lost inhibition in spinal cord circuits. FLX-787, HOTSHOT and our other drug product candidates are based on a mechanism of action we describe as chemical neurostimulation. We believe chemical neurostimulation to be a process in which a molecule, 
1

such as FLX-787, acts topically on the surfaces of the mouth, throat, esophagus and stomach to produce a sensory signal by activating nerves in those tissues. That signal is thought to ultimately result in a beneficial effect. Specifically, our product candidates activate certain receptors known as transient receptor potential, or TRP, ion channels in primary sensory neurons producing a signal believed to inhibit neuronal circuits and thereby reduce hyperexcitability in the neurons that fire muscles. Reduced alpha-motor neuron hyperexcitability in spinal cord circuits is thought to suppress repetitive firing of alpha-motor neurons, thereby preventing or reducing muscle cramps and spasms, and potentially reducing reflex hyperexcitability and therefore spasticity.
At the time we decided to stop our two Phase 2 clinical trials in June 2018, we were developing FLX-787 for severe neurological conditions. We had recently completed a Phase 2 exploratory clinical trial in patients with Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, and were executing two Phase 2 clinical trials, one in MND and one in CMT.
One Phase 2 clinical trial in the United States, referred to as the COMMEND trial, was in patients with MND, primarily with ALS, who suffered from muscle cramps. FLX-787 was being developed for ALS under fast track designation which was granted by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in July 2017. The other Phase 2 clinical trial in the United States, referred to as the COMMIT trial, was in patients with CMT who suffered from muscle cramps. We stopped these studies due to oral tolerability concerns observed in both studies. In the COMMEND study, 31% of patients randomized to receive the oral disintegrating tablet, or ODT, formulation at 30 mg, taken three times a day, discontinued before the end of the 4-week treatment period due to oral adverse events. A similar proportion of subjects in the COMMIT study discontinued due to oral adverse events, after being randomized to the 30 mg dose. No patients randomized to the 0.5 mg low-dose control discontinued due to oral adverse events in either study. The wind-down of the activities associated with these studies was completed in the third quarter of 2018.
In addition to developing FLX-787, we also developed and launched our HOTSHOT consumer beverage in 2016. HOTSHOT is our consumer beverage containing a proprietary formulation of TRP activators. The majority of HOTSHOT sales are generated through our branded website and third-party websites. We also sell HOTSHOT to select specialty retailers in geographic areas with strong endurance sports markets and directly to athletic teams at the amateur and professional levels.
On January 22, 2018, we disclosed that we engaged an investment banking firm to assist with the consideration of strategic alternatives for our consumer business segment. In connection with the restructuring plan announced in June 2018, we elected to reduce the expenses associated with our consumer business segment while we assessed strategic alternatives for the Company and this segment.
Our Scientific Approach
Research has shown that muscle cramping is caused by the uncontrolled and repetitive firing of alpha-motor neurons that control muscle contraction, which results in maintained contraction of the muscle. We believe that by inhibiting this firing of the alpha-motor neurons that control muscle contraction, muscle cramping can be reduced or prevented.
Motor neurons respond to inputs from complex circuits in the spinal cord that both reduce neuronal and muscle activity, known as “inhibitory” input, and increase neuronal and muscle activity, known as "excitatory" input. Our approach exploits a general principle of neural circuits: that strong excitatory input from one source in the body enhances overall inhibitory tone in the spinal cord and thereby reduces neuronal response to other excitatory input.
The activation of a particular set of ion channels, and the resulting effect on the inhibitory/excitatory balance in the system, forms the basis of our scientific approach. Our scientific co-founder, Roderick MacKinnon, M.D., is a world leader in this field. Dr. MacKinnon was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2003 for his work determining the structure and function of potassium channels, and in particular showing the mechanism by which channels select for particular ions (Doyle, et al., The Structure of the Potassium Channel: Molecular Basis of K+ Conduction and Selectivity, April 1998, Science). The TRP vanilloid-1, or TRPV1, receptor is important to diverse physiological functions. The TRPV1 ion channel acts as a sensor that reacts to multiple sensory inputs including: heat, low pH and a variety of pungent chemical agents. The TRP subfamily A, member 1, or TRPA1, ion channel is a channel in the cell membrane that can be activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including cold temperature and pungent chemical agents. TRPA1 and TRPV1 ion channels are expressed in primary sensory neurons and carry signals directly to the spinal cord.
We refer to the mechanism of action of our product candidates as chemical neurostimulation. We believe chemical neurostimulation to be a process in which a molecule, such as FLX-787, acts topically on the surfaces of the mouth, throat, esophagus and stomach to produce a sensory signal by activating nerves in those tissues. That signal is thought to ultimately result in a beneficial effect, through the activation of TRPV1 and TRPA1 ion channels. These 
2

sensory neurons project to the spinal cord, and we believe that their activation enhances the overall inhibitory tone in spinal cord circuits, which reduces repetitive firing of the alpha-motor neurons and thereby prevents or reduces the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps and spasms, and potentially reduces reflex hyperexcitability and therefore spasticity. Muscle cramps and spasms are thought to result from hyperexcitable alpha-motor neurons, and spasticity is thought to result from reflex hyperexcitability.
We believe the biologically active components of HOTSHOT and FLX-787 activate specific TRP ion channel receptors found on the surface of the mouth, throat, esophagus and stomach, triggering signals in sensory neurons that are relayed to the spinal cord. This sensory signaling, once processed, is thought to increase inhibition in spinal cord circuits, reducing alpha-motor neuron hyperexcitability, preventing muscle cramps and spasms, and potentially reducing reflex hyperexcitability and therefore spasticity.
FLX-787 
FLX-787 is a single molecule, chemically synthesized, dual TRP V1/A1 ion channel activator. We originally tested FLX-787 using our electrically-induced human cramp model and we later tested FLX-787 in nocturnal leg cramps. Following the testing of FLX-787 in nocturnal leg cramps, we decided to focus our FLX-787 development efforts on muscle cramps, spasms and spasticity related to severe neurological conditions, including MS, ALS and CMT. 
Clinical Trials of FLX-787 in Patients with Severe Neurological Conditions
The FDA has never approved a drug to treat cramping in a neurological condition and our past trials were designed to evaluate a number of different endpoints. We conducted exploratory Phase 2 clinical trials in Australia in MS and ALS that were designed as trials to determine the effect of FLX-787 across a broad range of potential endpoints with no pre-specified primary endpoint. Prior to their stoppage, our Phase 2 clinical trials in the United States in patients with MND and CMT were designed to measure changes in cramp frequency as the primary endpoint along with several secondary endpoints. Change in cramp frequency was chosen as the primary endpoint based, in part, upon feedback we received from the FDA for a proposed trial in patients with nocturnal leg cramps. 
Multiple Sclerosis
Background. MS is an autoimmune disease in which inflammatory processes cause worsening demyelination and cell degeneration over years, resulting in a variety of neurological deficits such as loss of muscle control, sensation and vision. Spasticity is common in MS and is characterized by the combination of weakness and velocity-dependent resistance to stretch, in the same muscle. This reflex hyperexcitability may be due to lost inhibition in the spinal cord circuits, as descending pathways demyelinate. The need to treat spasticity increases as the disease progresses and goes hand in hand with worsening muscle weakness, leading to complications such as contractures, bed sores and severe pain. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, between 250,000 and 350,000 people in the United States suffer from MS and approximately 84% of patients with MS experience spasticity. We believe that a significant number of MS patients also experience muscle cramps and/or spasms. 
MS Clinical Trial. In March 2018, we announced topline data from our exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial of FLEX-787 in MS patients with frequent muscle cramps/spasms and spasticity. FLX-787 at a dose of 19 mg, taken orally twice daily, in a liquid formulation, was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross over trial in 57 MS patients. In the evaluation of FLX-787 for its impact on MS patients' cramps/spasms and spasticity, pre-specified analyses of the parallel portion of the study showed a statistically significant 27.3% reduction in the frequency of cramps/spasms compared to with control (p=0.001); a 1.4 day increase in cramp/spasm-free days per 14 day period compared with control (p=0.046); clinician rated improvement in spasticity with FLX-787 treatment significantly better than control (p=0.010); and treating physicians reported that 7 of 28 (25%) patients on FLX-787 had "Much Improved" or "Very Much Improved" spasticity versus 0 of 26 (0%) on control based on the Clinical Global Impression of Change in Spasticity. 
In addition, in the evaluation of FLX-787 from data that included both cross-over periods in the intent-to-treat population, the pre-specified analysis of Clinical Global Impression of Change in the patient's spasticity showed statistically significant greater improvement with FLX-787 relative to control (p=0.043), while no statistically significant improvement was seen in cramp/spasm frequency, NRS or clinical spasticity scales. 
Motor Neuron Disease and ALS 
Background. Motor neuron disease is a progressive disease that leads to motor neuron degeneration, dysfunction and eventual neuronal death in the brain and spinal cord. Motor neuron disease includes diseases such as ALS, 
3

primary lateral sclerosis, and progressive muscular atrophy and related disorders that affect the upper and lower motor neurons. Motor neuron degeneration leads to progressive loss of voluntary motor control and is often associated with muscle cramps, spasms and spasticity resulting in increased pain, reduced function and decreased quality of life. ALS is a neurological disease that affects approximately 20,000 people in the United States and causes muscle weakness and impacts physical function. ALS often begins with muscle twitching and weakness in an arm or leg, or sometimes with slurring of speech. Eventually, ALS can affect the ability to control the muscles needed to move, speak, eat and breathe. ALS patients commonly experience fasciculations, which are persistent muscle twitches that can interfere with sleep, and many patients with ALS experience painful muscle cramps. 
Motor Neuron Disease and ALS Clinical Trial. In August 2017, we announced the initiation of the COMMEND trial, a Phase 2 clinical trial in the United States. The COMMEND trial was designed to evaluate FLX-787 in patients with MND, focused on ALS, who suffer from cramps. This randomized, controlled, double-blinded, parallel design trial included a 28-day run-in period to establish a baseline in cramp frequency. Patients were then randomized to treatment with 30 mg of FLX-787, formulated as an ODT, administered three times a day, or to a control, for 28 days. We stopped this trial in June 2018 due to oral tolerability issues observed in this study and the COMMIT trial.
Charcot-Marie-Tooth 
Background. CMT is the most common form of inherited neuromuscular disease, affecting an estimated 150,000 people in the United States. It occurs in populations worldwide with a prevalence of about 1 in 2,500 individuals. The primary clinical features of this disease are slowly progressive distal weakness, muscle atrophy affecting the feet and legs and sensory loss. The presence of muscle cramps in hands, fingers and other muscles commonly experienced by CMT patients is a result of peripheral degeneration which disturbs sensory motor integration in the spinal cord which can lead to hyperexcitability and muscle cramps. Patients with CMT usually do not suffer from spasticity or other central nervous system symptoms, as the underlying pathology affects the peripheral nerve. A large majority of CMT patients experience muscle cramps frequently, in many muscles, which can interfere with motor performance, exercise, activities of daily living, sleep and quality of life.
CMT Clinical Trial. In October 2017, we announced the initiation of the COMMIT trial, a Phase 2 clinical trial in the United States in patients that suffer from cramps associated with CMT. The COMMIT trial was a randomized, controlled, double-blinded, parallel design trial included a run-in period to establish a baseline in cramp frequency. Patients then were randomized to 30 mg of FLX-787, formulated as an ODT, administered three times a day or to a control, for 28 days. We stopped this trial in June 2018 due to oral tolerability issues observed in this study and the COMMEND trial.
HOTSHOT 
In June 2016, we launched our consumer product, HOTSHOT, which is currently our only source of revenue. HOTSHOT’s efficacy is based on the same potential mechanism of action of chemical neurostimulation as our drug product candidates but is formulated as a consumer beverage with a lower amount of TRP activators. We have primarily marketed HOTSHOT to endurance athletes who drink it before, during and after exercise to prevent and treat EAMCs.  
On January 22, 2018, we disclosed that we hired an investment banking firm to help us explore strategic alternatives for our consumer business segment. In connection with the restructuring plan announced in June 2018, we elected to reduce the expenses associated with our consumer business segment while we assessed strategic alternatives for the Company and this segment.
Exercise-Associated Muscle Cramps (EAMC)
Background. EAMCs are painful, involuntary contractions of a skeletal muscle that occur during or following exercise in individuals and result in acute pain, stiffness, bulging or knotting of the muscle and soreness that can last for several days. EAMCs can be experienced by individuals participating in any sport, but EAMCs are particularly prevalent in athletes engaged in high-intensity endurance activities, such as triathlons, marathons and cycling events. 
Limitations of Current Products. There are a number of well-known sports drinks and other consumer products that are intended to treat electrolyte abnormalities and dehydration. However, we do not believe clinical studies have proven that these factors, in isolation, cause EAMCs. Scientists recently began hypothesizing that altered neuromuscular control, as a result of muscle fatigue, causes EAMCs. While there are other companies that market their muscle cramping products to endurance athletes participating in high-intensity sports, we believe HOTSHOT is the only product that has been shown to be scientifically effective in treating muscle cramps.

HOTSHOT for the Prevention and Treatment of Exercise-Associated Muscle Cramps
HOTSHOT is a beverage that athletes take before, during and after exercise to prevent and treat muscle cramps. It is based on our founders’ original extract formulation of TRP activators. We tested several different formulations of the active ingredients from this extract formulation to refine the taste while ensuring continued efficacy in treating and preventing muscle cramps. We also added emulsifiers and flavoring agents, to develop a more appealing consumer product. HOTSHOT includes organic ingredients and is priced at a premium to many existing sports beverages. 
HOTSHOT for Relief from Muscle Soreness and Muscle Pain
In addition to helping to prevent and treat muscle cramps, HOTSHOT has also shown potential benefits for relief from muscle soreness and muscle pain.
Post exercise muscle soreness or muscle pain, sometimes referred to as delayed onset muscle soreness, is believed to be a result of microscopic damage to muscle fibers involved with exercise and the resulting inflammation and swelling. Potential remedies to reduce muscle soreness and muscle pain vary from stretching the sore muscles, to ice pack application, massage, acupressure and oral pain relief agents. 
In 2017, we completed an in-home use study in which the vast majority of endurance and non-endurance athletes surveyed reported that HOTSHOT reduced muscle soreness and muscle pain when used before or after a workout. 
HOTSHOT Brand Strategy
HOTSHOT has historically been marketed primarily to endurance athletes that participate in high endurance sports, such as triathlons, marathons and cycling events and suffer from muscle cramps. In early 2018, we began expanding our sales and marketing efforts to also promote HOTSHOT's ability to provide relief from muscle pain and muscle soreness in endurance and non-endurance athletes. However, in connection with the restructuring activities in June 2018, we reduced our expenses associated with the consumer business segment which has limited our marketing and promotion of HOTSHOT's benefits. 
We historically increased awareness and demand for HOTSHOT through the use of targeted digital, print and social media campaigns, sales and marketing campaigns focused on key geographic areas, including product sampling, and public relations activities. To explain the science behind HOTSHOT, we highlight the importance of an athlete’s nerves and muscles working together to prevent and treat muscle cramps. Our current efforts to promote HOTSHOT are primarily focused on email campaigns, social media promotion and product sampling.
HOTSHOT Distribution 
We use e-commerce strategies to sell online through our direct-to-consumer website and through third-party websites, including a retailer that offers international shipping. The majority of our sales and marketing efforts have been focused on geographic areas with strong endurance sports markets, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boulder, Boston, Chicago and New York. In each of these locations, we built brand awareness by attending endurance sports events and distributing HOTSHOT to leading specialty retailers, such as cycling, running and triathlon stores. 
Intellectual Property
The goal of our intellectual property efforts is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries.
Patents and Patent Applications
Our intellectual property approach has been to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our drug product candidates and consumer products, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. For more information regarding risks related to patents and other intellectual property, see "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property."
We own a first family of applications, including an issued U.S. utility patent application and one granted European patent directed to compositions and methods of using those compositions for preventing, treating or ameliorating 
5

muscle cramping. The issued U.S. patent is scheduled to expire in July 2031 and the granted patent in Europe will have a statutory expiration in July 2031. 
We also own additional patent applications directed at various aspects of our prior work including influencing neuromuscular activity by stimulating a TRP channel in the nerve ending of a sensory neuron. In connection with the restructuring actions taken in June 2018, we decided to no longer support these applications.
We also own one design patent application directed to one of our HOTSHOT bottles. The international design patent application was granted in September 2016. The current status of the designations are Australia (granted), Canada (pending), Europe (pending), South Africa (granted), and the United States (granted). The statutory expiration of the design patents will vary based on jurisdiction. The United States design patent will expire in October 2033, subject to the payment of maintenance fees. 
While we seek broad coverage for our patents, there is always a risk that an alteration to the composition of matter or formulation of our consumer products may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringement claims by us.
Trade Secrets, Trademarks and Proprietary Information
Our drug product candidates and consumer product have gone through numerous iterations to optimize their effectiveness, thereby creating trade secrets and proprietary know-how. In particular, the formulation of our consumer product is treated as a trade secret. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees to execute Proprietary Information, Inventions, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Competition Agreements upon the commencement of their employment. Consultants and other advisors are required to sign consulting agreements. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third-parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, and utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during their employment with us, shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from entities that receive our confidential data or materials.
We have received trademark protection from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, and several foreign bodies for certain of our marks and will continue to apply for trademark protection with the USPTO and applicable foreign bodies for our brand. Issuance of a federally registered trademark creates a rebuttable presumption of ownership of the mark, but may be subject to challenge by others claiming first use in the mark in some or all of the areas in which it is used. Federally registered trademarks have a perpetual life, as long as they are maintained and renewed on a timely basis and used properly as trademarks, subject to the rights of third-parties to seek cancellation of the trademarks if they claim priority or confusion of usage. We believe that trademarks are an important element of our ability to successfully market our consumer product.
Our wholly owned subsidiary that holds our consumer business, Flex Innovation Group LLC, or Flex Innovation, owns all U.S. trademark applications and registrations for marks used (or intended to be used) by us, including the HOTSHOT trademark. Outside the U.S., ownership of the HOTSHOT trademark is split between Flex Innovation and the Company.  Flex Innovation owns an International Registration for the HOTSHOT trademark and applications or registrations for the HOTSHOT trademark in Australia, China, the European Union, Iran, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, the Russian Federation, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Ukraine, and Vietnam.  The Company owns applications or registrations for the HOTSHOT trademark in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Malaysia, Peru, Qatar, South Africa, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates.
Royalty Agreement
In connection with the transfer of certain intellectual property to us by certain of our founders, or collectively the Founders, on March 20, 2014, we entered into a royalty agreement with the Founders. Pursuant to the royalty agreement, the Company is obligated to pay the Founders a royalty of 2%, in the aggregate, of gross sales of any product sold by us or by any of our licensees for use in the treatment of any neuromuscular disorders, and that uses, incorporates or embodies, or made using any of our intellectual property, including any know-how. The royalty agreement grants the Founders certain audit rights and requires any license or sublicense granted by us be consistent with the terms and conditions of the royalty agreement. Each Founder may assign his rights and obligations under the royalty agreement to a third party upon prior written notice to us and we may not assign our rights and obligations thereunder except in the event of a change in control relating to our company. The term of the royalty agreement is perpetual. 
6

In January 2019, the Founders entered into a royalty agreement with Flex Innovation, which replaces the royalty agreement described above related to the sale of over the counter, non-prescription and/or nutritional supplement products. Under the terms of the agreement, Flex Innovation is now the party obligated to pay the Founders a royalty on all over the counter, non-prescription and/or nutritional supplement products sold by Flex Innovation that are marketed to stop, prevent, relieve or otherwise treat muscle cramps, muscle soreness, or aid in muscle recovery. The product must also include at least one ion channel activator, as defined in the agreement. The royalty is payable on sales, as defined, over twenty years with a 2% royalty for the first ten years and a 1% royalty for the next ten years.
Manufacturing
We do not currently have our own manufacturing facilities and we do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. We rely on a network of third-party manufacturers to supply materials and produce HOTSHOT. Several contract suppliers provide us with raw materials and our co-packer converts these raw materials into finished goods available for sale. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a sole source third-party co-packer to produce, bottle and package HOTSHOT and have entered into a production agreement with this co-packer. We rely on a third party as the sole source for certain of the raw materials in HOTSHOT and have entered into a supply agreement with this supplier. There can be no assurance that our sole source third-party manufacturer and suppliers will meet our commercial demands in a timely manner or that we will be able to identify and establish relationships with qualified additional or back-up suppliers and manufacturers. 
Sales and Marketing
HOTSHOT
We launched HOTSHOT in June 2016 and our marketing efforts have focused on building brand awareness and usage of HOTSHOT. To drive product trial, we have used a variety of sales and marketing strategies, including sponsorships of endurance events, endorsements from endurance athletes, public relations campaigns, print and digital media campaigns, social media advertisements, product sampling and promotional activities at events such as marathons, triathlons, cycling events and obstacle course races. Our current efforts to promote HOTSHOT are primarily focused on email campaigns, social media promotion and product sampling.
We use e-commerce strategies to sell online through our direct-to-consumer website and through third-party websites, including a retailer that offers international shipping. We have targeted select geographic areas with strong endurance sports markets, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boulder, Boston, Chicago and New York. We focused our sales efforts on these locations to accelerate distribution of our product initially through specialty retailers, such as cycling, running and triathlon stores. 
Competition
HOTSHOT competes against traditional beverage companies, sports beverage companies and companies developing dietary supplements. We believe the principal elements of competition in the consumer product industry are price, taste, selection, brand recognition, brand loyalty, distribution channel offerings, the effectiveness of the product and discretionary income available to consumers.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing or may develop. Any drug candidate that we may develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the corresponding foreign regulatory agencies before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Conventional foods, while generally not subject to premarket review, still must comply with numerous manufacturing, labeling and other regulations.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or 
7

after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA's refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, or other applicable regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an IRB at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA's laws and regulations pertaining to the conduct of human clinical studies, collectively referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, and according to the International Council for Harmonization, or ICH, GCP guidelines, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;


• | submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, for a proposed new drug;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA's requirements for current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity;


• | potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.

The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain.
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the non-clinical testing stage, also referred to as pre-clinical testing. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. The IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to healthy subjects or patients with the target disease under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor's control. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA's regulations which reflect the ICH GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. 
8

Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted only in patients having the specific disease. 


• | Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse events and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule for patients having the specific disease. 


• | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Generally, at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. In some cases, the FDA has approved a drug based on the results of a single adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 study of excellent design and which provided highly reliable and statistically strong evidence of important clinical benefit, such as an effect on survival, and a confirmatory study would have been difficult to conduct on ethical grounds. 

Post-approval studies, also referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as part of the approval process.
Progress reports detailing the status of drug development and results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects or patients. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to study subjects.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
FDA Review and Approval Processes
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent pre-clinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has 12 months after submission of an NDA in which to complete its initial review of a standard 
9

new molecular entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and eight months for a priority review NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for review of standard and priority review NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by additional three-month review periods whenever the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission at any time during the review cycle.
The FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the drug approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is to be manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA regulations regarding conduct of clinical trials for the product's trials. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information.
The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA will issue a "complete response" letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post approval studies, referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a product's safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any drug products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. These promotion and advertising requirements include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions against promoting drugs for uses or in-patient populations that are not described in the drug's approved labeling (known as "off-label use"), rules for conducting industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
We have relied and may continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and future commercial quantities of our products. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA's cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality 
10

control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are also required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA. These restrictions may include suspension of a product until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, continuing oversight of manufacturing by the FDA under a consent decree of permanent injunction, which frequently includes the imposition of costs and continuing inspections over a period of many years, as well as possible withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Conventional Food Regulation
HOTSHOT is regulated as a conventional food. Food products are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and abroad with respect to their safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution. The manufacture, packaging, labeling, holding, sale, and distribution of foods are also subject to extensive local, state, and foreign government regulation. The Bureau of Customs and Border Patrol, or CBP, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, also regulates shipments containing conventional foods and engages in enforcement activity in concert with the FDA to block the import or export of articles deemed adulterated or otherwise unlawful for sale in the United States (imports) or in the non-U.S. country to which articles are addressed. Import holds on articles or demands for recall can interfere with the timely delivery of products to market and can result in regulatory fines and penalties.
The FDCA requires that substances added to food must either be approved food additives or must be generally recognized as safe, or GRAS, for their intended use. GRAS status can be documented through several means: an applicable FDA regulation, a notification that is submitted to FDA and to which the agency responds that it has no questions, or through a “self-determination” based on the views of scientific experts that is not submitted to the agency. For ingredients that are the subject of a GRAS “self-determination,” either by us or by our suppliers, there can be no assurance that FDA will agree with the GRAS assessment. Moreover, the agency can and has revised the status of GRAS ingredients, as it did in June 2015 when FDA revoked the GRAS status of partially hydrogenated oils. 
The FDA, a state Attorney General, or others could object to the positioning of our consumer product as a conventional food rather than a dietary supplement. The FDA issued a guidance document in 2014 objecting to the marketing of dietary supplements in the form of conventional beverages. The guidance explains that FDA will consider such factors as the labeling and advertising, product name, product packaging, serving size and recommended daily intake, recommendations and directions for use, marketing practices, and composition when determining whether a product is lawfully marketed as a conventional food. We believe we have designed each of these elements in a way that is appropriate for a conventional food, but cannot rule out the possibility that the FDA or another party could take the position that the product must be regulated as a dietary supplement, requiring changes to the label and potentially to the formulation.
The FDA generally prohibits labeling a food with any "health claim" (i.e., any statement associating a nutrient with risk-reduction, but not treatment, of a disease or health-related condition), unless the claim is pre-approved by the FDA. The FDA prohibits entirely disease diagnosis, prevention and treatment claims when made for a food. Additionally, nutrient content claims, or claims that implicitly or expressly characterize the levels of a nutrient found in a food, may only be made in accordance with FDA regulations. However, other claims, including so-called "structure/function claims," are permitted to be included in labeling for foods without FDA pre-approval. Such statements may describe how a food affects the structure, function or general well-being of the body, or the mechanism of action by which a food may affect the structure, function or well-being of the body, but such statements may not state that a food will reduce the risk or incidence of a disease unless such claim has been reviewed and approved by the FDA as a health claim. Structure/function claims used in labeling must be supported by evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. There can be no assurance, however, that the FDA will not determine that a particular structure/function claim that we want to use is an unacceptable disease claim or an unauthorized nutrient-disease relationship claim otherwise permitted with FDA approval as a "health claim." Such a determination might prevent the use of such a claim.
11

The regulation of foods may increase or become more restrictive in the future. There can be no assurance that, if more stringent statutes are enacted for foods, or if more stringent regulations are promulgated, we will be able to comply with such statutes or regulations without incurring substantial expense.
The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the FDCA concerning all of the products it regulates, including powers to issue a public "warning letter" to a company, to quarantine and prohibit the sale of products deemed adulterated or misbranded, to publicize information about illegal products, to request a voluntary recall of illegal products from the market, to request that the Department of Justice initiate a seizure action, an injunction action or a criminal prosecution in U.S. courts, and to seek disgorgement from a federal court of all proceeds received from the sale of products deemed misbranded or adulterated.
The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, enforces the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTCA, and related regulations, which govern the advertising associated with the promotion and sale of dietary supplements to prevent misleading or deceptive claims.
In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against food and dietary supplement companies for making false or misleading advertising claims and for failing to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising. These enforcement actions have often resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties and/or restitution by the companies involved. The FTC also regulates other aspects of consumer purchases including, but not limited to, promotional offers, telemarketing, continuity plans, and "free" offers.
We are also subject to regulation under various state, local and international laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of dietary supplements. California has a law called the "Consumers Legal Remedies Act" (Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1750 et seq) that allows private parties to assert a class action claim for false or deceptive advertising. It is typically asserted in combination with claims for false advertising and unfair competition under the California Business and Professions Code. California law firms specializing in these type of consumer class action claims target dietary supplement makers and sellers of products sold in California, claiming injury based on the products' failure to deliver results as claimed in product labeling and promotion.
The U.S. Postal Inspection Service enforces federal laws governing fraudulent use of the mail. Regulation of certain aspects of the dietary supplement business at the federal level is also governed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, (e.g., concerning the presence of adulterated substances, such as toxic levels of lead or iron, that render products unsafe for consumption and require a CPSC ordered recall), the Department of Agriculture (e.g., for products that are intended for ingestion as dietary supplements for animals) and the Environmental Protection Agency (e.g., in the methods of disposal used for certain dietary ingredients, such as colloidal silver).
Government regulations in foreign countries may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of certain of our products. We expect that compliance with such foreign governmental regulations will generally be the responsibility of our distributors, if any, in those countries and we expect these distributors will be independent contractors that we do not control.
In addition, from time to time in the future, we may become subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA, the FTC, or by other federal, state, local or foreign regulatory authorities, to the repeal of laws or regulations that we generally consider favorable, or to more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. We are not able to predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, repeals or interpretations, and we cannot predict what effect additional governmental regulation, if and when it occurs, would have on our business in the future. Such developments could, however, require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, additional personnel or other new requirements. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Europe
The European Union, or EU, is responsible for the development of legislation governing foods, nutritional supplements, and medicines sold in Europe. Member States of the EU, or Member States, are authorized to develop local legislation governing these products, provided such legislation is not more restrictive than the legislation promulgated by the EU. Member States are responsible for enforcement of the applicable legislation. In 2002, the EU established a process for Member States to bring this regulating legislation in line with a published directive of the EU, which addressed the labeling and marketing of vitamins and minerals, what nutrients are 
12

permitted or not permitted and other packaging requirements. In 2004, the EU established standards for the manufacture and marketing of herbal medicines with the Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive. This requires, among other things, manufacturers of herbal medicinal products to comply with Pharmaceutical Group Standards, and only requires proof of safety, not efficacy.
In 2006, the EU adopted its Commission Directive 2006/37/EC, amending its Directive 2002/46/EC. Under the amended directive, only nutrients listed in Annex II, or approved by subsequent order of the EU, may be lawfully sold in Member States. The EU also regulates labels, labeling, and advertising associated with the promotion and sale of dietary supplements in Europe. These regulations may make it unlawful for us to sell certain products in Europe that are lawfully labeled and sold in the United States.
In the United Kingdom, the principal governing legislation is the Food Safety Act of 1990, or FSA (governing safety of food products) and the Medicines Act of 1968 (governing licensing and sale of medicine). Further guidance is provided by numerous Statutory Instruments addressing the formulation, purity, packaging, advertising and labeling of such products. Medicinal products are regulated and enforced by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), an agency of the Department of Health. The MHRA determines if an herbal remedy is medicinal by virtue of its "presentation" or "function." Food products are regulated by the Food Standard Agency (FSA), which reports to the Department of Health and to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Vitamin and mineral supplements and soup products with herbal ingredients are generally considered food supplements and are subject to the purview of the FSA. 
Additional legislative standards have been adopted in the other EU countries, typically similar in scope to the UK. The regulatory scheme in Canada is similar but not identical to that of the United States concerning medicines and healthcare products or material health products and is regulated by Health Canada.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement for Drug Products
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any drug products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. In addition, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will continue to experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative and regulatory initiatives. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our drug products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. If these third-party payors do not consider our drug products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. For example, in the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a 
13

reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been, and continue to be, a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs.
In March 2010, then President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, a sweeping law intended to, among other things, broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the ACA revises the definition of "average manufacturer price" for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective. Further, the law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, and increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, on August 2, 2011, then President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, then President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.
Moreover, the recently enacted Drug Supply Chain Security Act, imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, which is being phased in over several years. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
Further, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, the Trump 
14

administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. Although these and other proposed measure will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities. Failure to comply with such regulations could potentially result in substantial penalties to us. Even if we structure our programs with the intent of compliance with such laws, there can be no certainty that we would not need to defend against enforcement or litigation, in light of the fact that there is significant enforcement interest in pharmaceutical companies in the United States, and some of the applicable laws are quite broad in scope.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the ACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (discussed below).
The federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, and the federal civil monetary penalties statute prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the federal civil False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. 
Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created several additional federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal laws mentioned above, and some of these state laws are broader in scope and may apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. For example, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations established uniform federal standards for certain "covered entities" (certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included expansion of HIPAA's privacy and security standards under HITECH, which became effective on February 17, 2010. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's security standards directly applicable to "business associates" — independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave 
15

state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
Several states have also enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, or register their sales representatives, as well as prohibiting pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. Additionally, in order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain.
Many of our current as well as possible future activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. We must also comply with laws that require clinical trial registration and reporting of clinical trial results on the publicly available clinical trial databank maintained by the National Institutes of Health at www.ClinicalTrials.gov. We are subject to various environmental, health and safety regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances. From time to time, and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous materials.
Because of the breadth of these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant administrative, criminal and civil penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
