Our Business Overview
 
Muscle Maker is a fast casual restaurant concept that specializes in preparing healthy-inspired, high-quality, fresh, made-to-order lean, protein-based meals featuring chicken, seafood, pasta, burgers, wraps and flat breads. In addition, we feature freshly prepared entrée salads and an appealing selection of sides, protein shakes and fruit smoothies. We operate in the fast casual restaurant segment.
 
We believe our healthier restaurant concept delivers a highly differentiated customer experience. We combine the quality and hospitality that customers commonly associate with our full service and fast casual restaurant competitors with the convenience and value customers generally expect from traditional fast food restaurants, but in a healthier way. The following core values form the foundation of our brand:
 

● | Quality. Commitment to provide high quality, healthy-inspired food for a wonderful experience. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Empowerment and Respect. We seek to empower our employees to take initiative and give their best while respecting themselves and others to maintain an environment for team work and growth. 
● | Service. Provide world class service to achieve excellence each passing day. 
● | Value. Our combination of high-quality, healthy-inspired food, empowerment of our employees, world class service, all delivered at an affordable price, strengthens the value proposition for our customers. 

 
In striving for these goals, we aspire to connect with our target market and create a great brand with a strong and loyal customer base.
 
As of December 31, 2017, Muscle Maker and its subsidiaries and franchisees operated 53 Muscle Maker Grill restaurants located in 15 states and Kuwait, 13 of which are owned and operated by Muscle Maker, and 40 are franchise restaurants. Our restaurants generated company-operated restaurant revenue of $5,215,285 and $2,735,222 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, total company revenues, which includes revenue derived from franchisees were $7,929,137 and $4,953,205, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we reported net losses of $15,567,751 and $4,219,687, respectively, and negative cash flows from operating activities of $3,676,999 and $2,110,702, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had an aggregate accumulated deficit of $17,052,086. We anticipate that we will continue to report losses and negative cash flow. As a result of the net loss and cash flow deficit for the year ended December 31, 2017 and other factors, our independent auditors issued an audit opinion with respect to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 that indicated that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
We are the owner of the trade name and service mark Muscle Maker Grill® and other trademarks and intellectual property we use in connection with the operation of Muscle Maker Grill® restaurants. We license the right to use the Muscle Maker Grill® trademarks and intellectual property to our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Muscle Maker Development and Muscle Maker Corp., and to further sublicense them to our franchisees for use in connection with Muscle Maker Grill® restaurants.
 
Seasonal factors and the timing of holidays cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our revenue per restaurant is typically lower in the fourth quarter due to reduced November and December traffic and higher traffic in the first, second, and third quarters.

Our Industry
 
We operate within the LSR (Limited Service Restaurant) segment of the U.S. restaurant industry, which includes QSR and fast-casual restaurants. We offer fast-casual quality food combined with quick-service speed, convenience and value across multiple dayparts. We believe our differentiated, high-quality healthier menu delivers great value all day, every day and positions us to compete successfully against both QSR and fast-casual concepts, providing us with a large addressable market.
 
We expect that the upward trend towards healthier eating will attract and increase consumer demand for fresh and hand-prepared dishes, leading to a positive impact on our sales.
 
Our Strategy
 
We plan to pursue the following strategies to grow our revenues and profits.
 
Expand Our System-Wide Restaurant Base. We believe we are in the early stages of our turn-around growth story with 40 current locations in 15 states and Kuwait, as of February 25, 2019.

● | Our near term strategy focuses on two areas of unit level growth – company-operated restaurants in non-traditional locations such as military bases and franchise growth by expanding in existing markets, especially in the Northeast region of the United States. We believe this market provides an attractive opportunity to leverage our brand awareness and infrastructure. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | For the year ended 2017, we opened 6 new company-operated and 6 new franchised restaurants. For the year ended 2018, we opened 1 new company-operated and 5 new franchise restaurants. The company plans on opening 6 to 8 new company-operated restaurants and 4 to 6 franchise operated locations in 2019. In addition to the US based franchise locations, our international franchisee in Kuwait opened 1 location in fiscal 2017, no locations in fiscal 2018 and plans on opening 1 to 2 locations in fiscal 2019. 

 
Improve Comparable Restaurant Sales. We plan to improve comparable restaurant sales growth through the following strategies:
 

● | Menu Strategy and Evolution. We will continue to adapt our menu to create entrees that complement our health-inspired offerings and that reinforce our differentiated fast casual positioning. We believe we have opportunities for menu innovation as we look to provide customers more choices through customization and limited time alternative proteins, recipes and other healthier ingredients. Our marketing and operations teams collaborate to ensure that the items developed in our test stores can be executed to our high standards in our restaurants with the speed and value that our customers have come to expect. To provide added variety, from time to time we introduce limited time offerings such as our grass-fed burger bar menu, “wrappy” new year featuring 6 new healthy wraps, fish tacos and other seasonal items. Some of these items have been permanently added to the menu. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Attract New Customers Through Expanded Brand Awareness: We expect to attract new customers as Muscle Maker Grill becomes more widely known due to new restaurant openings and marketing efforts focused on broadening the reach and appeal of our brand. We expect consumers will become more familiar with Muscle Maker Grill as we continue to penetrate our markets, which we believe will benefit our existing restaurant base. Our marketing strategy centers on our “Great Food with Your Health in Mind” campaign, which highlights the desirability of healthy-inspired food and in-house made or proprietary recipe quality of our food. We also utilize social media community engagement and public relations to increase the reach of our brand. Additionally, our system will benefit from increased contributions to our franchise marketing and various franchise advertising funds as we continue to grow our restaurant base.

● | Increase Existing Customer Frequency: We are striving to increase customer frequency by providing a service experience and environment that “complements” the quality of our food and models our culture. We expect to accomplish this by enhancing customer engagement, while also improving throughput, order execution and quality. We not only reward our guests with a great value and guest experience, we reward them for their loyalty as well. Frequent Muscle Maker Grill guests can take advantage of its loyalty program, Muscle Maker Grill Rewards, where points are awarded for every dollar spent towards free or discounted menu items. Members use the Muscle Maker Grill Rewards app to receive notifications announcing new menu items, special events and more. The program is enjoyed by over 25,000 guests today. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Continue to Grow Dayparts: We currently have multiple dayparts and segments where revenue is generated in our restaurants. These dayparts and segments include: breakfast (select locations), lunch, dinner, catering, grab & go (select locations), smoothies/protein shakes and meal plans. We expect to drive growth across these dayparts through enhanced menu offerings, innovative merchandising and marketing campaigns. We plan to continue introducing and marketing limited time offers to increase occasions across our dayparts as well as to educate customers on our lunch and dinner offerings. Muscle Maker Grill has the unique opportunity to grow in the pre-packaged, portion controlled meal plan category. Currently, we offer pre-portioned and packaged meal plans for consumers who want to specifically plan their weekly meals for dietary or nutritional needs. These meal plans can be delivered to a consumer’s home or picked up at each restaurant location. Third party delivery services such as Uber Eats, Grub Hub, DoorDash, Seamless and others offer an expansion beyond the four walls of our restaurants and represents a growing segment of our overall revenue. 

 
Improve Profitability. We continuously look for ways to improve profitability, while also investing in personnel and infrastructure to support our future growth. We will seek to further enhance margins over the long-term by maintaining fiscal discipline and leveraging fixed costs. We constantly focus on restaurant-level operations, including cost controls, while ensuring that we do not sacrifice the quality and service for which we are known. Additionally, as our restaurant base grows, we believe we will be able to leverage support costs as general and administrative expenses grow at a slower rate than our revenues.
 
Our Strengths
 
Iconic and Unique Concept: We provide guests healthier versions of mainstream-favorite dishes that taste great, making it convenient, affordable and enjoyable to eat healthier. Our diverse menu was created for everyone – fitness enthusiasts, those starting their journey to a healthier lifestyle, and people trying to eat better while on-the-go. Now, guests can have delicious, nutritionally balanced food without the regret. More than just food, our restaurants are a friendly, relaxed and social environment where guests can enjoy great-tasting food and engage with fellow health enthusiasts in their area.
 
We are focused on expanding our presence within new and existing markets by continuing to add franchise partners to our system and increasing the number of corporate-owned locations. Our corporate-owned restaurants will focus on an expansion in non-traditional locations such as military bases. The company believes its concept is a unique fit with the military’s “Operation Live Well” campaign and a focus on healthier eating habits.
 
Innovative, Healthier Menu: Providing “Great Food with Your Health in Mind,” Muscle Maker Grill’s menu features items with grass-fed steak, all-natural chicken, lean turkey and plant-based products as well as options that satisfy all dietary preferences – from the carb-free consumer to guests following gluten-free or vegetarian diets. Muscle Maker Grill does not sacrifice taste to serve healthy options. We boast superfoods such as avocado, kale, quinoa, broccoli, romaine and spinach, and use only healthier carb options such as cauliflower or brown rice and whole wheat pasta. We develop and source proprietary sauces and fat free or zero-carb dressings to enhance our unique flavor profiles. Our open style kitchen allows guests to experience our preparation and cooking methods such as an open flame grill and sauté. In addition to our healthier and diverse food platform, Muscle Maker Grill offers 100% real fruit smoothies, boosters and proprietary protein shakes as well as retail supplements

Muscle Maker Grill prides itself on making healthier versions of the guest’s favorite food, giving them easy access to the food they love, without any guilt. This means catering to an array of healthy eating lifestyles. For over 20 years Muscle Maker Grill has been keeping gluten-free diners, low-carb consumers and vegetarians satisfied. We offer 30+ healthier versions of salads, wraps, bowls, sandwiches and flatbreads.
 
Cook to Order Preparation: Our guests can expect to enjoy their healthier meals prepared in less time than a typical fast casual restaurant. While our service time may be slightly higher than the QSR segment, it fits well within the range of the fast-casual segment.
 
Daypart Mix and Revenue Streams: Standard operating hours for a Muscle Maker Grill are from 10:30 AM to 8:30 PM, Monday through Friday, 11:00 AM to 6 PM, Saturday and Sunday. However, many of our locations are closed on Sunday. Our daypart mix is typical to the QSR fast casual segment which is 5% pre-lunch, 45% lunch, 35% dinner and 15% late evening. We have multiple revenue streams including: dine-in, take-out, delivery, catering, meal plans and retail. We also have franchisees that leverage grab & go coolers as well as food trucks.
 
Attractive Price Point and Perceived Value: Muscle Maker Grill offers meals with free ‘power sides’ beginning at $8.99, using only the highest quality ingredients such as grass-fed beef, all natural chicken, whole wheat pastas, brown rice and a power blend of kale, romaine and spinach. Our cook to order method, speed of service, hospitality and the experience of our exhibition style kitchen creates a great value perception for our customers. Meal Plan meals begin at $8 a meal making them not only convenient but affordable too.
 
Delivery: A significant differentiator is that Muscle Maker Grill offers delivery at every location nation-wide. Delivery is an option through our mobile app or online ordering platform making it easy and convenient for our guests. Delivery percentages range from 10% up to 56% of sales. We strongly believe this segment will continue to grow as our core demographic has demonstrated the need for online ordering and delivery versus dine-in and take-out. The company leverages our own employees for local delivery but also uses third party services such as Uber Eats, GrubHub, DoorDash, Seamless and others to fulfill delivery orders.
 
Catering: Our diverse menu items are also offered through our catering program making it easy and affordable to feed a large group. We can feed a group ranging from 10 to 5,000. Our boxed lunch program, which includes a wrap, salad, or entrée, a side and a drink for a set price is available within schools and other organizations.
 
Meal Plans: To make healthier eating even easier, Muscle Maker Grill’s healthier nutritionally-focused menu items are available through its Meal Plan program, allowing pre-orders of meals that taste great via phone, online or in-store, available for pick up or delivered right to their door. Available as five, 10, 15 or 20 meals, guests can choose from 28 Muscle Maker Grill menu items, including the Hollywood Salad, Turkey Meatball Wrap, Arizona and many more.
 
Retail: All Muscle Maker Grill locations participate in our retail merchandising and supplement program. This is a unique revenue stream specific to the Muscle Maker Grill brand and is atypical in the QSR fast casual segment. Guests can purchase our propriety protein in bulk, supplements, boosters, protein and meal replacement bars and cookies. This program gives our guests the opportunity to manage their healthy lifestyle beyond the four walls of our restaurants.
 
Grab and Go Kiosks: Muscle Maker Grill offers grab and go kiosks both in the restaurants and non-traditional locations. The kiosks are comprised of 10 to 12 core meal plan menu items. We have positioned the kiosks so that guests can grab a meal on the run. These meals are convenient to guests that chose not to dine in or want additional meals for themselves or family members.

Our Properties
 
Rent Structure: Our restaurants are typically in-line or food court locations. A typical restaurant generally ranges from 1,200 to 2,500 square feet with seating for approximately 40 people. Our leases for company-operated locations generally have terms of 5 years, with 1 or 2 renewal terms of 5 years. Restaurant leases provide for a specified annual rent, and some leases call for additional or contingent rent based on revenue above specified levels. Generally, our leases are “net leases” that require us to pay a pro rata share of taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. New leases for military locations usually have rent calculated as a percentage of net sales. The company does not guarantee performance or have any liability regarding franchise location leases.
 
System-Wide Restaurant Counts: As of December 31, 2017, our restaurant system consisted of 53 restaurants comprised of 13 company-operated restaurants and 40 franchised restaurants located in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia.
 
Through January 28, 2019, the company closed 8 of the 13 company-operated locations as a cost saving measure while opening 1 new company-operated location in Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The opening of the Fort Sill location represents a strategy shift for company-operated locations to focus on non-traditional restaurants such as military bases or administrative buildings. The company currently has a new second location at Fort Benning under lease/construction.
 
As of February 25, 2019, company-operated, franchised and total system-wide restaurants by jurisdiction are:

Site Selection Process: We consider the location of a restaurant to be a critical variable in its long-term success, and as such, we devote significant effort to the investigation and evaluation of potential restaurant locations. Our in-house management team has extensive experience developing hundreds of locations for various brands. We use a combination of our in-house team and outside real estate consultants to locate, evaluate and negotiate new sites using various criteria including demographic characteristics, daytime population thresholds and traffic patterns, along with the potential visibility of, and accessibility to, the restaurant. The process for selecting locations incorporates management’s and franchisee’s experience and expertise and includes data collection and analysis. Additionally, we use information and intelligence gathered from managers and other restaurant personnel that live in or near the neighborhoods we are considering.
 
A typical Muscle Maker Grill may be free standing or located in malls, airports, gyms, strip shopping centers, health clubs, military bases, non-traditional or highly concentrated business and residential demographic areas. Customers order their food at the counter and food servers deliver the food to the appropriate table. A typical restaurant located in urban and suburban settings ranges from 1,200 to 2,500 square feet. Based on our experience and results, we are currently focused on developing inline sites for franchising and non-traditional locations such as military bases for company-operated locations. Our restaurants can perform well in a variety of neighborhoods, which gives us greater flexibility and lowers operating risk when selecting new restaurant locations.
 
Our Restaurant Design
 
After identifying a lease site, we commence our restaurant buildout. Our typical restaurant is an inline retail space or food court that ranges in size from 1,200 to 2,500 square feet. Our restaurants are characterized by a unique exterior and interior design, color schemes, and layout, including specially designed decor and furnishings. Restaurant interiors incorporate modern designs and rich colors in an effort to provide a clean and inviting environment and fun, family-friendly atmosphere. Each restaurant is designed in accordance with plans we develop; and constructed with a similar design motif and trade dress. Restaurants are generally located near other business establishments that will attract customers who desire healthier food at fair prices served in a casual, fun environment.
 
Our new restaurants are typically inline or food court buildouts. We estimate that each inline or food court buildout of a restaurant will require an average total cash investment of approximately $200,000 to $350,000 net of tenant allowances. On average, it takes us approximately 4 to 6 months from identification of the specific site to opening the restaurant. In order to maintain consistency of food and customer service, as well as our colorful, bright and contemporary restaurant environment, we have set processes and timelines to follow for all restaurant openings.
 
Our restaurants are built-out in approximately 10 weeks and the development and construction of our new sites is the responsibility of our Development Department. Real estate managers are responsible for locating and leasing potential restaurant sites. Construction managers are then responsible for building the restaurants, and several staff members manage purchasing, budgeting, scheduling and other related administrative functions.
 
Our Restaurant Management and Operations
 
Service: We are extremely focused on customer service. We aim to provide fast, friendly service on a solid foundation of dedicated, driven team members and managers. Our cashiers are trained on the menu items we offer and provide customers thoughtful suggestions to enhance the ordering process. Our team members and managers are responsible for our dining room environment, personally visiting tables to ensure every customer’s satisfaction. In most instances, customers order their meals and then relax in our dining areas while enjoying watching TV. Meals are brought to the customers table using actual dishes and customers are free to leave their dishes when finished as team members clear and clean tables as guests leave the restaurant.

Operations: We measure the execution of our system standards within each restaurant through our audit program for quality, service and cleanliness. These audits are conducted periodically and may be more or less frequent based upon restaurant performance. Additionally, we have food safety and quality assurance programs designed to maintain the highest standards for food and food preparation procedures used by both company-operated and franchised restaurants.
 
Managers and Team Members: Each of our restaurants typically has a general manager, and shift leaders. There are between 6 and 10 total team members who prepare our food fresh daily and provide customer service. Overseeing the restaurants is our Vice President of Operations and Director of Operations, jointly responsible for overseeing our company-operated restaurants, and franchise restaurants managing both sales and profitability targets.
 
We are selective in our hiring processes, aiming to staff our restaurants with team members that are friendly, customer focused, and driven to provide high-quality products. Our team members are cross-trained in several disciplines to maximize depth of competency and efficiency in critical restaurant functions.
 
Training: The majority of our company-operated restaurant management staff is comprised of former team members who have advanced along the Muscle Maker Grill career path. Skilled team members who display leadership qualities are encouraged to enter the team leader training program. Successive steps along the management path add increasing levels of duties and responsibilities. Our Franchisee training generally consists of 10-14 days in a certified training location, and an additional 7-10 days post opening training. Our operational team members provide consistent, ongoing training through follow up restaurant visits, inspections, and email/phone correspondences.
 
Our Franchise Program
 
Overview: We use a franchising strategy to increase new restaurant growth in certain US and International markets, leveraging the ownership of entrepreneurs with specific local market expertise and requiring a relatively minimal capital commitment by us. We believe the franchise revenue generated from our franchise base has historically served as an important source of stable and recurring cash flows to us and, as such, we plan to expand our base of franchised restaurants. In existing markets, we encourage growth from current franchisees. In our expansion markets, we seek highly qualified and experienced new franchisees for multi-unit development opportunities. We seek franchisees of successful, non- competitive brands operating in our expansion markets. Through strategic networking and participation in select franchise conferences, we aim to identify highly-qualified prospects. Additionally, we market our franchise opportunities with the support of a franchising section on our website and printed brochures.
 
As of February 2019, the company is not actively selling franchise locations, multi-unit development agreements or area representative agreements but anticipates a new effort in franchise sales beginning in Q2, 2019 as part of our ongoing strategy.
 
Franchise Owner Support: We believe creating a foundation of initial and on-going support is important to future success for both our franchisees and our brand. For that reason, we have structured our corporate staff, programs and communication systems to ensure that we are delivering high-quality support to our franchisees.
 
We have a mandatory training program that was designed to ensure that our franchise owners and their managers are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to position themselves for success. The program consists of hands-on training in the operation and management of the restaurant. Training is conducted by a general training manager who has been certified by us for training. Instructional materials for the initial training program include our operations manual, crew training system, wall charts, job aids, recipe books, product build cards, management training materials, food safety book, videos and other materials we may create from time to time. Training must be successfully completed before a trainee can be assigned to a restaurant as a manager.

We also provide numerous opportunities for communication and shared feedback between us and franchise owners. Currently, we communicate on a frequent basis through email and system wide conference calls allowing for Q&A with all franchisees. In addition, our operations and marketing teams conduct phone calls and on-site visits on a frequent basis with franchisees on current operational changes, new products, revenue generating ideas, cost savings, local store marketing, etc.
 
Franchise Arrangements: Muscle Maker Development, our wholly-owned subsidiary, became the franchisor of Muscle Maker Grill restaurants on August 25, 2017 upon receipt of the operating assets of the franchise system formerly held by Muscle Maker Brands, our former majority-owned subsidiary, which has since been converted into a corporation and merged into Muscle Maker. Muscle Maker Brands had become the franchisor of Muscle Maker Grill restaurants on March 1, 2015 upon receipt of the operating assets of the franchise system formerly held by Muscle Maker Franchising. At the time of the acquisition from Muscle Maker Brands, we succeeded to Muscle Maker Brands’ rights and obligations under 40 franchise agreements for the operation of 40 Muscle Maker Grill franchise restaurants. At December 31, 2017, Muscle Maker Development franchises the operation of a total of 40 Muscle Maker Grill restaurants.
 
The franchise agreements currently:
 

● | Have terms for 15 years, with termination dates ranging from 2023 until 2033. These agreements are generally renewable for terms ranging from 5 to 10 years. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Provide for the payment of initial franchise fees of $35,000. 
● | Require the payment of on-going royalty payments of 5% of net sales at the franchise location. In addition, franchisees contribute 2% (total) of net sales to the marketing and brand development/advertising fund. 

 
Since our acquisition of franchise assets from Muscle Maker Franchising, we have undertaken an extensive review of the terms and conditions of our franchise relationships and have recently finalized the terms of our revised standard franchise agreement and multi-unit development agreement which we intend to govern the relationship between Muscle Maker Development and its new franchisees. Under this franchise agreement:
 

● | Franchisees are licensed the right to use the Muscle Maker Grill® trademarks, its confidential operating manual and other intellectual property in connection with the operation of a Muscle Maker Grill restaurant at a location authorized by us. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Franchisees are protected from the establishment of another Muscle Maker Grill restaurant within a geographic territory, the scope of which is the subject of negotiation between Muscle Maker Development and the franchisee. 
● | The initial term of a franchise is 15 years, which may be renewed for up to two additional terms of five years each. 
● | Franchisees pay Muscle Maker Development an initial franchise fee of $35,000 in a lump sum at the time the Franchise Agreement is signed; however, we may offer financing assistance under certain circumstances. 
● | Franchisees pay Muscle Maker Development an on-going royalty in an amount equal to 5% of Net sales at the franchise location, payable weekly. 
● | Franchisees pay a weekly amount equal to 2% (total) of net sales at the franchise location into a cooperative advertising fund and brand development/advertising fund. The cooperative advertising fee is used by franchisees for local store marketing efforts and the brand development/advertising fund is for the benefit of all locations and is administered by Muscle Maker.

● | A company affiliated with Muscle Maker in 2017 and through June 2018 received a software license fee of $3,500 for our proprietary Muscle Power (R Power) computer software, payable in a lump sum at the time the franchisee orders the required electronic cash register/computer system from our affiliate. As of Q2 2018 Muscle Maker is no longer affiliated with this entity but continues to receive the software license fee of $3,500 per new location. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Franchisees are required to offer only those food products that are authorized by Muscle Maker Development, prepared using our proprietary recipes; and may obtain most supplies only from suppliers that are approved or designated by Muscle Maker Development. 
● | As partial consideration for payment of the initial franchise fee and on-going royalties, Muscle Maker Development loans its franchisees a copy of its confidential operating manual, administers the advertising/brand development fund, and provides franchisees with pre-opening and on-going assistance including site selection assistance, pre-opening training, and in-term training 

 
As of February 2019, we are no longer offering Franchise agreements but anticipate re-launching the program in Q2 of 2019.
 
Multi-Unit Development Agreements: Franchisees who desire to develop more than one restaurant and who have the financial strength and managerial capability to develop more than one restaurant may enter into a Multi-Unit Agreement. Under a multi-unit development agreement, the franchisee agrees to open a specified number of restaurants, at least two, within a defined geographic area in accordance with an agreed upon development schedule. Each restaurant requires the execution of a separate Franchise Agreement, which will be the then current Franchise Agreement, except that the initial franchise fee, royalty and advertising expenditures will be those in effect at the time the multi-unit agreement is executed. Multi-Unit Agreements require the payment of a development fee (the “Development Fee”) equal to $35,000 for the first restaurant plus $17,500 multiplied by the number of additional Muscle Maker Grill® restaurants that must be opened under the Development Agreement. The entire Development Fee is payable at the time the Multi-Unit Agreement is signed; however, the development fee actually paid for a particular restaurant is credited as a deposit against the initial franchise fee that is payable when the Franchise Agreement for the particular franchise is signed.
 
As of February 2019, we are no longer offering Multi-Unit Development agreements but anticipate re-launching the program in Q2 of 2019.
 
Area Representative Agreements: We became the successor franchisor of Muscle Maker Grill restaurants on March 1, 2015 upon the receipt by our former majority-owned subsidiary, Muscle Maker Brands, of the operating assets of the franchise system formerly held by Muscle Maker Franchising. We began to offer franchises as the successor in March 2015. We succeeded as the successor to various area representative agreements that had been entered into by our predecessor, Muscle Maker Franchising. Under the area representative agreements that we succeeded to, the area representatives will identify and refer prospective franchisee candidates to us, provide franchisees with our site selection criteria and assist franchisees to complete a site review package, and will advise franchisees concerning our standards and specifications and make on-site visits, but we retain control of all decision-making authority relative to the franchisees, including franchisee approval, site location approval and determination whether franchisees are in compliance with their franchise agreements.
 
Area representative agreements are generally for a term of 15 years, in consideration for which we generally compensate area representatives with 1% of net sales of the franchises that are under the area representative for the 15 year term.
 
As of February 2019, we are no longer offering Area Representative agreements but anticipate re-launching the program in Q2 of 2019.
 
Our Marketing and Advertising
 
We promote our restaurants and products through multiple advertising campaigns. The campaigns aim to deliver our message of fresh and healthier product offerings. The campaign emphasizes our points of differentiation, from our fresh ingredients and in-house preparation, to the preparation of our healthier inspired meals.

We use multiple marketing channels, including social media such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, email, app notifications, local store marketing, public relations/press releases and other methods to broadly drive brand awareness and purchases of our featured products. We complement this periodically with direct mail and our Muscle Maker Grill Rewards mobile app and e-mail marketing program, which allows us to reach more than 25,000 members. Muscle Maker Grill Rewards is our e-club and loyalty program. We engage members via e-mails and push notifications featuring news of promotional offers, member rewards and product previews.
 
Our Purchasing and Distribution
 
Maintaining a high degree of quality in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. We contract with Sysco, a major foodservice distributor, for substantially all of our food and supplies. Food and supplies are delivered to most of our restaurants one to two times per week. Our distributor relationship with Sysco has been in place since 2007. Our franchisees are required to use our primary distributor, or an approved regional distributor and franchisees must purchase food and supplies from approved suppliers. In our normal course of business, we evaluate bids from multiple suppliers for various products. Fluctuations in supply and prices can significantly impact our restaurant service and profit performance.
Our Intellectual Property
 
We have registered Muscle Maker Grill® and certain other names used by our restaurants as trademarks or service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and Muscle Maker Grill® in approximately two foreign countries. Our brand campaign, Great Food with Your Health in Mind™, has also been approved for registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, the Muscle Maker Grill logo, website name and address and Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts are our intellectual property. Our policy is to pursue and maintain registration of service marks and trademarks in those countries where business strategy requires us to do so and to oppose vigorously any infringement or dilution of the service marks or trademarks in such countries. We maintain the recipe for our healthy inspired recipes, as well as certain proprietary standards, specifications and operating procedures, as trade secrets or confidential proprietary information.
Our Competition
 
We operate in the restaurant industry, which is highly competitive and fragmented. The number, size and strength of competitors vary by region. Our competition includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains that offer dine-in, carry-out and delivery services. Our competition in the broadest perspective includes restaurants, pizza parlors, convenience food stores, delicatessens, supermarkets and club stores. However, we indirectly compete with fast casual restaurants, including Chipotle and Panera Bread, among others, and with healthy inspired fast casual restaurants, such as the Protein Bar, Freshii and Veggie Grill, among others.
 
We believe competition within the fast-casual restaurant segment is based primarily on ambience, price, taste, quality and the freshness of the menu items. We also believe that QSR competition is based primarily on quality, taste, speed of service, value, brand recognition, restaurant location and customer service.
 
As consumer preferences continue to evolve into healthier eating options, most restaurants are developing healthier menu options. As more restaurants offer healthier options, the competition for our product offerings becomes more intense and could pose a significant threat to future revenues. However, we believe our experience, size and flexibility allows Muscle Maker to adapt faster than many other restaurant chains.

Our Management Information Systems
 
All of our company-operated and franchised restaurants use computerized point-of-sale and back office systems, which we believe are scalable to support our long-term growth plans. The point-of-sale system provides a touch screen interface and a stand-alone high speed credit card and gift card processing terminal. The point-of-sale system is used to collect daily transaction data, which generates information about daily sales and product mix that we actively analyze.
 
Our in-restaurant back office computer system is designed to assist in the management of our restaurants and provide labor and food cost management tools. The system also provides corporate headquarters and restaurant operations management quick access to detailed business data and reduces the time spent by our restaurant managers on administrative needs. The system also provides sales, bank deposit and variance data to our accounting department.
