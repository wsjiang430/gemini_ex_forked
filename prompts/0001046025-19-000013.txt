ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Heritage Financial Corporation is a bank holding company that was incorporated in the State of Washington in August 1997. We are primarily engaged in the business of planning, directing, and coordinating the business activities of our wholly owned subsidiary, Heritage Bank (the "Bank"). The deposits of the Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC"). 
Heritage Bank is headquartered in Olympia, Washington and conducts business from its 64 branch offices located primarily along the I-5 corridor in the western Washington and the greater Portland, Oregon area. We additionally have offices located in central Washington, primarily in Yakima County.
Our business consists primarily of commercial lending and deposit relationships with small and medium sized businesses and their owners in our market areas, and attracting deposits from the general public. We also make real estate construction and land development loans and consumer loans. The Bank also originates for sale or investment purposes one-to-four family residential loans on residential properties located primarily in our market.
Business Strategy
Our business strategy is to be a community bank, seeking deposits from our communities and making loans to customers with local ties to our markets. We believe we have an innovative team providing financial services and focusing on the success of our customers. We are committed to being the leading community bank in the Pacific Northwest by continuously improving customer satisfaction, employee empowerment, community investment and shareholder value. Our commitment defines our relationships, sets expectations for our actions and directs decision-making in these four fundamental areas. We will seek to achieve our business goals through the following strategies:
Expand geographically as opportunities present themselves.    We are committed to continuing the controlled expansion of our franchise through strategic acquisitions designed to increase our market share and enhance franchise value. We believe that consolidation across the community bank landscape will continue to take place and further believe that, with our capital and liquidity positions, our approach to credit management, and our extensive acquisition experience, we are well-positioned to take advantage of acquisitions or other business opportunities in our market areas. In markets where we wish to enter or expand our business, we will also consider opening de novo branches. In the past, we have successfully integrated acquired institutions and opened de novo branches. We will continue to be disciplined and opportunistic as it pertains to future acquisitions and de novo branching, focusing on the Pacific Northwest markets we know and understand.
Focus on Asset Quality.    A strong credit culture is a high priority for us. We have a well-developed credit approval structure that has enabled us to maintain a standard of asset quality that we believe is conservative while at the same time allowing us to achieve our lending objectives. We will continue to focus on loan types and markets that we know well and where we have a historical record of success. We focus on loan relationships that are well-diversified in both size and industry types. With respect to commercial business lending, which is our predominant lending activity, 
5

we view ourselves as cash-flow lenders obtaining additional support from realistic collateral values, personal guarantees and other secondary sources of repayment. We have a problem loan resolution process that is focused on quick detection and implementing feasible solutions. We seek to maintain strong internal controls and subject our loans to periodic internal loan reviews.
Maintain Strong Balance Sheet.    In addition to our focus on underwriting, we believe that the strength of our balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to manage through a variety of scenarios including additional growth-related activities. As of December 31, 2018, the ratio of our allowance for loan losses to loans receivable, net was 0.96% and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was 255.73%. Our liquidity position was also strong, with $161.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the regulatory capital ratios of our subsidiary bank were well in excess of the levels required for “well-capitalized” status, and our consolidated common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and leverage capital ratios were 11.7%, 12.9% 12.1% and 10.5%, respectively.
Deposit Growth.    Our strategic focus is to continuously grow deposits with emphasis on total relationship banking with our business and retail customers. We continue to seek to increase our market share in the communities we serve by providing exceptional customer service, focusing on relationship development with local businesses and strategic branch expansion. Our primary focus is to maintain a high level of non-maturity deposits to internally fund our loan growth with a low reliance on maturity (certificate) deposits. At December 31, 2018, our non-maturity deposits were 89.5% of our total deposits. Our technology-based products, including on-line personal financial management, business cash management and business remote deposit products enable us to compete effectively with banks of all sizes. Our retail and commercial management teams are well-seasoned and have strong ties to the communities we serve with a strong focus on relationship building and customer service.
Emphasize business relationships with a focus on commercial lending.    We will continue to market primarily commercial business loans and the deposit balances that accompany these relationships. Our seasoned lending staff has extensive knowledge and can add value through a focused advisory role that we believe strengthens our customer relationships and develops loyalty. We currently have and will seek to maintain a diversified portfolio of lending relationships without significant concentrations in any industry.
Recruit and retain highly competent personnel to execute our strategies.    Our compensation and staff development programs are aligned with our strategies to grow our loans and core deposits while maintaining our focus on asset quality. Our incentive systems are designed to achieve balanced, high quality asset growth while maintaining appropriate mechanisms to reduce or eliminate incentive payments when appropriate. Our equity compensation programs and retirement benefits are designed to build and encourage employee ownership at all levels of the Company and we align employee performance objectives with corporate growth strategies and shareholder value. We have a strong corporate culture, which is supported by our commitment to internal development and promotion from within as well as the retention of management and officers in key roles. 
History
Heritage Bank celebrated its 90th anniversary during 2017. The Bank was established in 1927 as a federally-charted mutual savings bank. In 1992, the Bank converted to a state-charted mutual savings bank under the name Heritage Savings Bank. Through the mutual holding company reorganization of the Bank and the subsequent conversion of the mutual holding company, the Bank became a stock savings bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company effective August 1997. Effective September 1, 2004, Heritage Savings Bank switched its charter from a state-chartered savings bank to a state-chartered commercial bank and changed its legal name from Heritage Savings Bank to Heritage Bank.
The Company acquired North Pacific Bancorporation in June 1998 and Washington Independent Bancshares and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Central Valley Bank, in March 1999. In June 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of Western Washington Bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiary, Washington State Bank, N.A., at which time Washington State Bank, N.A. was merged into Heritage Bank. 
Effective July 30, 2010, Heritage Bank entered into a definitive agreement with the FDIC, pursuant to which Heritage Bank acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Cowlitz Bank, a Washington state-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Longview, Washington. The acquisition included nine branches of Cowlitz Bank, including its division Bay Bank, which opened as branches of Heritage Bank on August 2, 2010. The acquisition also included the Trust Services Division of Cowlitz Bank. 
Effective November 5, 2010, Heritage Bank entered into a definitive agreement with the FDIC, pursuant to which Heritage Bank acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Pierce Commercial Bank, a Washington state-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Tacoma, Washington. The acquisition included one branch, which opened as a branch of Heritage Bank on November 8, 2010.

On September 14, 2012, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement along with Heritage Bank, to acquire Northwest Commercial Bank, a full-service commercial bank headquartered in Lakewood, Washington that operated two branch locations in Washington State. The acquisition was completed on January 9, 2013, at which time Northwest Commercial Bank was merged with and into Heritage Bank. 
On March 11, 2013, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Valley Community Bancshares, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Valley Bank, both headquartered in Puyallup, Washington, and its eight branches. The acquisition was completed on July 15, 2013. 
On April 8, 2013, the Company announced its intent to merge two of its wholly-owned bank subsidiaries, Central Valley Bank and Heritage Bank, with Central Valley Bank merging into Heritage Bank. The common control merger was completed on June 19, 2013. Central Valley Bank operated as a division of Heritage Bank until September 2018 at which time the five Central Valley Bank branches were renamed to Heritage Bank branches.
On October 23, 2013, the Company, the Bank, Washington Banking Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary bank, Whidbey Island Bank, jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which Heritage and Washington Banking Company entered into a strategic merger with Washington Banking Company merging into Heritage ("Washington Banking Merger"). Washington Banking Company branches adopted the Heritage Bank name in all markets, with the exception of six branches in Whidbey Island markets which continue to operate using the Whidbey Island Bank name, as a division of Heritage Bank. The Washington Banking Merger was completed on May 1, 2014. 
On July 26, 2017, the Company announced the execution of a definitive agreement to purchase Puget Sound Bancorp, Inc., ("Puget Sound"), the holding company of Puget Sound Bank, a one-branch business bank headquartered in Bellevue, Washington (the "Puget Sound Merger"). The Puget Sound Merger was completed on January 16, 2018.
On March 8, 2018, the Company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to purchase Premier Commercial Bancorp ("Premier Commercial"), the holding company for Premier Community Bank, both of Hillsboro, Oregon, and its six branches (the "Premier Merger"). The Premier Merger was completed on July 2, 2018.
For additional information regarding the Puget Sound Merger and Premier Merger (collectively the "Premier and Puget Mergers"), see Note (2) Business Combinations of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements And Supplementary Data.
Retail Banking
We offer a full range of products and services to customers for personal and business banking needs designed to attract both short-term and long-term deposits. Deposits are our primary source of funds. Our personal and business banking customers have the option of selecting from a variety of accounts. The major categories of deposit accounts that we offer are described below. These accounts, with the exception of noninterest demand accounts, generally earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management’s desire to increase or decrease certain types or maturities of deposits.
Noninterest Demand Deposits.    Deposits are noninterest bearing and may be charged service fees based on activity and balances.
Interest Bearing Demand Deposits.    Deposits are interest bearing and may be charged service fees based on activity and balances. Interest bearing demand deposits pay interest, but require a higher minimum balance to avoid service charges.
Money Market Accounts.    Deposits pay an interest rate that is tiered depending on the balance maintained in the account. Minimum opening balances vary.
Savings Accounts.    Deposits are interest bearing and allow for unlimited deposits and withdrawals, provided that a minimum balance is maintained.
Certificate of Deposit Accounts.    Deposits require a minimum deposit of $2,500 and have maturities ranging from three months to five years. Jumbo certificate of deposit accounts are offered in amounts of $100,000 or more for terms of 30 days to five years.
Our personal checking accounts feature an array of benefits and options, including online banking, online statements, mobile banking with mobile deposit, VISA debit cards and access to more than 32,000 surcharge free Automated Teller Machines ("ATMs") through the MoneyPass network. 
We also offer trust services through trust powers in the states of Washington and Oregon, and a Wealth Management department that provides objective advice from trusted advisors.

Lending Activities
Our lending activities are conducted through Heritage Bank. While our focus is on commercial business lending, we also originate consumer loans, real estate construction and land development loans and one-to-four family residential loans. Our loans are originated under policies that are reviewed and approved annually by our Board of Directors. In addition, we have established internal lending guidelines that are updated as needed. These policies and guidelines address underwriting standards, structure and rate considerations, and compliance with laws, regulations and internal lending limits. We conduct post-approval reviews on selected loans and routinely perform internal loan reviews of our loan portfolio to confirm credit quality, proper documentation and compliance with laws and regulations. Loan repayments are considered one of the primary sources of funding for the Bank.
The Company has also acquired loans through mergers and acquisitions, which are designated as "purchased" loans.
Commercial Business Lending
We offer different types of commercial business loans, including lines of credit, term equipment financing and term owner-occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans. We also originate loans that are guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”), for which Heritage Bank is a “preferred lender”, and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. Before extending credit to a business we review and analyze the borrower’s management ability, financial history, including cash flow of the borrower and all guarantors, and the liquidation value of the collateral. Emphasis is placed on having a comprehensive understanding of the borrower’s global cash flow and performing necessary financial due diligence.
At December 31, 2018 we had $2.94 billion, or 80.4%, of our loans receivable, net in commercial business loans with an average outstanding loan balance of approximately $476,000 at December 31, 2018, excluding loans with no outstanding balance.
We originate commercial real estate loans within our primary market areas with a preference for loans secured by owner-occupied properties. Our underwriting standards require that non-owner occupied and owner occupied commercial real estate loans not exceed 75% and 80%, respectively, of the lower of appraised value at origination or cost of the underlying collateral. Cash flow debt coverage requirements range from 1.15 times to 1.25 times, depending on the type of property. We also stress test debt coverage using an “underwriting” interest rate that is higher than the note rate.
Commercial real estate loans typically involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential loans. Payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are dependent on successful operation and management of the properties and repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. We seek to minimize these risks by determining the financial condition of the borrower and tenants, the quality and value of the collateral, and the management of the property securing the loan. We also generally obtain personal guarantees from the owners of the collateral after a thorough review of personal financial statements. In addition, we review our commercial real estate loan portfolio annually for performance of individual loans, and stress-test loans for potential changes in interest rates, occupancy, and collateral values.
See also Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our loan portfolio is concentrated in loans with a higher risk of loss.
The Bank enters into non-hedging interest rate swap contracts with its commercial customers, as necessary, to accommodate the business needs of borrowers. For additional information, see Note (15) Derivative Financial Instruments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements And Supplementary Data. 
One-to-Four Family Residential Loans, Originations and Sales
At December 31, 2018, one-to-four family residential loans totaled $101.8 million. The majority of our one-to-four family residential loans are secured by single-family residences located in our primary market areas. Our underwriting standards require that one-to-four family residential loans generally are owner-occupied and do not exceed 80% of the lower of appraised value at origination or cost of the underlying collateral. Terms typically range from 15 to 30 years. 
As part of our asset/liability management strategy, we typically sell a significant portion of our one-to-four family residential loans in the secondary market with no recourse and servicing released. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations—Asset/Liability Management. We did not service any of these sold loans during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.

Real Estate Construction and Land Development
At December 31, 2018, we had $215.5 million of real estate construction and land development loans. We originate one-to-four family residential construction loans for the construction of custom homes (where the home buyer is the borrower). We also provide financing to builders for the construction of pre-sold homes and, in selected cases, to builders for the construction of speculative residential property. Because of the higher risks present in the residential construction industry, our lending to builders is limited to those who have demonstrated a favorable record of performance and who are building in markets that management understands.
We further endeavor to limit our construction lending risk through adherence to strict underwriting guidelines and procedures. Speculative construction loans are short term in nature and have a variable rate of interest. We require builders to have tangible equity in each construction project and have prompt and thorough documentation of all draw requests, and we inspect the project prior to paying any draw requests.
See also Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our loan portfolio is concentrated in loans with a higher risk of loss.
Consumer
At December 31, 2018, we had $395.5 million of consumer loans. We originate consumer loans and lines of credit that are both secured and unsecured. The majority of our consumer loans are for relatively small amounts disbursed among many individual borrowers.
We also originate indirect consumer loans. These loans are for new and used automobile and recreational vehicles that are originated indirectly by selected dealers located in our market areas. We have limited our indirect loans purchased primarily to dealerships that are established and well-known in their market areas and to applicants that are not classified as sub-prime.
Liquidity
As indicated above, our primary sources of funds are deposits and loan repayments. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposits and unscheduled loan prepayments, which are influenced significantly by general interest rate levels, interest rates available on other investments, competition, economic conditions and other factors, may not be stable. Customer deposits remain an important source of funding, but these balances have been influenced in the past by adverse market conditions in the industry and may be affected by future developments such as interest rate fluctuations and new competitive pressures. In addition to customer deposits, management may utilize brokered deposits on an as-needed basis and repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2018, we had brokered deposits of $28.1 million and securities sold under agreement to repurchase of $31.5 million which were secured by investment securities available for sale.
As secondary sources of funding, we might utilize other borrowings on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds (such as deposit inflows at less than projected levels). Borrowings may also be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending activities and match the maturity of repricing intervals of assets. Other borrowings include advances from Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Des Moines and other credit facilities.
Federal Home Loan Bank:
The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines which is one of 11 regional FHLBs that administer the home financing credit function of savings institutions. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its member financial institutions within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. It makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures, established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. We rely upon advances from the FHLB as a secondary source of liquidity to supplement our supply of lendable funds and meet deposit withdrawal requirements. Advances are made pursuant to several different programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based on a percentage of an institution’s assets or on the FHLB’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness. Under its current credit policies, the FHLB of Des Moines limits advances to 35% of the Bank's assets.
Advances from the FHLB of Des Moines are typically secured by our first lien one-to-four family residential loans, commercial real estate loans and stock issued by the FHLB, which is owned by us. At December 31, 2018, the Bank maintained a credit facility with the FHLB of Des Moines in the amount of $921.7 million, of which there were no advances.
For membership purposes, the Bank is required to maintain an investment in the stock of the FHLB of Des Moines in an amount equal to 0.12% of the Bank's assets as calculated on an annual basis. In addition to the FHLB stock required for membership, the Bank must purchase activity stock equal to 4.0% of all outstanding borrowing 
9

balances. The activity stock is automatically redeemed in amounts equal to the FHLB advance balances as they are repaid. At December 31, 2018 the Bank had an investment in stock issued by the FHLB of Des Moines carried at a cost basis (par value) of $6.1 million, which entirely represented its membership stock. The Bank was not required to have any activity stock because it did not have any outstanding FHLB advance balance at December 31, 2018. 
Other borrowings:
In addition to liquidity provided by FHLB, the Bank maintained an uncommitted credit facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco of $37.4 million, of which there were no advances or borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2018. The Bank also maintains advance lines with Wells Fargo Bank, US Bank, The Independent Bankers Bank and Pacific Coast Bankers’ Bank to purchase federal funds of up to $90.0 million, of which there were no advances or borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2018. 
Supervision and Regulation
We are subject to extensive legislation, regulation, and supervision under federal law and the law of Washington State, which are primarily intended to protect depositors and the FDIC, and not shareholders. The laws and regulations affecting banks and bank holding companies have changed significantly particularly in connection with the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau (“CFPB”) as an independent bureau of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”). The CFPB assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. See “—Other Regulatory Developments—The Dodd-Frank Act” herein for a discussion of this legislation. Any change in applicable laws, regulations, or regulatory policies may have a material effect on our business, operations, and prospects. We cannot predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that any fiscal or monetary policies or new Federal or State legislation may have in the future.
The following is a summary discussion of certain laws and regulations applicable to Heritage and Heritage Bank which is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations.
Heritage Financial    
As a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve, we are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ("BHCA"), and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. This regulation and supervision is generally intended to ensure that we limit our activities to those allowed by law and that we operate in a safe and sound manner without endangering the financial health of Heritage Bank. We are required to file annual and periodic reports with the Federal Reserve and provide additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve may examine us, and any of our subsidiaries, and assess us for the cost of such examination.
The Federal Reserve has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders, or require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiary). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. The Company is also required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with, the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The Federal Reserve may also order termination of non-banking activities by non-banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies, or divestiture of ownership and control of a non-banking subsidiary by a bank holding company. Some violations may also result in criminal penalties. 
The Federal Reserve has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, the Dodd Frank Act and Federal Reserve policy provides that a bank holding company shall be required to serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary bank. A bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks is generally considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve’s regulations or both.
Under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, a bank holding company with an undercapitalized subsidiary bank must guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required to be implemented for its undercapitalized subsidiary bank. If an undercapitalized subsidiary bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan the Federal Reserve may, among other restrictions, prohibit the bank holding company or its undercapitalized subsidiary bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Federal Reserve policy also provides that a bank holding company may pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividend and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with 
10

the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. A bank holding company or bank that does not meet the capital conservation buffer requirement is subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends. See “—Capital Adequacy” below. In addition, under Washington corporate law, a company generally may not pay dividends if after that payment the company would not be able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business, or its total assets would be less than its total liabilities.
We, and any subsidiaries which we may control, are considered “affiliates” of the Bank within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between our bank subsidiary and affiliates are subject to numerous restrictions. With some exceptions, we and our subsidiaries are prohibited from tying the provision of various products or services, such as extensions of credit, to other products or services offered by us, or our affiliates.
Bank regulations require bank holding companies and banks to maintain minimum capital ratios. For additional information, see “—Capital Adequacy” below.
Subsidiary Bank
Heritage Bank is a Washington state-chartered commercial bank, the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC. Heritage Bank is subject to regulation by the FDIC and the Division of Banks of the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions ("Division").
Applicable Federal and State statutes and regulations which govern a bank’s operations relate to minimum capital requirements, required reserves against deposits, investments, loans, legal lending limits, mergers and consolidation, borrowings, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches, and other aspects of its operations, among other things. The Division and the FDIC also have authority to prohibit banks under their supervision from engaging in what they consider to be unsafe and unsound practices.
The Bank is required to file periodic reports with the FDIC and the Division and is subject to periodic examinations and evaluations by those regulatory authorities. Based upon these evaluations, the regulators may revalue the assets of an institution and require that it establish specific reserves to compensate for the differences between the determined value and the book value of such assets. These examinations must be conducted at least every 12 months.
Dividends paid by the Bank provide substantially all of our cash flow. The FDIC and the Division also have the general authority to restrict capital distributions by the Bank, including dividends paid by the Bank to Heritage. Such restrictions are generally tied to the Bank’s capital levels after giving effect to such distributions. For additional information regarding the restrictions on the payment of dividends, see ”—Capital Adequacy" below and Item 5. Market For Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters And Issuer Purchases Of Equity Securities herein.
Capital Adequacy    
The Federal Reserve and FDIC have issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies and banks. In addition, these regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a bank holding company or bank maintain capital above the minimum levels, based on its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth.
Effective January 1, 2015 (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness over several years), the Company and the Bank became subject to new capital regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, which establish minimum required risk-based ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 and total capital, as well as a minimum leverage ratio risk-weightings of assets and certain other assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios; require an additional capital conservation buffer over the minimum required risk-based capital ratios; and define what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. These regulations implement the regulatory capital reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Act and the “Basel III” requirements.
Under these capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total adjusted assets) of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net unless an institution elects to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net from regulatory capital; and certain minority interests; all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 1 capital generally consists of CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of other preferred stock and subordinated debt meeting certain conditions plus an amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.
In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1, leverage ratio and total capital ratios, the Company and the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, 
11

repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. The new capital conservation buffer requirement began to be phased in on January 1, 2016, when requiring a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, was required which amount increased 0.625% each year until the buffer requirement was fully implemented on January 1, 2019.
To be considered "well capitalized," a bank holding company must have, on a consolidated basis, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and must not be subject to an individual order, directive or agreement under which the Federal Reserve requires it to maintain a specific capital level. To be considered “well capitalized,” a depository institution must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.5% and a leverage ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to an individualized order, directive or agreement under which its primary federal banking regulator requires it to maintain a specific capital level. As of December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank met the requirements to be "well capitalized" and the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement.
 For a complete description of the Company’s and the Bank's required and actual capital levels as of December 31, 2018, see Note (22) Regulatory Capital Requirements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements And Supplementary Data.
Prompt Corrective Action    
Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework for FDIC-insured institutions based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution’s category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures. The well capitalized category is described above. An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits generally. To be considered adequately capitalized, an institution must have the minimum capital ratios described above. Any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized.
Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized. Failure by Heritage Bank to comply with applicable capital requirements would result in progressively more severe restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator. Banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements.
As of December 31, 2018, the Bank met the requirements to be classified as “well capitalized.” See Note (22) Regulatory Capital Requirements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements And Supplementary Data.
Classification of Loans
Federal regulations require the Bank to periodically evaluate the risks inherent in its loan portfolio. In addition, the Division and the FDIC have the authority to identify adverse loans and, if appropriate, require them to be reclassified. There are three types of classified loans: Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss. Substandard loans have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful loans have the weaknesses of Substandard loans, with additional characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values questionable. There is a high probability of some loss in loans classified as Doubtful. A loan classified as Loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as a loan of the institution is not warranted. If a loan or a portion of the loan is classified as Loss, the institution must charge-off this amount. 
Deposit Insurance and Other FDIC Programs    
The deposits of the Bank are insured up to $250,000 per separately insured category by the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures the deposits, up to applicable limits, of depository institutions. As insurer of the Bank's deposits, the FDIC has supervisory and enforcement authority over Heritage Bank and this insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by institutions insured by the FDIC. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the institution and the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition.

The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act raised set the minimum designated reserve ratio (“DRR”) of the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) at 1.35%, required the FDIC to set a target DRR each year, and eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The FDIC has set the target DRR at 2.0% and adopted a plan to achieve that target ratio. The FDIC has announced that the DRR surpassed 1.35% as of September 30, 2018. Currently, total base assessment rates range- from 1.5 to 40 basis points on an annualized basis, subject to certain adjustments. Under current regulations, the ranges of assessment rates are scheduled to decrease as the DRR increases in increments above 2.0%. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment.
Other Regulatory Developments    
Significant federal legislation affecting banking has been enacted in recent years. The following summarizes some of such recent significant federal legislation.
The Dodd-Frank Act.    The Dodd-Frank-Act imposes restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions and implements new capital regulations that we are subject to and that are discussed above under “—Capital Adequacy.”
The federal banking and securities regulators have issued final rules to implement Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the “Volcker Rule” pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. Generally, subject to a transition period and certain exceptions, the Volcker Rule restricts insured depository institutions and their affiliated companies from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, investing in funds with collateral comprised of any loans that are not registered with the SEC and from engaging in hedging activities that do not hedge a specific identified risk. In accordance with the transition period, the Volcker Rule prohibitions and restrictions apply to banking entities, including the Company and the Bank, unless an exception applies. We are continuously reviewing our investment portfolio to determine if changes to our investment strategies may be required in order to comply with the various provisions of the Volcker Rule.
In addition, among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies, like us, to (i) provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote (a) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers and (b) at least once every six years on whether they should have a “say on pay” vote every one, two or three years; (ii) have a separate, non-binding shareholder vote regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; (iii) provide disclosure in annual proxy materials concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer; and (iv) amend Item 402 of Regulation S-K to require companies to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. 
Economic Growth Act.    In May 2018 the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Economic Growth Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory changes for community banks such as the Bank, and their holding companies.
The Economic Growth Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” of between 8 and 10 percent. Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the “community bank leverage ratio” will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered to be “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules. In addition, the Economic Growth Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.
It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the Economic Growth Act will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact the Act and the yet-to-be-written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks.

CECL. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard for U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles that will be effective for us for our first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, requires FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies (banking organizations) to recognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader range of assets than the current method of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, a banking organization must record a one-time adjustment to its credit loss allowances as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of credit loss allowances under the current methodology and the amount required under CECL. For a banking organization, implementation of CECL is generally likely to reduce retained earnings, and to affect other items, in a manner that reduces its regulatory capital.
The federal banking regulators (the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC) have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a public company that files periodic reports with the SEC, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Heritage is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees. Our policies and procedures have been updated to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Website Access to Company Reports
We post publicly available reports required to be filed with the SEC on our website, www.hf-wa.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such reports. The required reports are available free of charge through our website.
Code of Ethics
We have adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and controller. We have posted the text of our Code of Ethics at www.hf-wa.com in the section titled Overview: Governance Documents. Any waivers of the code of ethics will be publicly disclosed to shareholders.
Competition
We compete for loans and deposits with other commercial banks, credit unions, mortgage bankers, and other providers of financial services, including finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and more recently with financial technology (or "FinTech") companies that rely on technology to provide financial services. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do. Particularly in times of high or rising interest rates, we also face significant competition for investors’ funds from short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities.
We compete for loans principally through the range and quality of the services we provide, interest rates and loan fees, and the locations of our Bank's branches. We actively solicit deposit-related clients and compete for deposits by offering depositors a variety of savings accounts, checking accounts, cash management and other services.
Employees
We had 859 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2018. We believe that employees play a vital role in the success of a service company. Employees are provided with a variety of benefits such as medical, vision, dental and life insurance, a retirement plan, and paid vacations and sick leave. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
