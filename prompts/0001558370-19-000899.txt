 ITEM 1—BUSINESS
 Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 2004. The principal executive office is located in Louisville, Kentucky.
 General Development of Business
 The Company is a growing restaurant company operating predominately in the casual dining segment. Our founder, chairman and chief executive officer, W. Kent Taylor, started the business in 1993 with the opening of the first Texas Roadhouse restaurant in Clarksville, Indiana. Since then, we have grown to 582 restaurants in 49 states and nine foreign countries. Our mission statement is "Legendary Food, Legendary Service®." Our operating strategy is designed to position each of our restaurants as the local hometown favorite for a broad segment of consumers seeking high quality, affordable meals served with friendly, attentive service. As of December 25, 2018, we owned and operated 491 restaurants and franchised an additional 69 domestic restaurants and 22 international restaurants.  Financial Information about Operating Segments
 We consider our restaurant and franchising operations as similar and have aggregated them into a single reportable segment. The majority of the restaurants operate in the U.S. within the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry, providing similar products to similar customers, and possessing similar pricing structures, resulting in similar long‑term expected financial performance characteristics. Each of our 491 company restaurants is considered an operating segment.   Narrative Description of Business
 Of the 491 restaurants we owned and operated at the end of 2018, we operated 464 as Texas Roadhouse restaurants and 25 as Bubba’s 33 restaurants. In addition, we operated two restaurants outside of the casual dining segment. In 2019, we plan to open 25 to 30 company restaurants.  While the majority of our restaurant growth in 2019 will be Texas Roadhouse restaurants, we currently expect to open as many as four Bubba’s 33 restaurants.  Throughout this report, we use the term "restaurants" to include Texas Roadhouse and Bubba’s 33, unless otherwise noted.
 Texas Roadhouse is a moderately priced, full‑service, casual dining restaurant concept offering an assortment of specially seasoned and aged steaks hand‑cut daily on the premises and cooked to order over open grills. In addition to steaks, we also offer our guests a selection of ribs, seafood, chicken, pork chops, pulled pork and vegetable plates, and an assortment of hamburgers, salads and sandwiches. The majority of our entrées include two made‑from‑scratch side items, and we offer all our guests a free unlimited supply of roasted in‑shell peanuts and fresh baked yeast rolls.
 Bubba’s 33 is a family-friendly, sports restaurant concept featuring scratch-made food, ice cold beer and signature drinks. Our menu features burgers, pizza and wings as well as a wide variety of appetizers, sandwiches and dinner entrées. Our first Bubba’s 33 restaurant opened in May 2013 in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
 The operating strategy that underlies the growth of our concepts is built on the following key components:

· | Offering high quality, freshly prepared food. We place a great deal of emphasis on providing our guests with high quality, freshly prepared food. As part of our process, we have developed proprietary recipes to provide consistency in quality and taste throughout all restaurants. We expect a management level employee to inspect every entrée before it leaves the kitchen to confirm it matches the guest’s order and meets our standards for quality, appearance and presentation. In addition, we employ a team of product coaches whose function is to provide continual, hands‑on training and education to our kitchen staff for the purpose of promoting consistent adherence to recipes, food preparation procedures, food safety standards, food appearance, freshness and portion size. At our Texas Roadhouse restaurants, we hand‑cut all but one of our assortment of steaks and make our sides from scratch.

· | Offering performance‑based manager compensation. We offer a performance‑based compensation program to our individual restaurant managers and multi‑restaurant operators, who are called "managing partners" and "market partners," respectively. Each of these partners earns a base salary plus a performance bonus, which represents a percentage of each of their respective restaurant’s pre‑tax income. By providing our partners with a significant stake in the success of our restaurants, we believe that we are able to attract and retain talented, experienced and highly motivated managing and market partners. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focusing on dinner. In a high percentage of our restaurants, we limit our operating hours to dinner only during the weekdays with approximately one half of our restaurants offering lunch on Friday. By focusing on dinner, our restaurant teams have to prepare for and manage only one shift per day during the week. We believe this allows our restaurant teams to offer higher quality, more consistent food and service to our guests. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Offering attractive price points. We offer our food and beverages at moderate price points that we believe are as low as or lower than those offered by many of our competitors. Within each menu category, we offer a choice of several price points with the goal of fulfilling each guest’s budget and value expectations. For example, at our Texas Roadhouse restaurants, our steak entrées, which include the choice of two side items, generally range from $10.99 for our 6‑ounce Sirloin to $26.99 for our 23‑ounce Porterhouse T‑Bone. The per guest average check for the Texas Roadhouse restaurants we owned and operated in 2018 was $17.09. Per guest average check represents restaurant sales divided by the number of guests served. We consider each sale of an entrée to be a single guest served. Our per guest average check is higher as a result of our weekday dinner only focus. At our Bubba’s 33 restaurants, our entrées range from $9.79 for our Classic Cheeseburger to $19.99 for our 16 inch Meaty Meaty pizza. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Creating a fun and comfortable atmosphere with a focus on high quality service. We believe the service quality and atmosphere we establish in our restaurants is a key component for fostering repeat business. We focus on keeping our table‑to‑server ratios low to allow our servers to truly focus on their guests and serve their needs in a personal, individualized manner. Our Texas Roadhouse restaurants feature a rustic southwestern lodge décor accentuated with hand‑painted murals, neon signs, and southwestern prints, rugs and artifacts. Additionally, we offer jukeboxes, which continuously play upbeat country hits. Our Bubba’s 33 restaurants feature walls lined with televisions playing sports events and music videos and are decorated with sports jerseys, neon signs and other local flair. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Unit Prototype and Economics
 We design our restaurant prototypes to provide a relaxed atmosphere for our guests, while also focusing on restaurant‑level returns over time. Our current prototypical Texas Roadhouse restaurants consist of a freestanding building with approximately 7,200 to 7,500 square feet of space constructed on sites of approximately 1.7 to 2.0 acres or retail pad sites, with seating of approximately 58 to 68 tables for a total of 270 to 300 guests, including 18 bar seats, and parking for approximately 160 vehicles either on‑site or in combination with some form of off‑site cross parking arrangement. Our current prototypes are adaptable to in‑line and end‑cap locations and/or spaces within an enclosed mall or a shopping center.  Our prototypical Bubba’s 33 restaurant remains under development as we continue to open additional restaurants.  We expect most future Bubba’s 33 restaurants to range between approximately 7,200 and 7,600 square feet depending on the location with seating for approximately 270 guests.

 As of December 25, 2018, we leased 348 properties and owned 143 properties. Our 2018 average unit volume for all Texas Roadhouse company restaurants open before June 27, 2017 was $5.2 million. The time required for a new Texas Roadhouse restaurant to reach a steady level of cash flow is approximately three to six months. For 2018, the average capital investment, including pre‑opening expenses and a capitalized rent factor, for the 23 Texas Roadhouse company restaurants opened during the year was approximately $5.2 million, broken down as follows:

 | Average Cost | | Low | | High 
Land(1) | $ | 1,330,000 | | $ | 600,000 | $ | 2,070,000
Building(2) | | 2,045,000 | | | 1,540,000 | | 2,920,000
Furniture and Equipment | | 1,195,000 | | | 1,110,000 | | 1,285,000
Pre-opening costs | | 600,000 | | | 445,000 | | 955,000 
Other(3) | | 30,000 | | | — | | 550,000 
Total | $ | 5,200,000 | | | | | 


(1) | Represents 10x’s initial base rent in the event the land is leased or the average cost for land acquisitions.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Includes site work costs.
----+--------------------------


(3) | Primarily liquor licensing costs, where applicable. This cost varies based on the licensing requirements in each state.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our average capital investment for the Texas Roadhouse restaurants opened in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $5.2 million, $5.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively. We expect our average capital investment for restaurants to be opened in 2019 to be approximately $5.5 million.  The increase in our estimated 2019 average capital investment is due to the purchase of land and the related site improvement costs at more locations.
 Our average capital investment for the Bubba’s 33 restaurants opened in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $7.1 million, $6.1 million and $6.5 million, respectively. The increase in our 2018 average capital investment for our Bubba’s 33 restaurants was primarily due to higher costs at one urban site in New Jersey as well as higher rent and pre-opening costs. Excluding this site, the average capital investment would have been $6.5 million.  We expect our average capital investment for restaurants to be opened in 2019 to be approximately $6.5 million.  We continue to evaluate our Bubba’s 33 prototypical asset design.  
  We remain focused on driving sales and managing restaurant investment costs in order to maintain our restaurant development in the future.  Our capital investment (including cash and non‑cash costs) for new restaurants varies significantly depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to: the square footage, layout, scope of required site work, type of construction labor (union or non‑union), local permitting requirements, our ability to negotiate with landowners and/or landlords, cost of liquor and other licenses and hook‑up fees and geographical location.
 Site Selection
 We continue to refine our site selection process. In analyzing each prospective site, our real estate team, as well as our restaurant market partners, devotes significant time and resources to the evaluation of local market demographics, population density, household income levels and site‑specific characteristics such as visibility, accessibility, traffic generators, proximity of other retail activities and competitors, traffic counts and parking. We work actively with experienced real estate brokers in target markets to select high quality sites and to maintain and regularly update our database of potential sites. We typically require three to six months to locate, approve and control a restaurant site and typically six to 12 additional months to obtain necessary permits. Upon receipt of permits, we require approximately four to five months to construct, equip and open a restaurant.

 Food
 Menu. Our restaurants offer a wide variety of menu items at attractive prices that are designed to appeal to a broad range of consumer tastes. At Texas Roadhouse restaurants, our dinner entrée prices generally range from $8.99 to $26.99. We offer a broad assortment of specially seasoned and aged steaks, all cooked over open grills and all but one hand‑cut daily on the premises. We also offer our guests a selection of ribs, seafood, chicken, pork chops, pulled pork and vegetable plates, and an assortment of hamburgers, salads and sandwiches. Entrée prices include unlimited peanuts, fresh baked yeast rolls and most include the choice of two made‑from‑scratch sides.  Other menu items include specialty appetizers such as the "Cactus Blossom®" and "Rattlesnake Bites®". We also provide a "12 & Under" menu for children that includes a selection of smaller-sized entrées served with one side item and a beverage at prices generally between $3.99 and $8.99. At Bubba’s 33 restaurants, our menu prices, excluding appetizers, generally range from $9.79 to $19.99.  We offer a broad assortment of wings, burgers, pizzas, salads and sandwiches.  In addition, we also offer our guests a selection of chicken, beef and seafood entrées.  Our Bubba’s 33 restaurants also offer an extensive selection of draft beer.  We provide a "12 & Under" menu for children at our Bubba’s 33 restaurants that includes a selection of items, including a beverage, at prices generally between $3.99 and $5.99.
 Most of our restaurants feature a full bar that offers an extensive selection of draft and bottled beer, major brands of liquor and wine as well as made in-house margaritas. Managing partners are encouraged to tailor their beer selection to include regional and local brands. Alcoholic beverages at our Texas Roadhouse restaurants accounted for 10.7% of restaurant sales in fiscal 2018.
 We strive to maintain a consistent menu at our restaurants over time. We continually review our menu to consider enhancements to existing menu items or the introduction of new items. We change our menu only after guest feedback and an extensive study of the operational and economic implications. To maintain our high levels of food quality and service, we generally remove one menu item for every new menu item introduced to facilitate our ability to execute high quality meals on a focused range of menu items.
 Food Quality and Safety. We are committed to serving a varied menu of high quality, great tasting food items with an emphasis on freshness. We have developed proprietary recipes to promote consistency in quality and taste throughout all restaurants and provide a unique flavor experience to our guests. At each domestic Texas Roadhouse restaurant, a trained meat cutter hand cuts our steaks and other restaurant employees prepare our side items and yeast rolls from scratch in the restaurants daily. At both Texas Roadhouse and Bubba’s 33 restaurants, we assign individual kitchen employees to the preparation of designated food items in order to focus on quality, consistency, speed and food safety. Additionally, we expect a management level employee to inspect every entrée before it leaves the kitchen to confirm it matches the guest’s order and meets our standards for quality, appearance and presentation.
 We employ a team of product coaches whose function is to provide continual, hands‑on training and education to the kitchen staff in our restaurants for the purpose of reinforcing food quality, recipe consistency, food preparation procedures, food safety and sanitation standards, food appearance, freshness and portion size. The product coach team supports substantially all restaurants system‑wide.
 Food safety is of utmost importance to us. We currently utilize several programs to help facilitate adherence to proper food preparation procedures and food safety standards including our daily taste and temperature procedures. We have a food team whose function, in conjunction with our product coaches, is to develop, enforce and maintain programs designed to promote compliance with food safety guidelines. As a requirement of our quality assurance process, primary food items purchased from qualified vendors have been inspected by reputable, outside inspection services confirming that the vendor is compliant with United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") guidelines.  
 We perform food safety and sanitation audits on our restaurants each year and these results are reviewed by various members of operations and management. To maximize adherence to food safety protocols, we have incorporated HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) principles and critical procedures (such as hand washing) in each recipe. In addition, most of our product coaches and food team members have obtained or are in the process of obtaining their Certified Professional-Food Safety designation from the National Environmental Health Association.
 Purchasing. Our purchasing philosophy is designed to supply fresh, quality products to the restaurants at competitive prices while maximizing operating efficiencies. We negotiate directly with suppliers for substantially all food and beverage products to maximize quality and freshness and obtain competitive prices.

 Food and supplies are ordered by and shipped directly to the domestic restaurants. Most food products used in the operation of our restaurants are distributed to individual restaurants through an independent national distribution company. We strive to qualify more than one supplier for all key food items and believe that beef of comparable quality as well as all other essential food and beverage products are available, upon short notice, from alternative qualified suppliers.
 Service
 Service Quality. We believe that guest satisfaction and our ability to continually evaluate and improve the guest experience at each of our restaurants is important to our success. We employ a team of service coaches whose function is to provide consistent, hands‑on training and education to our managers and service staff in our restaurants for the purpose of reinforcing service quality and consistency, staff attitude and team work and manage interaction in the dining room.  The service coach team supports substantially all restaurants system-wide.
 Guest Satisfaction. Through the use of guest surveys, our websites, "texasroadhouse.com" and "bubbas33.com," a toll‑free guest response telephone line, emails, letters, social media, and personal interaction in the restaurant, we receive valuable feedback from guests. Additionally, we employ an outside service to administer a "Secret Shopper" program whereby trained individuals periodically dine and comprehensively evaluate the guest experience at each of our domestic restaurants. Particular attention is given to food, beverage and service quality, cleanliness, staff attitude and teamwork, and manager visibility and interaction. The resulting reports are used for follow up training and providing feedback to both staff and management. We continue to evaluate and implement processes relating to guest satisfaction, including reducing guest wait times and improving host interaction with the guest. 
 Atmosphere. The atmosphere of our restaurants is intended to appeal to broad segments of the population including children, families, couples, adults and business persons. Substantially all Texas Roadhouse restaurants are of our prototype design, reflecting a rustic southwestern lodge atmosphere. The interiors feature pine and stained concrete floors and are decorated with hand‑painted murals, neon signs, southwestern prints, rugs and artifacts. The restaurants contain jukeboxes that continuously play upbeat country hits. Guests may also view a display‑baking area, where our fresh baked yeast rolls are prepared, and a meat cooler displaying fresh cut steaks. While waiting for a table, guests can enjoy complimentary roasted in‑shell peanuts and upon being seated at a table, guests can enjoy fresh baked yeast rolls along with roasted in‑shell peanuts.  Our Bubba’s 33 restaurants feature walls lined with televisions playing a variety of sports events and music videos and are decorated with sports jerseys, neon signs and other local flair.  
 People
 Management Personnel.   Each of our restaurants is generally staffed with one managing partner, one kitchen manager, one service manager and one or more additional assistant managers. Managing partners are single restaurant operators who have primary responsibility for the day‑to‑day operations of the entire restaurant.  Kitchen managers have primary responsibility for managing operations relating to our food preparation and food quality, and service managers have primary responsibility for managing our service quality and guest experiences.  The assistant managers support our kitchen and service managers; these managers are collectively responsible for the operations of the restaurant in the absence of a managing partner.  All managers are responsible for maintaining our standards of quality and performance. We use market partners to oversee the operation of our restaurants. Generally, each market partner may oversee as many as 8 to 15 managing partners and their respective management teams. Market partners are also responsible for the hiring and development of each restaurant’s management team and assisting in the site selection process.  Through regular visits to the restaurants, the market partners facilitate adherence to all aspects of our concepts, strategies and standards of quality. To further facilitate adherence to our standards of quality and to maximize uniform execution throughout the system, we employ product coaches and service coaches who regularly visit the restaurants to assist in training of both new and existing employees and to grade food and service quality. The attentive service and high quality food, which results from each restaurant having a managing partner, at least two to three managers and the hands‑on assistance of a product coach and a service coach, are critical to our success.
 Training and Development. All restaurant employees are required to complete varying degrees of training before and during employment. Our comprehensive training program emphasizes our operating strategy, procedures and standards and is conducted individually at our restaurants or in groups in Louisville, Kentucky.
 Our managing and market partners are generally required to have significant experience in the full‑service restaurant industry and are generally hired at a minimum of nine to 12 months before their placement in a new or 

 
  10

 
existing restaurant to allow time to fully train in all aspects of restaurant operations. All managing partners, kitchen and service managers and other management employees are required to complete an extensive training program of up to 20 weeks, which includes training for every position in the restaurant. Trainees are validated at pre‑determined points during their training by a market partner, managing partner, product coach and service coach.
 A number of our restaurants have been certified as training centers by our training department. This certification confirms that the training center adheres to established operating procedures and guidelines. Additionally, most restaurants are staffed with training coordinators responsible for ongoing daily training needs.
 For new restaurant openings, a full team of designated trainers, each specializing in a specific restaurant position, is deployed to the restaurant at least 10 days before opening. Formal employee training begins seven days before opening and follows a uniform, comprehensive training course as directed by a service coach.
 Marketing
 Our marketing strategy aims to promote our brands while retaining a localized focus. We strive to increase comparable restaurant sales by increasing the frequency of visits by our current guests and attracting new guests to our restaurants and also by communicating and promoting our brands’ food quality, the guest experience and value. We accomplish these objectives through three major initiatives.
 Local Restaurant Marketing. Given our strategy to be a neighborhood destination, local restaurant marketing is integral in developing brand awareness in each market. Managing partners are encouraged to participate in creative community‑based marketing. We also engage in a variety of promotional activities, such as contributing time, money and complimentary meals to charitable, civic and cultural programs. We employ marketing coordinators at the restaurant and market level to develop and execute the majority of the local marketing strategies.
 In‑restaurant Marketing. A significant portion of our marketing fund is spent communicating with our guests inside our restaurants through point of purchase materials. We believe special promotions such as Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day drive notable repeat business. Our eight‑week holiday gift card campaign is one of our most impactful promotions.
 Advertising. Our restaurants do not rely on national advertising to promote the brand. Earned media on a local level is a critical part of our strategy that features our products and people. Our restaurants use a permission‑based email loyalty program, as well as social media and digital marketing, to promote the brand and engage with our guests. Our approach to media aligns with our focus on local store marketing and community involvement.
 Restaurant Franchise Arrangements
 Franchise Restaurants. As of December 25, 2018, we had 25 franchisees that operated 91 Texas Roadhouse restaurants in 22 states and nine foreign countries. Domestically, franchise rights are granted for specific restaurants only, as we have not granted any rights to develop a territory in the United States.  We are currently not accepting new domestic franchisees.  Approximately 75% of our franchise restaurants are operated by nine franchisees and no franchisee operates more than 15 restaurants.
 Our standard domestic franchise agreement has a term of 10 years with two renewal options for an additional five years each if certain conditions are satisfied. Our current form of domestic franchise agreement generally requires the franchisee to pay a royalty fee of 4.0% of gross sales. We may, at our discretion, waive or reduce the royalty fee on a temporary or permanent basis. "Gross sales" means the total selling price of all services and products related to the restaurant. Gross sales do not include:

· | employee discounts or other discounts;
--+---------------------------------------


· | tips or gratuities paid directly to employees by guests;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | any federal, state, municipal or other sales, value added or retailer’s excise taxes; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adjustments for net returns on salable goods and discounts allowed to guests on sales.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Domestic franchisees are currently required to pay 0.3% of gross sales to a national marketing fund for system‑wide promotions and related marketing efforts. We have the ability under our agreements to increase the required marketing fund contribution up to 2.5% of gross sales. We may also charge a marketing fee of 0.5% of gross sales, which we may use for market research and to develop system‑wide promotional and marketing materials. A franchisee’s total required marketing contribution or spending will not be more than 3.0% of gross sales.
 Our standard domestic franchise agreement gives us the right, but not the obligation, to compel a franchisee to transfer its assets to us in exchange for shares of our stock, or to convert its equity interests into shares of our stock. The amount of shares that a franchisee would receive is based on a formula that is included in the franchise agreement.
 We have entered into area development and franchise agreements for the development and operation of Texas Roadhouse restaurants in several foreign countries.  We currently have signed franchise and/or development agreements in nine countries in the Middle East as well as Taiwan, the Philippines, Mexico, China and South Korea. As of December 25, 2018, we had 15 restaurants open in five countries in the Middle East, three restaurants open in Taiwan, two in the Philippines, one in Mexico and one in China for a total of 22 restaurants in nine foreign countries.  For the existing international agreements, the franchisee is required to pay us a franchise fee for each restaurant to be opened, royalties on the gross sales of each restaurant and a development fee for our grant of development rights in the named countries. We anticipate that the specific business terms of any future franchise agreement for international restaurants might vary significantly from the standard terms of our domestic agreements and from the terms of existing international agreements, depending on the territory to be franchised and the extent of franchisor‑provided services to each franchisee.
 Any of our franchise agreements, whether domestic or international, may be terminated if the franchisee defaults in the performance of any of its obligations under the development or franchise agreement, including its obligations to develop the territory or operate its restaurants in accordance with our standards and specifications. A franchise agreement may also be terminated if a franchisee becomes insolvent, fails to make its required payments, creates a threat to the public health or safety, ceases to operate the restaurant, or misuses the Texas Roadhouse trademarks.
 Franchise Compliance Assurance. We have various systems in place to promote compliance with our systems and standards, both during the development and operation of franchise restaurants. We actively work with our franchisees to support successful franchise operations as well as compliance with the Texas Roadhouse standards and procedures. During the restaurant development phase, we consent to the selection of restaurant sites and make available copies of our prototype building plans to franchisees. In addition, we ensure that the building design is in compliance with our standards. We provide training to the managing partner and up to three other managers of a franchisee’s first restaurant. We also provide trainers to assist in the opening of every domestic franchise restaurant; we provide trainers to assist our international franchisees in the opening of their restaurants until such time as they develop an approved restaurant opening training program. Finally, on an ongoing basis, we conduct reviews on all franchise restaurants to determine their level of effectiveness in executing our concept at a variety of operational levels. Our franchisees are required to follow the same standards and procedures regarding equipment and food purchases, preparation and safety procedures as we maintain in our company restaurants. Reviews are conducted by seasoned operations teams and focus on key areas including health, safety and execution proficiency.
 Management Services. We provide management services to 24 of the franchise restaurants in which we and/or our executive officers have an ownership interest and six additional franchise restaurants in which neither we nor our founder have an ownership interest. Such management services include accounting, operational supervision, human resources, training, and food, beverage and equipment consulting for which we receive monthly fees of up to 2.5% of gross sales. We also make available to these restaurants certain legal services, restaurant employees and employee benefits on a pass‑through cost basis. We receive a monthly fee from eight franchise restaurants in which we have an ownership interest and 16 franchise restaurants in which neither we nor our founder have an ownership interest for providing payroll and accounting services.
 Information Technology
 All of our company restaurants utilize computerized management information systems, which are designed to improve operating efficiencies, provide restaurant and Support Center management with timely access to financial and operating data and reduce administrative time and expense. With our current information systems, we have the ability to query, report and analyze this intelligent data on a daily, weekly, period, quarterly and year‑to‑date basis and beyond, on a company‑wide, regional or individual restaurant basis. Together, this enables us to closely monitor sales, food and beverage costs and labor and operating expenses at each of our restaurants. We have a number of systems and reports 

 
  12

 
that provide comparative information that enables both restaurant and Support Center management to supervise the financial and operational performance of our restaurants and to recognize and understand trends in the business. Our accounting department uses a standard, integrated system to prepare monthly profit and loss statements, which provides a detailed analysis of sales and costs. These monthly profit and loss statements are compared both to the restaurant‑prepared reports and to prior periods. Restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurants is provided and coordinated from the restaurant Support Center in Louisville, Kentucky. Currently, we utilize cable, digital subscriber lines (DSL) or T‑1 technology at the restaurant level, which serves as a high‑speed, secure communication link between the restaurants and our Support Center as well as our credit and gift card processors. We guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan, which includes storing critical business information off‑site, maintaining a redundant data center, testing the disaster recovery plan and providing on‑site power backup.
 We accept credit cards and gift cards as payment at our restaurants. We have systems and processes in place that focus on the protection of our guests’ credit card information and other private information that we are required to protect, such as our employees’ personal information. Our systems have been carefully designed and configured to safeguard against data loss or compromise. We submit our systems to regular audit and review, including the requirements of Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. We also periodically scan our networks to assess vulnerability.  See Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K for a discussion of risks associated with breaches of security related to confidential guest and/or employee information.
 We believe that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth. Information systems projects are prioritized based on strategic, financial, regulatory and other business advantage criteria.
 Competition
 Competition in the restaurant industry is intense. We compete with well-established food service companies on the basis of taste, quality and price of the food offered, service, atmosphere, location, take-out and delivery options and overall dining experience. Our competitors include a large and diverse group of restaurant chains and individual restaurants that range from independent local operators that have opened restaurants in various markets to well‑capitalized national restaurant companies. We also face competition from meal kit delivery services as well as the supermarket industry. In addition, improving product offerings of fast casual and quick‑service restaurants, together with negative economic conditions could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives. Although we believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of the above factors, other restaurants and retail establishments compete for the same casual dining guests, quality site locations and restaurant‑level employees as we do. We expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas. Trademarks
 Our registered trademarks and service marks include, among others, our trade names and our logo and proprietary rights related to certain core menu offerings. We have registered all of our significant marks for our restaurants with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have registered or have registrations pending for our most significant trademarks and service marks in 50 foreign jurisdictions. To better protect our brand, we have also registered various Internet domain names. We believe that our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brand‑building efforts and the marketing of our restaurant concepts. Government Regulation
 We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws affecting our business.  For a discussion of the risks and potential impact on our business of a failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations, see Item 1A, Risk Factors.
     Each of our restaurants is subject to permitting and licensing requirements and regulations by a number of government authorities, which may include, among others, alcoholic beverage control, health and safety, sanitation, labor, zoning and public safety agencies in the state and/or municipality in which each restaurant is located.  The development and operation of restaurants depends on selecting and acquiring suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations.  In addition to domestic regulations, our international business exposes us to additional regulations, including antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott legislation, import/export and customs regulations and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

     We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling.  We are or may become subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie, fat, trans-fat, salt and allergen content.  On May 7, 2018, new federal regulations went into effect under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 ("PPACA") requiring new menu nutritional labeling requirements.  This new federal law supersedes previous food and menu nutritional labeling requirements adopted by state and local jurisdictions.  However, future regulatory action may occur as a result of the current political environment which could result in changes in the federal nutritional disclosure requirements.
     In 2018, the sale of alcoholic beverages accounted for 10.7% of our Texas Roadhouse restaurant sales.  In order to serve alcoholic beverages in our restaurants, we must comply with alcoholic beverage control regulations which require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority, and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities, for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises.  These licenses or permits must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time.  Alcoholic beverage control regulations affect numerous aspects of restaurant operations, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, training, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.  State and local authorities in many jurisdictions routinely monitor compliance with alcoholic beverage laws.  The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses or permits would have a material adverse effect on the restaurant’s operations.  We are also subject in certain states to "dram shop" statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person.  Consistent with industry standards, we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance as well as excess umbrella coverage.
     Our restaurant operations are also subject to federal and state labor laws governing such matters as minimum and tipped wage requirements, overtime pay, health benefits, unemployment taxes, workers’ compensation, work eligibility requirements, working conditions, safety standards, and hiring and employment practices.  We have many restaurants located in states or municipalities where the minimum and/or tipped wage is greater than the federal minimum and/or tipped wage.  In 2016, the Department of Labor published changes related to the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA") which resulted in changes to the threshold for overtime pay.  The changes were scheduled to go into effect on December 1, 2016, however, in late November 2016, a federal judge blocked the implementation.  Despite the injunction, we implemented the changes to our overtime policies as originally planned.  We have implemented the provisions of the PPACA as it relates to health care reform and related rules and regulations and continue to monitor the impact of this law on our business. We anticipate that additional legislation increasing minimum and/or tipped wage standards will be enacted in future periods and in other jurisdictions.  Further regulatory action may occur as a result of the current political environment which could result in changes to healthcare eligibility, design and cost structure. 
     A significant number of our hourly restaurant personnel receive tips as part of their compensation and are paid at or above a minimum wage rate after giving effect to applicable tips.  We rely on our employees to accurately disclose the full amount of their tip income.  We base our FICA tax reporting on the disclosures provided to us by such tipped employees.
     Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA") and related state accessibility statutes.  Under the ADA and related state laws, we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment.  In addition, when constructing or undertaking remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible.
     We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud.  An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information.
     Seasonality
 Our business is also subject to minor seasonal fluctuations. Historically, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the winter months of each year. Holidays, changes in weather, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. As a result, our quarterly operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate as a result of seasonality. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily

indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease.
 Employees
 As of December 25, 2018, we employed approximately 64,900 people. This amount includes 648 executive and administrative personnel and 2,361 restaurant management personnel, while the remainder were hourly restaurant personnel. Many of our hourly restaurant employees work part‑time. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
