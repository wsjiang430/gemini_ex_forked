Item 1. | BUSINESS

Our Company
Mueller Water Products, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on September 22, 2005 under the name Mueller Holding Company, Inc. On June 1, 2006, we completed an initial public offering of 28,750,000 shares of our common stock, and on December 14, 2006, Walter Industries, Inc., our parent company at that time, distributed to its shareholders 85,844,920 shares of our common stock to complete a spin-off of the Company.
On September 23, 2009, we completed a public offering of 37,122,000 shares of common stock.
On April 1, 2012, we sold U.S. Pipe.
On January 6, 2017, we sold Anvil. Anvil’s results of operations and the gain from its sale have been classified as discontinued operations.
We are a leading manufacturer and marketer of products and services used in the transmission, distribution and measurement of water in North America. Our products and services are used by municipalities and the residential and non-residential construction industries. Certain of our products have leading positions due to their strong brand recognition and reputation for quality, service and innovation. We believe we have one of the largest installed bases of iron gate valves and fire hydrants in the United States. Our iron gate valve or fire hydrant products are specified for use in the largest 100 metropolitan areas in the United States. Our large installed base, broad product range and well-known brands have led to long-standing relationships with the key distributors and end users of our products. Our consolidated net sales were $968.0 million in 2019. 
We operate our business through two segments, Infrastructure, formerly referred to as Mueller Co., and Technologies, formerly referred to as Mueller Technologies. Segment sales, operating results and additional financial data and commentary are provided in the Segment Analysis section in Part II, Item 7. “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” and in Note 16. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” of this annual report.
Infrastructure
Infrastructure manufactures valves for water and gas systems, including iron gate, butterfly, tapping, check, knife, plug, automatic control and ball valves, as well as dry-barrel and wet-barrel fire hydrants and a broad line of pipe repair products, such as clamps and couplings used to repair leaks. Infrastructure’s net sales were $871.0 million in 2019. Sales of Infrastructure products are driven principally by spending on water and wastewater infrastructure upgrade, repair and replacement, and by construction of new water and wastewater infrastructure, which is typically associated with construction of new residential communities. Infrastructure sells its products primarily through waterworks distributors. We believe a majority of Infrastructure’s 2019 net sales were for infrastructure upgrade, repair and replacement. Infrastructure also sells products for pipe repair to natural gas utilities.
Technologies
 Technologies offers residential and commercial water metering, water leak detection and pipe condition assessment products, systems and services. Technologies’ net sales were $97.0 million in 2019. Technologies is comprised of the Mueller Systems and Echologics businesses. Mueller Systems sells water metering systems, products and services directly to municipalities and to waterworks distributors. Echologics sells water leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services primarily to municipalities.

Business Strategy
Our business strategy is to capitalize on the large, attractive and growing water infrastructure markets worldwide. Key elements of this strategy are as follows:
Accelerate development of new products.
We plan to continue to increase investments in our product development capabilities, including expanding our engineering staff, to develop and market new products and services. We expect to add new products to our portfolio and offer new products into different end markets. We expect this expansion to come through internal investments as well as acquisitions. 
Develop a fully-integrated technology platform for infrastructure monitoring.
 We have introduced a new software platform, Sentryx™, that provides data intelligence to help water utilities make strategic and operational decisions. As our customers seek to use real-time data and analytics to manage and repair their aging infrastructures more efficiently, we believe we are uniquely positioned to help solve their problems given our expertise and the large installed base of our products. This data includes leak detection, pressure monitoring, advanced metering and water quality, which are aggregated and consolidated within the Sentryx™ platform, providing utilities with critical information regarding their distribution systems.
Drive operational excellence.
We are bringing best practices focused on Lean manufacturing with an investment mindset to deliver manufacturing productivity improvements. We expect these efforts will facilitate innovation and new product development, helping us drive sales growth and improve product margins. Productivity improvements at our facilities should allow us to drive down costs, which can fund additional manufacturing initiatives and continued investment in product development.
Modernize manufacturing facilities.
  We are prioritizing capital investments through 2022 to modernize our manufacturing facilities and processes. We believe this modernization will improve product quality, drive non-price margin expansion and expand our product portfolio. We expect our large valve manufacturing expansion in Chattanooga will begin full-scale production in 2020, and at the end of 2019 we acquired a property in Kimball, Tennessee to further expand our capabilities in the Chattanooga area and allow us to insource more products and operations. We expect these investments will allow us to capitalize on the growing need for large valves due to the migration to more densely populated, urban areas and an increased focus by customers on products made in America. In addition, we have begun construction of a new brass foundry in Decatur, Illinois.
Continue to seek to acquire and invest in businesses and technologies that expand our existing portfolio of businesses or allow us to enter new markets.
We will continue to evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses, technologies and product lines that have the potential to strengthen our competitive positions, enhance or expand our existing product and service offerings, expand our technological capabilities, provide synergistic opportunities or allow us to enter new markets.  As part of this strategy, we may pursue international opportunities, including acquisitions, joint ventures and partnerships, that allow us to expand product or service offerings or enter new markets.
Description of Products and Services
We offer a broad line of water infrastructure, flow control, metrology and leak detection products and services primarily in the United States and Canada. Infrastructure sells water and gas valves, fire hydrants and pipe repair products. Technologies sells water metering products and systems and leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services. Our products are designed, manufactured and tested in compliance with industry standards, where applicable.
Infrastructure
Infrastructure is comprised of companies that manufacture valves for water and gas systems, as well as fire hydrants and pipe repair products for water distribution.
Infrastructure’s water distribution products are manufactured to meet or exceed American Water Works Association (“AWWA”) Standards and, where applicable, certified to NSF/ANSI Standard 61 for potable water conveyance. In addition, Underwriters Laboratory (“UL”) and FM Approvals (“FM”) have approved many of these products. These products are typically specified by a water utility for use in its system.

Water and Gas Valves and Related Products.  Infrastructure manufactures valves for water and gas systems, including iron gate, butterfly, tapping, check, knife, plug, automatic control and ball valves, and sells these products under a variety of brand names, including Mueller, Pratt, U.S. Pipe Valve and Hydrant, and Singer Valve. Water and gas valves and related products, generally made of iron or brass, accounted for $576.4 million, $569.1 million and $516.9 million of our gross sales in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These valve products are used to control distribution and transmission of potable water, non-potable water or gas. Water valve products typically range in size from ¾ inch to 36 inches in diameter. Infrastructure also manufactures significantly larger valves as custom order work through its Henry Pratt product line. Most of these valves are used in water transmission or distribution, water treatment facilities or industrial applications.
Infrastructure also produces machines and tools for tapping, drilling, extracting, installing and stopping-off, which are designed to work with its water and gas fittings and valves as an integrated system.
Fire Hydrants.  Infrastructure manufactures dry-barrel and wet-barrel fire hydrants. Sales of fire hydrants and fire hydrant parts accounted for $199.7 million, $204.3 million and $186.5 million of our gross sales in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Infrastructure sells fire hydrants for new water infrastructure development, fire protection systems and water infrastructure repair and replacement projects.
These fire hydrants consist of an upper barrel and nozzle section and a lower barrel and valve section that connects to a water main. In dry-barrel hydrants, the valve connecting the barrel of the hydrant to the water main is located below ground at or below the frost line, which keeps the upper barrel dry. Infrastructure sells dry-barrel fire hydrants under the Mueller and U.S. Pipe Valve and Hydrant brand names in the United States and the Canada Valve brand name in Canada. Infrastructure also makes wet-barrel hydrants, where the valves are located in the hydrant nozzles and the barrel contains water at all times. Wet-barrel hydrants are made for warm weather climates, such as in California and Hawaii, and are sold under the Jones brand name.
Most municipalities have approved a limited number of fire hydrant brands for installation within their systems due to their desires to use the same tools and operating instructions across their systems and to minimize inventories of spare parts. We believe Infrastructure’s large installed base of fire hydrants throughout the United States and Canada, reputation for superior quality and performance and incumbent specification positions have contributed to the leading market position of its fire hydrants. This large installed base also leads to recurring sales of replacement hydrants and hydrant parts.
 Other Products and Services. Infrastructure also sells pipe repair products, such as couplings, grips and clamps used to repair leaks, under the Hymax, Mueller, and Krausz brand names.
Technologies
Technologies is comprised of companies that provide innovative solutions, products and services that actively diagnose, measure and monitor the delivery of water.
Water Metering Products and Systems. Mueller Systems manufactures and sources a variety of water technology products under the Mueller Systems and Hersey brand names that are designed to help water providers accurately measure and control water usage. Mueller Systems offers a complete line of residential, fire line and commercial metering solutions. Residential and commercial water meters are generally classified as either manually read meters or remotely read meters via radio technology. A manually read meter consists of a water meter and a register that gives a visual meter reading display. Meters equipped with radio transmitters (endpoints) use encoder registers to convert the measurement data from the meter (mechanical or static) into an encrypted digital format which is then transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility billing systems. These remotely read systems are either automatic meter reading (“AMR”) systems or fixed network advanced metering infrastructure (“AMI”) systems. With an AMR system, utility personnel with mobile equipment, including a radio receiver, computer and reading software, collect the data from utilities’ meters. With an AMI system, a network of permanent data collectors or gateway receivers that are always active or listening for the radio transmission from the utilities’ meters gather the data. AMI systems eliminate the need for utility personnel to travel through service territories to collect meter reading data. These systems provide the utilities with more frequent and diverse data at specified intervals from the utilities’ meters and allow for two-way communication. Mueller Systems sells both AMR and AMI systems and related products. Mueller Systems’ remote disconnect water meter enables the water flow to be stopped and started remotely via handheld devices or from a central operating facility.
Sales of water metering products and systems accounted for 81%, 79% and 83% of Technologies’ net sales in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Water Leak Detection and Pipe Condition Assessment Products and Services. Echologics develops technologies and offers products and services under the Echologics brand name that can non-invasively (without disrupting service or introducing a foreign object into the water system) detect underground leaks and assess the condition of water mains comprised of a variety of materials.  Echologics leverages its proprietary acoustic technology to offer leak detection and condition assessment surveys. Echologics also offers fixed leak detection systems that allow customers to continuously monitor and detect leaks on water distribution and transmission mains. We believe Echologics’ ability to offer leak detection and pipe condition assessment services non-invasively is a key competitive advantage.
Manufacturing
See “Item 2. PROPERTIES” for a description of our principal manufacturing facilities. 
We will continue to expand the use of Lean manufacturing and Six Sigma business improvement methodologies where appropriate to safely capture higher levels of quality, service and operational efficiency in our manufacturing facilities in both segments. 
Infrastructure
Infrastructure operates thirteen manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Canada, Israel and China. These manufacturing operations include foundry, machining, fabrication, assembly, testing and painting operations. Not all facilities perform each of these operations. Infrastructure’s existing manufacturing capacity is sufficient for anticipated near-term requirements. However, in order to meet longer-term capacity requirements and modernize some production facilities, Infrastructure is currently expanding its large valve casting capabilities at its foundry location in Chattanooga, Tennessee has acquired a property in nearby Kimball, Tennessee to insource certain activities and assemble certain large valves, and has announced plans to build a new brass foundry in Decatur, Illinois that will replace our existing foundry there upon completion. 
Infrastructure foundries use both lost foam and green sand casting techniques. Infrastructure uses the lost foam technique for fire hydrant production in its Albertville, Alabama facility and for iron gate valve production in its Chattanooga, Tennessee facility. The lost foam technique has several advantages over the green sand technique for high-volume products, including a reduction in the number of manual finishing operations, lower scrap levels and the ability to reuse some of the materials.
Technologies
Technologies operates one manufacturing facility in the United States and contracts with a manufacturing facility in Mexico. Certain Technologies products are also manufactured in facilities primarily dedicated to Infrastructure products. Technologies designs, manufactures and assembles water metering products in Cleveland, North Carolina, designs and supports AMR and AMI systems in our research and development center of excellence for software and electronics in Atlanta, Georgia, and designs leak detection and condition assessment products in Toronto, Ontario.
Purchased Components and Raw Materials
Our products are made using various purchased components and several basic raw materials, including brass ingot, scrap steel, sand and resin. Purchased parts and raw materials represented approximately 38% and 10%, respectively, of cost of sales in 2019.
Patents, Licenses and Trademarks
We have active patents relating to the design of our products and trademarks for our brands and products. We have filed and continue to file, when appropriate, patent applications used in connection with our business and products. Many of the patents for technology underlying the majority of our products have been in the public domain for many years, and we do not believe third-party patents individually or in the aggregate are material to our business. However, we consider the pool of proprietary information, consisting of expertise and trade secrets relating to the design, manufacture and operation of our products to be particularly important and valuable. We generally own the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell, and we are not dependent in any material way upon any license or franchise to operate. See “Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Any inability to protect our intellectual property or our failure to effectively defend against intellectual property infringement claims could adversely affect our competitive position.”

Seasonality
See “Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Seasonal demand for certain of our products and services may adversely affect our financial results.” and “Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Seasonality.”
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
We sell primarily to distributors. Our distributor relationships are generally non-exclusive, but we attempt to align ourselves with key distributors in the principal markets we serve. We believe “Mueller” is the most recognized brand in the U.S. water infrastructure industry.
Infrastructure
Infrastructure sells its products primarily through waterworks distributors to a wide variety of end user customers, including municipalities, water and wastewater utilities, gas utilities, and fire protection and construction contractors. Sales of our products are heavily influenced by the specifications for the underlying projects. Approximately 8%, 9% and 8% of Infrastructure’s net sales were to Canadian customers in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
At September 30, 2019, Infrastructure had 78 sales representatives in the field and 112 inside marketing and sales professionals, as well as 128 independent manufacturer’s representatives. In addition to calling on distributors, these representatives call on municipalities, water companies and other end users to ensure the products specified for their projects are our products or comparable to our products.
Infrastructure’s extensive installed base, broad product range and well-known brands have led to many long-standing relationships with the key distributors in the principal markets we serve. Our distribution network covers all of the major locations for our principal products in the United States and Canada. Although we have long-standing relationships with most of our key distributors, we typically do not have long-term contracts with them, including our two largest distributors, which together accounted for approximately 34%, 35% and 34% of Infrastructure’s gross sales in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The loss of either of these distributors would have a material adverse effect on our business. See “Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Our business depends on a small group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales.”
Technologies
Technologies sells its water metering systems, products and services directly to municipalities and to waterworks distributors and sells water leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services primarily to municipalities and to utilities. At September 30, 2019, Technologies had 33 sales representatives in the field. Technologies’ five largest customers accounted for approximately 50%, 47% and 48% of its gross sales in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See “Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Our business depends on a small group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales.”

Backlog
We consider backlog to represent orders placed by customers for which goods or services have yet to be delivered. Backlog is a meaningful indicator for the Pratt product line of Infrastructure and the Mueller Systems business unit of Technologies. Pratt products consist of valves and other parts for large projects that typically require design and build specifications. The delivery lead time for parts used for these projects can be as long as nine months, and we expect approximately 15% of Pratt’s backlog at the end of 2019 will not be shipped until beyond 2020. Mueller Systems manufactures or sources water meter systems that are sometimes ordered in large quantities with delivery dates over several years, and we expect approximately 2% of Mueller Systems’ backlog will not be shipped until beyond 2020. Backlogs for Pratt and Mueller Systems are presented below.

 | September 30,
 | 2019 | | 2018
 | (in millions)
Pratt | $ | 81.6 | | | $ | 71.9
Mueller Systems | 8.9 | | | 20.6 | 

Sales cycles for metering systems can span several years and it is common for customers to place orders throughout the contract period. Although we believe we have a common understanding with our customer as to the total value of a contract when it is awarded, we do not recognize backlog until customer orders are received. 
Competition
The U.S. and Canadian markets for water infrastructure and flow control products are very competitive. See “Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our operating results.” There are only a few competitors for most of our product and service offerings. Many of our competitors are well-established companies with products that have strong brand recognition. We consider our installed base, product quality, customer service level, brand recognition, innovation, distribution and technical support to be competitive strengths.
The competitive environment for most of Infrastructure’s valve and hydrant products is mature and many end users are slow to transition to brands other than their historically preferred brand. It is difficult to increase market share in this environment. We believe our fire hydrants and valves enjoy strong competitive positions based primarily on the extent of their installed base, product quality, specified position and brand recognition. Our principal competitors for fire hydrants and iron gate valves are McWane, Inc. and American Cast Iron Pipe Company. The primary competitors for our brass products are The Ford Meter Box Company, Inc. and A.Y. McDonald Mfg. Co. Many brass valves are interchangeable among different manufacturers. With respect to our specialty valve products such as butterfly, plug, and check valves, our principal competitors are mainly DeZURIK, Val-Matic and McWane, Inc.
The markets for products and services sold by Technologies are very competitive. Mueller Systems sells water metering products and systems, primarily in the United States. We believe a substantial portion of this market is in the process of transitioning from manually read meters to automatically read meters, but we also expect this transition to be relatively slow and that many end users will be reluctant to adopt brands other than their historically preferred brand. Although Mueller Systems’ market position is relatively small, we believe our automatically read meters and associated technology are well positioned to gain a greater share of these markets. Our principal competitors are Sensus, Itron, Inc., Neptune Technology Group Inc., Badger Meter, Inc., and Master Meter, Inc. Echologics sells water leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services in North America, the United Kingdom and select countries in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, with our primary markets being the United States and Canada. The worldwide market for leak detection and pipe condition assessment is highly fragmented with numerous competitors. Our more significant competitors are Pure Technologies Ltd., Gutermann AG and Syrinix Ltd.
Research and Development
Our primary research and development (“R&D”) facilities are located in Chattanooga, Tennessee and Tel Aviv, Israel for Infrastructure and in Atlanta, Georgia and Toronto, Ontario for Technologies. The primary focus of these operations is to develop new products, improve and refine existing products and obtain and assure compliance with industry approval certifications or standards (such as AWWA, UL, FM, NSF and The Public Health and Safety Company). At September 30, 2019, we employed 84 people dedicated to R&D activities.  R&D expenses were $14.3 million, $11.6 million and $12.1 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Regulatory and Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the United States, in areas such as: competition, government contracts, international trade, labor and employment, tax, licensing, consumer protection, environmental protection, workplace health and safety, and others. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business, and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our operations, both favorably and unfavorably. For example, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar state laws affect our operations by, among other things, imposing investigation and cleanup requirements for threatened or actual releases of hazardous substances. Under CERCLA, joint and several liability may be imposed on operators, generators, site owners, lessees and others regardless of fault or the legality of the original activity that caused or resulted in the release of the hazardous substances. Thus, we may be subject to liability under CERCLA and similar state laws for properties that (1) we currently own, lease or operate, (2) we, our predecessors, or former subsidiaries previously owned, leased or operated, (3) sites to which we, our predecessors or former subsidiaries sent waste materials, and (4) sites at which hazardous substances from our facilities’ operations have otherwise come to be located. The purchaser of U.S. Pipe has been identified as a “potentially responsible party” (“PRP”) under CERCLA in connection with a former manufacturing facility operated by U.S. Pipe that was in the vicinity of a Superfund site located in North Birmingham, Alabama. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement relating to our sale of U.S. Pipe, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain environmental liabilities, including those arising out of the former manufacturing site in North Birmingham. Accordingly, the purchaser tendered the matter to us for indemnification, which we accepted. Ultimate liability for the site will depend on many factors that have not yet been determined, including the determination of EPA’s remediation costs, the number and financial viability of the other PRPs (there are four other PRPs currently) and the determination of the final allocation of the costs among the PRPs. For more information regarding this matter as well as others that may affect our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, see “Item 1A. RISK FACTORS,” “Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS - Environmental,” “Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Contingencies” and Note 17. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Employees
At September 30, 2019, we employed approximately 3,100 people, of whom 81% work in the United States. At September 30, 2019, 65% of our hourly workforce was represented by collective bargaining agreements.
Our locations with employees covered by such agreements are presented below.

Location | Expiration of current agreement(s) 
Chattanooga, TN | November 2019, January 2020 and October 2021
Decatur, IL | June 2020 
Albertville, AL | October 2020 
Aurora, IL | September 2021 

We believe relations with our employees, including those represented by collective bargaining agreements, are good.
