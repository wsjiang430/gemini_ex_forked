ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Organizational History and Subsidiaries
 
Ohio Valley Banc Corp. (“Ohio Valley” or the “Company”) is an Ohio corporation registered as a financial holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”).  Ohio Valley was incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio on January 8, 1992 and began conducting business on October 23, 1992.  The principal executive offices of Ohio Valley are located at 420 Third Avenue, Gallipolis, Ohio 45631.  Ohio Valley’s common shares are listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “OVBC.”  Ohio Valley has one banking subsidiary, The Ohio Valley Bank Company (the “Bank”).  The Bank has one wholly-owned subsidiary, Ohio Valley REO, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company (“Ohio Valley REO”), to which the Bank transfers certain real estate acquired by the Bank through foreclosure for sale by Ohio Valley REO. Ohio Valley also owns three nonbank subsidiaries, Loan Central, Inc., which engages in lending (“Loan Central”), Ohio Valley Financial Services Agency, LLC, which is used to facilitate the receipt of commissions on insurance sold by the Bank and Loan Central (“Ohio Valley Financial Services”), and OVBC Captive, Inc., a limited purpose property and casualty insurance company (“OVBC Captive”).  Ohio Valley also owns one wholly-owned subsidiary trust formed solely to issue a trust preferred security.   Ohio Valley and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Company.” Ohio Valley’s financial service operations are considered by management to be aggregated in two reportable segments:  banking and consumer finance.

Business of Bank Subsidiary
 
A substantial portion of Ohio Valley’s revenue is derived from cash dividends paid by the Bank.   The Bank presently has nineteen offices located in Ohio and West Virginia, all but two offering automatic teller machines (“ATMs”).  Twelve of these offices also offer drive-up services.  The Bank accounted for substantially all of Ohio Valley’s consolidated assets at December 31, 2018.
 
The Bank is primarily engaged in commercial and retail banking.  The Bank is a full-service financial institution offering a blend of commercial and consumer banking services within southeastern Ohio as well as western West Virginia.  The banking services offered by the Bank include the acceptance of deposits in checking, savings, time and money market accounts; the making and servicing of personal, commercial, floor plan and student loans; and the making of construction and real estate loans.

In addition to originating loans, the Bank invests in U.S. government and agency obligations, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, and other investments permitted by applicable law.
 
The Bank began offering trust services in 1981.   The trust department acts as trustee under wills, trusts and profit sharing plans, as executor and administrator of estates, and as guardian for estates of minors and incompetents.  In addition, the trust department performs a variety of investment and security services where the Bank acts as an agent on behalf of the client.

Financial Information
 
 Financial information regarding the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and results of operations for the last three fiscal years is contained in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Business Combinations
 
As of the close of business on August 5, 2016, Ohio Valley completed its merger with Milton Bancorp, Inc. (“Milton Bancorp”) pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of January 7, 2016, by and between Ohio Valley and Milton Bancorp, as amended (the “Merger Agreement”).  Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Milton Bancorp was merged with and into Ohio Valley.  Immediately following the Merger, The Milton Banking Company (“Milton Bank”) was merged with and into the Bank.  The consideration paid for Milton Bancorp totaled $18.875 million, of which $11.444 million was the market value of the Company’s common shares and $7.431 million was cash.  The fair value of the common shares issued as part of the consideration paid for Milton Bancorp was determined on the basis of the closing price of the Company’s common shares on the acquisition date.  After the merger, the Company’s assets totaled approximately $950 million and branches increased to 19 locations.  Further detail on the merger is located in Ohio Valley’s 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders under “Note B – Business Combinations” in the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Lending Activities
 
The Company’s loan portfolio increased $7,733,000 to finish at $777,052,000 in 2018.  The increase in total loans was primarily due to growth within the Company’s Athens, Ohio and West Virginia locations.  The loan portfolio is comprised of commercial (commercial real estate and commercial and industrial), residential real estate and consumer loans, including credit card and home equity loans.  During 2018, residential real estate loans decreased $5,084,000, or 1.6%, while commercial loans increased $9,068,000, or 2.8%, and consumer loans increased $3,749,000, or 2.7%, as compared to 2017.  Consolidated interest and fee revenue from loans accounted for 76.31%, 76.50%, and 76.21% of total consolidated revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The Company’s market area for lending is primarily located in southeastern Ohio and portions of western West Virginia.  The Company believes that there is no significant concentration of loans to borrowers engaged in the same or similar industries and does not have any loans to foreign entities.
Residential Real Estate Loans
 
The Company’s residential real estate loans consist primarily of one- to four-family residential mortgages and carry many of the same customer and industry risks as the commercial loan portfolio.  Real estate loans to consumers are secured primarily by a first lien mortgage or deed of trust  with evidence of title in favor of the Bank.  The Company also requires proof of hazard insurance, required at the time of closing, with the Bank or Loan Central named as the mortgagee and as loss payee.  The Company generally requires the amount of a residential real estate loan be no more than 80% of the purchase price or the appraisal value (whichever is the lesser) of the real estate securing the loan, unless private mortgage insurance is obtained by the borrower for the percentage exceeding 80%.  These loans generally range from one-year adjustable to thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages.  The Company’s market area for real estate lending is primarily located in southeastern Ohio and portions of western West Virginia.  The Bank continues to sell a portion of its new fixed-rate real estate loan originations to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) to enhance customer service and loan pricing.  Secondary market sales of these real estate loans, which have fixed rates with fifteen- to thirty-year terms, have assisted in meeting the consumer preference for long-term fixed-rate loans as well as minimized the Bank’s exposure to interest rate risk.

Commercial Loans
 
The Company’s commercial loan portfolio consists of loans to corporate borrowers primarily in small to mid-sized industrial and commercial companies that include service, retail and wholesale merchants.  Collateral securing these loans includes equipment, inventory, stock, commercial real estate and rental property.  Commercial loans are considered to have a higher level of risk compared to other types of loans (i.e., single-family residential mortgages, installment loans and credit card loans), although care is taken to minimize these risks.  Numerous risk factors impact this portfolio, such as the economy, new technology, labor rates, cash flow, financial structure and asset quality.  The payment experience on commercial loans is dependent on adequate cash flows from the business to service both interest and principal due.  Thus, commercial loans may be more sensitive to adverse conditions in the economy generally or adverse conditions in a specific industry.  The Company diversifies risk within this portfolio by closely monitoring industry concentrations and portfolios to ensure that it does not exceed established lending guidelines.  Underwriting standards require a comprehensive credit analysis and independent evaluation of virtually all larger balance commercial loans prior to approval. The Bank’s loan committee will review and approve all new commercial loan originations that exceed the originating loan officer’s lending limits according to the following thresholds:  up to $750,000 unsecured, up to $3,000,000 secured, and up to $3,000,000 aggregate.  The  Executive Committee of the Bank’s Board of Directors will review and approve all new commercial loan originations up to the legal lending limit of the Bank.
Consumer Loans
 
Consumer loans are secured by automobiles, mobile homes, recreational vehicles and other personal property.  Personal loans and unsecured credit card receivables are also included as consumer loans.  The Company makes installment credit available to customers in their primary market area of southeastern Ohio and portions of western West Virginia.  Credit approval for consumer loans requires demonstration of sufficient income to repay principal and interest due, stability of employment, a positive credit record and sufficient collateral for secured loans.  The Company monitors the risk associated with these types of loans by monitoring factors such as portfolio growth, lending policies and economic conditions.  Underwriting standards are continually evaluated and modified based upon these factors.  A qualified compliance officer is responsible for monitoring the performance of his or her respective consumer portfolio and updating loan personnel.  The Company makes credit life insurance and health and accident insurance available to all qualified borrowers, thus reducing their risk of loss when their income is terminated or interrupted.  The Company reviews its respective consumer loan portfolios monthly to charge off loans which do not meet applicable standards.  Credit card accounts are administered in accordance with the same standards as those applied to other consumer loans.  Consumer loans generally involve more risk as to collectibility than mortgage loans because of the type and nature of collateral and, in certain instances, the absence of collateral.  As a result, consumer lending collections are dependent upon the borrower’s continued financial stability and are adversely affected by job loss, divorce or personal bankruptcy and by adverse economic conditions.  Also included in the category of consumer loans are home equity loans.  Home equity lines of credit are generally made as second mortgages and charged a variable interest rate.  Home equity lines are written with ten-year terms but are reviewed annually.  The Company’s consumer loans also consist of seasonal refund anticipation loans (“RAL’s”) offered by Loan Central during the tax season.  RAL’s are short-term cash advances against a customer's anticipated income tax refund.
Underwriting Standards
 
The Company’s underwriting guidelines and standards are updated periodically and are presented to the Board of Directors of the holding company for approval.  The purposes of the standards and guidelines are to grant loans on a sound and collectible basis; to invest available funds in a safe, profitable manner; to serve the legitimate credit needs of the Company’s primary market areas; and to ensure that all loan applicants receive fair and equal treatment in the lending process.  It is the intent of the underwriting guidelines and standards to:  minimize losses by carefully investigating the credit history of each applicant, verify the source of repayment and the ability of the applicant to repay, collateralize those loans in which collateral is deemed to be required, exercise care in the documentation of the application, review, approval, and origination process, and administer a comprehensive loan collection program.  The above guidelines are adhered to and subject to the experience, background and personal judgment of the loan officer assigned to the loan application.  A loan officer may grant, with justification, a loan with variances from the underwriting guidelines and standards.  However, a loan officer may not exceed his or her respective lending authority without obtaining the prior, proper approval from a superior.

Investment Activities
 
The Company’s investment policy stresses the management of the investment securities portfolio, which includes both securities held to maturity and securities available for sale, to maximize the return over the long-term in a manner that is consistent with good banking practices and relative safety of principal.  The Company’s investment portfolio is comprised of U.S. Government sponsored entity and mortgage-backed securities as well as obligations of state and political subdivisions.  Revenues from interest and dividends on securities accounted for 5.48%, 5.29% and 5.69% of total consolidated revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The Company currently does not engage in trading account activity.
Funding Activities
 
Sources of funds for loan and investment activities include “core deposits.”  Core deposits include demand deposits, savings, money market, NOW accounts, and certificates of deposit less than $100,000.  The Company will also utilize certificates of deposit and money market deposits from wholesale markets, when necessary, to support growth in assets.  Short- and long-term advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank have also been a significant source of funding.  Further funding has come from one trust preferred securities offering through Ohio Valley Statutory Trust III, totaling $8,500,000.  Ohio Valley used the proceeds to provide additional capital to the Bank to support growth.  
Electronic Refund Check / Electronic Refund Deposit Activities
 
The Company began its participation in a tax refund service in 2006, in which it served as a facilitator for the clearing of tax refunds for a single tax refund product provider.  An agreement between the Bank and the original provider required the Bank to process electronic refund checks ("ERC's") and electronic refund deposits ("ERD's") presented for payment on behalf of taxpayers containing taxpayer refunds.  The Bank, in turn, received a fee paid by the provider for each transaction that was processed by the Bank.  As a result of ERC/ERD fee activity being mostly seasonal, the majority of income was generally recorded during the first half of the fiscal year, with only minimal income recorded thereafter.  During the year ended 2018, the Company's ERC/ERD fees totaled $1,579,000 and the Company recorded $894,000 of interest income on the temporary maintenance of tax refunds by the Bank.  In 2015 the agreement between the Bank and the original provider, which had a term ending at December 31, 2019, was assumed by MetaBank.  MetaBank ceased utilizing the services of the Bank at the end of 2018.  The Bank has not yet established a relationship with a different third-party provider of such tax refund products.
Competition
 
Competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase, with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives.  The principal factors of competition for the Company’s banking business are the rates of interest charged for loans, the rates of interest paid for deposits, the fees charged for services and the availability and quality of services.  The market area for the Bank is concentrated primarily in the Gallia, Jackson, Pike and Meigs Counties of Ohio as well as the Mason and Cabell Counties of West Virginia.  Some additional business originates from the surrounding Ohio counties of Lawrence, Vinton, Scioto, Athens, Ross, Pickaway and Madison.  Competition for deposits and loans comes primarily from local banks and savings associations, although some competition is also experienced from local credit unions and insurance companies.  The Company also competes with non-financial institutions that offer financial products and services.  Some of the Company’s competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and oversight that is required of banks and bank holding companies.  As a result, some of these competitors may have lower cost structures.

Loan Central’s market presence further strengthens the Company’s ability to compete in the Gallia, Jackson, Lawrence and Pike Counties by serving a consumer base that may not meet the Bank’s credit standards.  Loan Central also operates in Scioto and Ross counties of Ohio, which are outside the Bank’s primary market area.  With the exception of Loan Central’s tax refund loan activities and the Bank’s ERC/ERD activities, the Company’s business is not seasonal, nor is it dependent upon a single or small group of customers.
 
Historically, larger regional institutions, with substantially greater resources, have been generating a growing market presence.  Yet, in recent years, the financial industry continues to consolidate, which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions, while strengthening the acquiring companies.  Many financial institutions have experienced significant challenges as a result of the economic crisis, which resulted in bank failures and significant intervention from the U.S. Government.
 
Overall, the Company believes it is able to compete effectively in both current and newer markets.  There can be no assurance, however, that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate yield on our loans will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop.
 
Supervision and Regulation
 
The following is a summary of certain statutes and regulations affecting Ohio Valley as well as the Bank and Loan Central.  The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations. The regulation of financial holding companies and their subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of consumers, depositors, borrowers, the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of shareholders.  Applicable laws and regulations restrict permissible activities and investments, and require actions to protect loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary and other customers, as well as the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund.  They also may restrict Ohio Valley’s abilty to repurchase its common shares or to receive dividends from the Bank, and impose capital adequacy and liquidity requirements.
Regulation of Financial Holding Company
 
Ohio Valley is subject to the requirements of the BHC Act and to the reporting requirements of, and examination and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”).  The Federal Reserve Board also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to:

· | assess civil money penalties;
--+------------------------------


· | issue cease and desist or removal orders; and
--+----------------------------------------------


· | require that a bank holding company divest subsidiaries (including its banking subsidiaries).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In general, the Federal Reserve Board may initiate enforcement action for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.
 
A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support those subsidiary banks.  The Federal Reserve Board may require a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank and may disapprove of the payment of dividends to the shareholders of the bank holding company if the Federal Reserve Board believes the payment would be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve Board also requires bank holding companies to provide advance notification of planned dividends under certain circumstances.
 

8
 
The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board in any case where a bank holding company proposes to:
 
 
· | acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank that is not already majority-owned by it;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

Holding Company Activities
 
Ohio Valley became a financial holding company during 2000, permitting it to engage in activities beyond those permitted for traditional bank holding companies.  In order to become a financial holding company, all of a bank holding company’s depository institutions must be well capitalized and well managed under federal banking regulations, and the depository institutions must have received a Community Reinvestment Act rating of at least satisfactory.  In addition, the holding company must be well managed and, unless it is a small bank holding company under the Federal Reserve Board’s Small Bank Holding Company and Small Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy, must be well capitalized.
 
Financial holding companies may engage in a wide variety of financial activities, including any activity that the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury Department consider financial in nature or incidental to financial activities, and any activity that the Federal Reserve Board determines complementary to a financial activity and which does not pose a substantial safety and soundness risk.  These activities include securities underwriting and dealing activities, insurance and underwriting activities and merchant banking/equity investment activities.  Because it has authority to engage in a broad array of financial activities, a financial holding company may have several affiliates that are functionally regulated by financial regulators other than the Federal Reserve Board, such as the SEC and state insurance regulators.
 
If a financial holding company or a subsidiary bank fails to meet the requirements for the holding company to remain a financial holding company, the financial holding company must enter into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve Board within 45 days to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements.  Until the Federal Reserve Board determines that the holding company and its subsidiary banks meet the requirements, the Federal Reserve Board may impose additional limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the financial holding company or any affiliate that the Federal Reserve Board finds to be appropriate or consistent with federal banking laws.  If the deficiencies are not corrected within 180 days, the financial holding company may be required to divest ownership or control of all banks.  If restrictions are imposed on the activities of the holding company, such restrictions may not be made publicly available pursuant to confidentiality regulations of the banking regulators. 
 
Loan Central is supervised and regulated by the State of Ohio Department of Financial Institutions, Division of Consumer Finance (“ODFI”).  Ohio Valley Financial Services is supervised and regulated by the State of Ohio Department of Insurance. OVBC Captive is supervised and regulated by the State of Nevada Division of Insurance. The insurance laws and regulations applicable to insurance agencies, including Ohio Valley Financial Services and OVBC Captive, require education and licensing of individual agents and agencies, require reports and impose business conduct rules.
 
Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act
 
On May 25, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”) was signed into law.  The Regulatory Relief Act was designed to provide regulatory relief for banking organizations, particularly for all but the very largest, those with assets in excess of $250 billion.  Bank holding companies with assets of less than $100 billion are no longer subject to enhanced prudential standards, and those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be relieved of those requirements in 18 months, unless the Federal Reserve Board takes action to maintain those standards.  Certain regulatory requirements applied only to banks with assets in excess of $50 billion and so did not apply to Ohio Valley even before the enactment of the Regulatory Relief Act.

The Regulatory Relief Act also provides that the banking regulators must adopt regulations implementing the provision that banking organizations with assets of less than $10 billion are permitted to satisfy capital standards and be considered “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework if their leverage ratios of tangible assets to average consolidated assets is between 8% and 10%, unless the bank’s federal banking agency determines that the organization’s risk profile warrants a more stringent leverage ratio.  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have proposed for comment the leverage ratio framework for any banking organization with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, limited amounts of certain types of assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9%.  The community bank leverage ratio would be calculated as the ratio of tangible equity capital divided by average total consolidated assets.  Tangible equity capital would be defined as total bank equity capital  or total holding company equity capital, as applicable, prior to including minority interests, and excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, goodwill and other intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing assets).  Average total assets would be calculated in a manner similar to the current tier 1 leverage ratio denominator in that amounts deducted from the community bank leverage ratio numerator would also be excluded from the community bank leverage ratio denominator.
 
The OCC, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC also adopted a rule providing banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of new current expected credit loss methodology accounting under U. S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
 
The Regulatory Relief Act also relieves bank holding companies and banks with assets of less than $100 billion in assets from certain record-keeping, reporting and disclosure requirements.
 
Transactions with Affiliates, Directors, Executive Officers and Shareholders
 
Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W restrict transactions by banks and their subsidiaries with their affiliates.  An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank.
Generally, Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W:
 
 
· | limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of that bank’s capital stock and surplus (i.e., tangible capital); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with all affiliates to 20% of that bank’s capital stock and surplus; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank subsidiary, as those provided to a non-affiliate. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to the affiliate, the purchase of assets from the affiliate, the issuance of a guarantee on behalf of the affiliate, the purchase of securities issued by the affiliate, and other similar types of transactions.
 
 

10
 

A bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders, as well as entities such persons control, is subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereunder by the Federal Reserve Board.  Among other things, these loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals or be made as part of a benefit or compensation program and on terms widely available to employees, and must not involve a greater than normal risk of repayment.  In addition, the amount of loans a bank may make to these persons is based, in part, on the bank’s capital position, and specified approval procedures must be followed in making loans which exceed specified amounts.
 
Regulation of Ohio State Chartered Banks
 
As an Ohio state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (“FRB”), the Bank is supervised and regulated primarily by the ODFI and the Federal Reserve Board.  The Bank is also subject to the regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which has broad authority to adopt and enforce consumer protection regulations.
 
The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC, and the Bank is subject to the applicable provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and certain regulations of the FDIC.
 
Various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the United States, the State of Ohio and the State of West Virginia affect the operations of the Bank, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon, restrictions relating to investments and other activities, limitations on credit exposure to correspondent banks, limitations on activities based on capital and surplus, limitations on payment of dividends, limitations on branching and increasingly extensive consumer protection laws and regulations.
 In 2017, the State of Ohio completed a substantial re-writing of Ohio’s banking laws that became effective on January 1, 2018.  One of the primary purposes of the revision of the law was to adopt one universal bank charter for depository institutions chartered by the state, rather than having separate types of state depository institution charters with different powers and limitations for banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations.  The result is that all Ohio-chartered depository institutions are now considered to have full commercial bank powers, unless an institution elects to continue to be governed by federal restrictions applicable to federal savings and loan associations and federal savings banks.  While the most substantial changes in the law affect institutions chartered by Ohio as savings banks or savings and loan associations prior to the effectiveness of the new law, some changes also apply to institutions, like the Bank, that were chartered as commercial banks prior to the change in the law.  The changes for all Ohio-chartered banks include provisions allowing Ohio-chartered banks to exercise the same powers, perform all acts, and provide all services that are permitted for federally chartered depository institutions, with the exception of laws and regulations dealing with interest rates, thereby enhancing opportunities for Ohio-chartered banks to compete with other financial institutions.  Other provisions clarify previous laws addressing, or allow more flexibility with respect to, corporate governance matters, mergers and acquisitions and additional reliance on Ohio corporate law generally.
 Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations
 
Banks are subject to regular examination to ensure compliance with federal statutes and regulations applicable to their business, including consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations.  Potential penalties under these laws include, but are not limited to, fines. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) established the CFPB, which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has adopted numerous rules with respect to consumer protection laws, amending some existing regulations and adopting new ones, and has commenced enforcement actions. The following are just some of the consumer protection laws applicable to the Bank:

 

11
 


 
· | Community Reinvestment Act of 1977: imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation to fulfill the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The banking regulators also use their authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices by banks that may not necessarily fall within the scope of specific banking or consumer finance law.
 In October 2017, the CFPB issued a final rule with respect to certain consumer loans to be effective on January 16, 2018, although compliance with most sections is required starting on August 19, 2019.  The first major part of the rule makes it an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make short-term and longer-term loans with balloon payments (with certain exceptions) without reasonably determining that the borrower has the ability to repay the loan.  The second major part of the rule applies to the same types of loans as well as certain other longer-term loans that are repaid directly from the borrower’s account.  The rule states that it is an unfair and abusive pactice for the lender to withdraw payment from the borrower’s account after two consecutive payment attempts have failed, unless the lender obtains the consumer’s new and specific authorization to make further withdrawals from the account.  The rule also requires lenders to provide certain notices to the borrower before attempting to withdraw payment on a covered loan from the borrower’s account.
 
On February 6, 2019, the CFPB issued two proposals with respect to the Payday Rule.  First, the CFPB proposed to delay the compliance date for the mandatory underwriting provisions of the Payday Rule to November 19, 2020.  It has requested comments on the proposed delay to be made within 30 days.  Second, the CFPB proposed to rescind provisions of the Payday Rule that (1) provide that it is an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make a covered short-term or longer-term ballon-payment loan without reasonably determining that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan according to its terms; (2) prescribe mandatory underwriting requirements for making the ability-to-repay determination; (3) provide exemptions of certain loans from the mandatory underwriting requirements; and (4) provide related definitions, reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  The CFPB has requrested comments to be made within 90 days on this proposal.  These proposals do not change the provisions of the Payday Rule that address lender payment practices with respect to covered loans.  The CFPB also stated that it will be considering other changes to the Payday Rule in response to requests received for exemptions of certain types of lenders or loan products and may commence separate additional rulemaking initiatives.

The impact of this rule on the Bank, both with and without the proposed amendments, is estimated to be minimal. The Bank originates very few, if any, loans covered by the rule as written or amended. The law’s effect on Ohio Valley’s consumer finance subsidiary, Loan Central, would be more burdensome under the rule as written in 2017. The 2017 version of the rule would have a material effect on several Loan Central loan products, including tax refund related loans. The 2019 amended rule would have substantially less of an impact on Loan Central’s loan products.
 
Ohio law requires that lenders in Ohio, with exemptions for banks, savings associations, credit unions and certain other financial institutions, obtain licenses and comply with numerous restrictions on various types of consumer lending.  The regulations address maximum permissible interest rates,  duration, amounts, permissible collateral, underwriting, renewals, collection and various other aspects of such loans.  On July 30, 2018, Ohio adopted a law (“HB 123”) placing much greater restrictions on such loans originated after April 26, 2019.  While the Bank is exempt from such laws, Ohio Valley’s consumer finance subsidiary, Loan Central, is not.  Loan Central may need to cease making most of its loans, consisting of tax refund related loans, when HB 123 becomes applicable.  Because most of Loan Central’s lending each year occurs before the end of April, the new law should not have a material effect on Loan Central and Ohio Valley for 2019.  Ohio Valley and Loan Central will continue to analyze the law and pursue potential ways to reduce the effect of the law on Loan Central before Loan Central’s 2020 tax season related lending commences in late 2019.
 
Capital Requirements
 
Financial institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain capital as a way of absorbing losses that can, as well as losses that cannot, be predicted.  The Federal Reserve Board has adopted risk-based capital guidelines for financial holding companies as well as state banks that are members of a Federal Reserve Bank.  The OCC and the FDIC have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for national banks and state non-member banks, respectively.  The guidelines provide a systematic analytical framework which makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures expressly into account in evaluating capital adequacy and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets.  Capital levels as measured by these standards are also used to categorize financial institutions for purposes of certain prompt corrective action regulatory provisions.
 
The risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies are based on the “International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standard” (Basel I), published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”).  New capital rules applicable to smaller banking organizations (the “Basel III Capital Rules”), which also implement certain of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, became effective commencing on January 1, 2015.  Compliance with the new minimum capital requirements was required effective on January 1, 2015, whereas a new capital conservation buffer and deductions from common equity capital phase in from January 1, 2016, through January 1, 2019, and most deductions from common equity tier 1 capital will phase in from January 1, 2015, through January 1, 2019.
 
The rules include (a) a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent, (b) a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 percent, (c) a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 percent, and (d) a minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average assets) of 4%.
 
Common equity for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio includes common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, plus limited amounts of minority interests in the form of common stock, less the majority of certain regulatory deductions.
 
Tier 1 capital includes common equity as defined for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, plus certain non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, cumulative preferred stock and related surplus and trust preferred securities that have been grandfathered (but which are not permitted going forward), and limited amounts of minority interests in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, less certain deductions.
 

13
 

Tier 2 capital, which can be included in the total capital ratio, includes certain capital instruments (such as subordinated debt) and limited amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to new eligibility criteria, less applicable deductions.
 
The deductions from common equity tier 1 capital include goodwill and other intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, mortgage-servicing assets above certain levels, gains on sale in connection with a securitization, investments in a banking organization’s own capital instruments and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (above certain levels).
 
Under the guidelines, capital is compared to the relative risk related to the balance sheet.  To derive the risk included in the balance sheet, one of several risk weights is applied to different balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty.  The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.  Some of the risk weightings were changed effective January 1, 2015.
 
The rules also place restrictions on the payment of capital distributions, including dividends, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the company does not hold a capital conservation buffer of greater than 2.5 percent composed of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, or if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5 percent at the beginning of the quarter.  The capital conservation buffer phases in starting on January 1, 2016, at .625% and effective January 1, 2019, is fully phased in at 2.5%.
 
Federal banking regulators have established regulations governing prompt corrective action to resolve capital deficient banks.  Under these regulations, institutions which become undercapitalized become subject to mandatory regulatory scrutiny and limitations, which increase as capital continues to decrease.  Such institutions are also required to file capital plans with their primary federal regulator, and their holding companies must guarantee the capital shortfall up to 5% of the assets of the capital deficient institution at the time it becomes undercapitalized.
 
Effective January 1, 2015, in order to be “well-capitalized,” a bank must have a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and the bank must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level or any capital measure.  Ohio Valley’s management believes that the Bank meets the ratio requirements to be deemed “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action regulations.
 
A bank with a capital level that might qualify for well capitalized or adequately capitalized status may nevertheless be treated as though the bank is in the next lower capital category if the bank’s primary federal banking supervisory authority determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or practice warrants that treatment.  A bank’s operations can be significantly affected by its capital classification under the prompt corrective action rules.  For example, a bank that is not well capitalized generally is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market without advance regulatory approval.  These deposit-funding limitations can have an adverse effect on the bank’s liquidity.  At each successively lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to additional restrictions.  Undercapitalized banks are required to take specified actions to increase their capital or otherwise decrease the risks to the federal deposit insurance fund. Bank regulatory agencies generally are required to appoint a receiver or conservator within 90 days after a bank becomes critically undercapitalized, with a leverage ratio of less than 2%.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that a federal bank regulatory authority may require a bank holding company to divest itself of an undercapitalized bank subsidiary if the agency determines that divestiture will improve the bank’s financial condition and prospects.
 
 

14
 
In September 2017, the Federal Reserve Board, along with other bank regulatory agencies, proposed amendments to its capital requirements to simplify various aspects of the capital rules for community banks, including the Bank, in an attempt to reduce the regulatory burden for such smaller financial institutions.  In November 2017, the federal banking agencies extended, for the community banks, the existing capital requirements for certain items that were scheduled to change effective January 1, 2018, in light of the simplification amendments being considered. As described above, the bank regulatory agencies have proposed revised capital requirements under the Regulatory Relief Act.
 
Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board generally require a financial holding company to maintain total risk-based capital of 10.0% and Tier 1 risk-based capital of 6.0%.  If, however, a bank holding company satisfies the requirements of the Federal Reserve Board’s Small Bank Holding Company and Small Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement (the “SBHCP”), the holding company is not required to meet the consolidated capital requirements.  As amended effective in September 2018, the SBHCP requires that the holding company have assets of less than $3 billion, that it meet certain qualitative requirements, and that all of the holding company’s bank subsidiaries meet all bank capital requirements.  As of December 31, 2018, Ohio Valley was deemed to meet the SBHCP requirements and so was not required to meet consolidated capital requirements at the holding company level.
 
Limits on Dividends
 
The ability of a bank holding company to obtain funds for the payment of dividends and for other cash requirements is largely dependent on the amount of dividends that may be declared by its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries.  However, the Federal Reserve Board expects Ohio Valley to serve as a source of strength to the Bank, which may require it to retain capital for further investments in the Bank, rather than for dividends for shareholders of Ohio Valley.  The Bank may not pay dividends to Ohio Valley if, after paying such dividends, it would fail to meet the required capital levels. Dividends are also subject to limitations if the Company or the Bank fails to hold the required capital conservation buffer.  The Bank must have the approval of its regulatory authorities if a dividend in any year would cause the total dividends for that year to exceed the sum of its current year’s net profits and retained net profits for the preceding two years, less required transfers to surplus.  Under Ohio law, the Bank may pay a dividend from surplus only with the approval of its shareholders and the approval of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions.  Payment of dividends by the Bank may be restricted at any time at the discretion of its regulatory authorities, if they deem such dividends to constitute an unsafe and/or unsound banking practice or if necessary to maintain adequate capital for the Bank.  These provisions could have the effect of limiting Ohio Valley’s ability to pay dividends on its outstanding common shares.
 
In addition, Federal Reserve Board policy requires Ohio Valley to provide notice to the FRB in advance of the payment of a dividend to Ohio Valley’s shareholders under certain circumstances, and the FRB may disapprove of such dividend payment if the FRB determines the payment would be an unsafe or unsound practice.
 
Dividend restrictions are also listed within the provisions of Ohio Valley’s trust preferred security arrangements.  Under the provisions of these agreements, the interest payable on the trust preferred securities is deferral for up to five years and any such deferral would not be considered a default.  During any period of deferral, Ohio Valley would be precluded from declaring or paying dividends to its shareholders or repurchasing any of its common stock.
 
Deposit Insurance Assessments
 
The FDIC is an independent federal agency which insures deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, of federally-insured banks and savings associations and safeguards the safety and soundness of the financial institution industry.  The deposits of the Bank are insured up to statutorily prescribed limits by the FDIC, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor.
 

15
 
As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by insured institutions, including the Bank, to prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines to pose a threat to the deposit insurance fund, and to take enforcement actions against insured institutions.  The FDIC may terminate insurance of deposits of any institution if it finds that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or other regulatory agency.
 
The FDIC assesses a quarterly deposit insurance premium on each insured institution based on risk characteristics of the institution and may also impose special assessments in emergency situations.  The premiums fund the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”).  Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (“DRR”), which is the amount in the DIF as a percentage of all DIF insured deposits.  In March 2016, the FDIC adopted final rules designed to meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets of less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%.  Although the FDIC’s new rules reduced assessment rates on all banks, they imposed a surcharge on banks with assets of $10 billion or more to be paid until the DRR reaches 1.35%.  The DRR reached 1.36% at September 30, 2018.  The rules also provide assessment credits to banks with assets of less than $10 billion for the portion of their assessments that contribute to the increase of the DRR to 1.35%.  Such credits will be applied when the reserve ratio is at least 1.38%.  The rules further changed the method of determining risk-based assessment rates for established banks with less than $10 billion in assets to better ensure that banks taking on greater risks pay more for deposit insurance than banks that take on less risk.
 
In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, which was established by the government to recapitalize a predecessor to the DIF.  These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in September of 2019. The Financing Coproration has projected that the last assessment will be collected on the March 29, 2019, FDIC invoice.
 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the insured institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition enacted or imposed by the bank's regulatory agency.  Notice would be given to all depositors before the deposit insurance was terminated.
 
Community Reinvestment Act
 
The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”) requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice.  Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to hep meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit or other financial assistance to low and moderate-income individuals and communities.  Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA.  As of its most recent evaluation, the Bank was assigned an overall CRA rating of “Satisfactory.”
Customer Privacy Protections
 
The Bank is subject to regulations limiting the ability of financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties.  These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated party.
Monetary Policy and Economic Conditions
 
The business of commercial banks is affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board.  The Federal Reserve Board regulates the money and credit conditions and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions primarily through open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits.  These policies and regulations significantly influence the amount of bank loans and deposits and the interest rates charged and paid thereon, and thus have an effect on earnings.

Patriot Act
 
The Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorist Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) gives the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements.  Title III of the Patriot Act takes measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies.  Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions.  Among other requirements, Title III and related regulations require regulated financial institutions to establish a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts and establish enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report suspicious activity.  The Company has established policies and procedures to comply with the requirements of the Patriot Act.
Executive and Incentive Compensation
 
In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC issued joint interagecy guidance on incentive compensation policies (the “Joint Guidance”) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking.  This principles-based guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to affect materially the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should:  (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks; (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors.  The Joint Guidance made incentive compensation part of the regulatory agencies’ examination process, with the findings of the supervisory intiatives included in reports of examination and enforcement actions possible.
 
In 2011, federal bank regulatory agencies jointly issued proposed rules on incentive-based compensation arrangements under applicable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “First Proposed Joint Rules”).  The First Proposed Joint Rules generally would have applied to financial institutions with $1 billion or more in assets that maintain incentive-based compensation arrangements for certain covered employees.
 
In May 2016, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved a second joint notice of proposed rules (“the Second Proposed Joint Rules”) designed to prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks at financial institutions.  The Second Proposed Joint Rules would apply to covered financial institutions with total assets of $1 billion or more.  The requirements of the Second Proposed Joint Rules would differ for each of three categories of financial institutions:
 
 
· | Level 1 consists of institutions with assets of $250 billion or more;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Level 2 consists of institutions with assets of at least $50 billion and less than $250 billion; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Level 3 consists of institutions with assets of at least $1 billion and less than $50 billion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Some of the requirements would apply only to Level 1 and Level 2 institutions.  For all covered institutions, including Level 3 institutions, the Second Proposed Joint Rules would:
 
 

17
 

 
· | prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that are “excessive” or “could lead to material financial loss;”
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | require incentive based compensation that is consistent with a balance of risk and reward, effective management and control of risk, and effective governance; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | require board oversight, recordkeeping and disclosure to the appropriate regulatory agency.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Level 1 and Level 2 institutions would have additional requirements, including deferrals of awards to certain covered persons; potential downward adjustments, forfeitures or clawbacks; and additional risk-management and control standards, policies and procedures.  In addition, certain practices and types of incentive compensation would be prohibited.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, Ohio Valley and its subsidiaries had approximately 300 full-time equivalent employees and officers.  Management considers its relationship with its employees and officers to be good.
Other Information
 
Management anticipates no material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company by reason of any laws regulating or protecting the environment.  Ohio Valley believes that the nature of the operations of its subsidiaries has little, if any, environmental impact.  Ohio Valley, therefore, anticipates no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in its current fiscal year or for the foreseeable future.
 
The Bank and Loan Central may be required to make capital expenditures related to properties which they may acquire through foreclosure proceedings in the future.  However, the amount of such capital expenditures, if any, is not currently determinable.
 
Neither Ohio Valley nor its subsidiaries have any material patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises or concessions.  No material amounts have been spent on research activities, and no employees are engaged full-time in research activities.
 
Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales
 
Ohio Valley’s subsidiaries do not have any offices located in a foreign country, and they have no foreign assets, liabilities, or related income and expense.
