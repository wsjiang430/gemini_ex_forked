Item 1. Business 
OVERVIEW 
We are a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed in 2014 by US Development Group LLC, or USD, to acquire, develop and operate midstream infrastructure and complementary logistics solutions for crude oil, biofuels and other energy-related products. We generate substantially all of our operating cash flows from multi-year, take-or-pay contracts with primarily investment grade customers, including major integrated oil companies, refiners and marketers. Our network of crude oil terminals facilitates the transportation of heavy crude oil from Western Canada to key demand centers across North America. Our operations include railcar loading and unloading, storage and blending in onsite tanks, inbound and outbound pipeline connectivity, truck transloading, as well as other related logistics services. We also provide our customers with leased railcars and fleet services to facilitate the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons by rail. 
We generally do not take ownership of the products that we handle nor do we receive any payments from our customers based on the value of such products. On occasion we enter into buy-sell arrangements in which we take temporary title to commodities while in our terminals. We expect any such arrangements to be at fixed prices where we do not take commodity price exposure.
We believe rail will continue as an important transportation option for energy producers, refiners and marketers due to its unique advantages relative to other transportation means. Specifically, rail transportation of energy-related products provides flexible access to key demand centers on a relatively low fixed-cost basis with faster physical delivery, while preserving the specific quality of customer products over long distances. As the role of biofuels continues to expand in the clean energy transition, we are committed to offering new capabilities and services across growing demand in clean fuels to include ethanol, renewable diesel and biodiesel. 
USD Group LLC, or USDG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of USD and the sole owner of our general partner, is engaged in designing, developing, owning, and managing large-scale multi-modal logistics centers and energy-related infrastructure across North America. USDG’s solutions create flexible market access for customers in significant growth areas and key demand centers, including Western Canada, the U.S. Gulf Coast and Mexico. During 2021, USD, along with its joint venture partner, successfully completed construction on and placed into service a diluent recovery unit, or DRU, near Hardisty, Alberta, Canada, as a part of a long-term solution to transport heavier grades of crude oil produced in Western Canada by rail, discussed in more detail below. USD believes the DRU project will maximize benefits to producers, refiners and railroads. Additionally, in January 2019, USDG completed an expansion project at the Partnership’s Hardisty Terminal, or Hardisty South, which added one and one-half 120-railcar unit trains of transloading capacity per day, or approximately 112,500 barrels per day, or bpd, which we acquired in April 2022. USDG is also currently pursuing the development of a premier energy logistics terminal on the Houston Ship Channel with capacity for substantial tank storage, multiple docks (including barge and deepwater), inbound and outbound pipeline connectivity, as well as a rail terminal with unit train capabilities. In addition, USD Clean Fuels LLC, or USDCF, a subsidiary of USD, was organized in 2021 for the purpose of providing production and logistics solutions to the growing market for clean energy transportation fuels, as discussed below in further detail.
The following table summarizes information about our current terminalling facility assets: 

Terminal Name | Location | Designed Capacity (Bpd) | CommodityHandled | PrimaryCustomers | TerminalType
Hardisty Terminal | Alberta, Canada | ~262,500 (1) | Crude Oil | Producers/Refiners/Marketers | Origination 
Casper Terminal | Wyoming, U.S. | ~105,000 (2) | Crude Oil | Refiners/Marketers | Origination 
Stroud Terminal | Oklahoma, U.S. | ~50,000 (3) | Crude Oil | Producers | Destination 
West Colton Terminal | California, U.S. | 13,000 | Ethanol/Renewable Diesel | Refiners/Blenders | Destination 

(1)Represents the capacity of the combined Hardisty Terminal which includes the legacy Hardisty Terminal and the Hardisty South Terminal. The designed capacity is based on three and one-half 120-railcar unit trains comprised of 28,371 gallon (approximately 675.5 barrels, or bbls) railcars being loaded at 92.5% of volumetric capacity per day. Actual amount of crude oil loading capacity may vary based on factors including the size of the unit trains, the size, type and volumetric capacity of the railcars utilized and the type and specifications of crude oil loaded, among other factors.
(2)Based on one and one-half 112-railcar unit trains comprised of 28,371 gallon (approximately 675.5 bbls) railcars being loaded at 92.5% of volumetric capacity per day. Actual amount of crude oil loading capacity may vary based on factors including the size of the unit train, the size, type and volumetric capacity of the railcars utilized and the type and specifications of crude oil loaded, among other factors.
(3)Our current Stroud Terminal capacity of approximately 50,000 Bpd includes pipeline pumping capacity constraints on the pipeline that is utilized to move crude oil between our Stroud Terminal storage tanks and third-party storage tanks at Cushing. With pump modifications, the 104-railcar unit train could unload up to 65,000 Bpd based on 28,371 gallon (approximately 675.5 bbls) railcars being unloaded at 92.5% of volumetric capacity per day. Actual amount of crude oil loading capacity may vary based on factors including the size of the unit train, the size, type and volumetric capacity of the railcars utilized and the type and specifications of crude oil unloaded, among other factors.
We offer our terminalling services pursuant to multi-year, take-or-pay agreements primarily with high quality, investment grade customers. Our agreements typically range in term between three and ten years and include renewal options. As of December 31, 2022, the volume-weighted average remaining contract life of our take-or-pay terminal service agreements was 7.1 years. Refer to the Business Segments section below for further information regarding our customer contracts for each of our rail terminals.
In addition to terminalling services, we currently provide a customer with leased railcars and fleet services related to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons by rail on a take-or-pay basis. In the aggregate, our master fleet services agreement has a remaining contract life of six months as of December 31, 2022. Although we expect to continue to assist our customers in obtaining railcars for their use transporting crude oil to or from our terminals, we do not intend to continue to act as an intermediary between railcar lessors and our customers as our existing lease agreement expires. Should market conditions change, we could potentially act as an intermediary with railcar lessors on behalf of our customers again in the future.
We believe one of our key strengths is our relationship with our sponsor, USDG, the sole direct subsidiary of USD. USD was among the first companies to successfully develop the hydrocarbon-by-rail concept and has built or operated unit train-capable terminals with an aggregate capacity of over one million bpd. Ten of these terminals were subsequently sold in multiple transactions for an aggregate sales price in excess of $740 million. From January 2006 through December 2022, USD has loaded or handled through its terminal network a total of approximately 450 million barrels, or MMbbls, of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels. USD also has a nationally recognized safety record with only one recordable injury, that did not result in lost time, and one reportable spill at its terminals since 2008, as defined by the regulatory agencies with applicable jurisdiction, including in the United States the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, the U.S. Department of Transportation, or DOT, and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA. There have been no reportable injuries or spills associated with the Partnership’s assets. USD is currently owned by Energy Capital Partners, Goldman Sachs and certain of USD’s management team members.
In September 2014, Energy Capital Partners made a significant investment in USD. Energy Capital Partners, together with its affiliates and affiliated funds, is a private equity firm with over $27.0 billion in capital commitments that primarily invests in North America’s energy infrastructure. Energy Capital Partners has significant energy infrastructure, midstream, master limited partnership and financial expertise to complement its investment in USD. To date, Energy Capital Partners and its affiliated funds have 61 investment platforms with investments in the renewable and power generation, environmental infrastructure and midstream sectors of the energy industry. 
USD, through its direct ownership of USDG, has stated that it intends for us to be its primary growth vehicle in North America. We intend to strategically expand our business by acquiring energy-related logistics assets related to the storage and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels from both USDG and third parties, to the extent opportunities exist that are accretive to our unitholders. We also intend to grow organically by opportunistically pursuing growth projects and enhancing the profitability of our existing assets. We believe that our relationship with USD and its successful project development and operating history, safety track record and industry relationships provide us with many avenues to execute our growth strategy.
The following chart depicts a simplified organization and ownership structure as of December 31, 2022. The ownership percentages referred to below illustrate the relationships among us, our general partner, USDG, USD, Energy Capital Partners and Goldman Sachs, and excludes 1,438,355 phantom unit awards, or Phantom Units, outstanding under our Long-Term Incentive Plan at December 31, 2022.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
Our primary business objective is to generate sustainable free cash flow to strengthen our financial position and prudently grow the quarterly cash distributions we make to our unitholders over time. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following business strategies:
•    Generate stable and predictable fee-based cash flows.    A substantial amount of the operating cash flow we expect to generate is attributable to multi-year, take-or-pay agreements. We intend to seek stable and predictable cash flows by extending the term of our agreements with existing customers, as well as executing additional multi-year, take-or-pay agreements with existing and new customers across our terminal network. 
•    Pursue accretive acquisitions.    We intend to pursue strategic and accretive acquisitions of energy-related logistics assets related to the storage and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels from both USD and third parties. We regularly evaluate and monitor the marketplace to identify acquisitions and expansions that may be pursued independently or jointly with USD.
•    Pursue organic growth initiatives and expansions.    We intend to pursue organic growth opportunities and seek operational efficiencies that complement, optimize or improve the profitability of our assets. For example, as the role of biofuels continues to expand in the clean energy transition, we are committed to offering new capabilities and services across growing demand in clean fuels to include ethanol, renewable diesel and biodiesel. 
•    Maintain a conservative capital structure.    We intend to maintain a conservative capital structure which, when combined with our focus on stable, fee-based cash flows, should support access to capital at a competitive cost, subject to market conditions. Consistent with our disciplined financial approach, we intend to fund the capital required for expansion and acquisition projects through a balanced combination of equity and debt financing. We believe this approach may provide us with the flexibility to effectively pursue accretive acquisitions and organic growth projects as they become available. 
•    Maintain safe, reliable and efficient operations.    We are committed to safe, efficient and reliable operations that comply with environmental and safety regulations. We strive to continually improve operating performance through our commitment to technologically-advanced logistics and operations systems, employee training programs and other safety initiatives and programs with railroads, railcar producers and first responders. All of our facilities currently meet or exceed applicable government safety regulations and are in compliance with recently enacted orders regarding the movement of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels by rail. We believe these objectives are integral to the success of our business as well as to our access to growth opportunities.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We conduct our business through two distinct reporting segments: Terminalling services and Fleet services.
These segments have unique business activities that require different operating strategies. For information relating to revenues from external customers, operating income or loss and total assets for each segment, refer to Note 15. Segment Reporting of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. For information relating to revenues from material customers, refer to Note 17. Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report.
Terminalling Services
The Terminalling services segment includes a network of strategically-located terminals that provide customers with railcar loading and/or unloading capacity, as well as related logistics services, for crude oil and biofuels. These services are primarily provided under multi-year, take-or-pay agreements that include minimum monthly commitment fees. We generally have no direct commodity price exposure, although changes in crude oil prices could indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long term. We may on occasion enter into buy-sell and other arrangements in which we take temporary title to commodities while held in our terminals. We expect any such agreements to be at fixed prices where we do not take commodity price exposure. 
Our Terminalling services business consists of the following operations:
Hardisty Terminal
Our Hardisty Terminal, which commenced operations in June 2014, is an origination terminal where we load various grades of Canadian crude oil onto railcars for transportation to end markets. Hardisty is one of the major crude oil hubs in North America and is an origination point for several major export pipelines to the United States. In April 2022, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the entities owning the Hardisty South Terminal assets from USDG. The new combined Hardisty Terminal, which includes our legacy Hardisty Terminal and the newly acquired Hardisty South Terminal, now has the designed takeaway capacity of three and one-half unit trains per day, or approximately 262,500 barrels per day and consists of a fixed loading rack with approximately 60 railcar loading positions, a unit train staging area and loop tracks capable of holding five unit trains simultaneously. The terminal is also equipped with an onsite vapor management system that allows our customers to minimize hydrocarbon loss while improving safety during the loading process. Our Hardisty Terminal receives inbound deliveries of crude oil through a direct pipeline connection from Gibson Energy Inc.’s, or Gibson’s, Hardisty storage terminal. Gibson is one of the largest independent midstream companies in Canada with almost 14 MMbbls of crude oil storage facilities at Hardisty plus the greatest number of connections to inbound and outbound pipelines in the Hardisty hub. Our Hardisty Terminal’s strategic location and direct pipeline connection to substantial storage capacity provides efficient access to the major producers in the region. Our Hardisty Terminal is also connected to the Canadian Pacific Railway’s North Main Line, a high capacity line with the ability to service key refining markets across North America. 
We have a facilities connection agreement with Gibson under which Gibson operates and maintains a 24-inch diameter pipeline and related facilities connecting Gibson’s storage terminal with our Hardisty Terminal, which we operate and maintain. Gibson is responsible for transporting product through the pipeline to our Hardisty Terminal. This pipeline from Gibson’s storage terminal is the exclusive means by which our Hardisty Terminal receives crude oil. Subject to certain limited exceptions regarding manifest train facilities, our Hardisty Terminal is also the exclusive means by which crude oil from Gibson’s Hardisty storage terminal may be transported by rail. We remit pipeline fees to Gibson for the transportation of crude oil to the Hardisty Terminal based on a predetermined formula. The facilities connection agreement also gives Gibson a right of first refusal in the event of a sale of our Hardisty Terminal to a third party. The agreement will expire in 2034 unless renewed. Our and Gibson’s obligations under this facilities connection agreement may be suspended in the case of a force majeure event. Additionally, the agreement may be terminated by the non-defaulting party in case of specified events of default.
The combined contracted terminalling capacity at our Hardisty Terminal is contracted under multi-year, take-or-pay Terminal Services Agreements with four customers, including major integrated oil companies, refiners and marketers. Contracts representing approximately 26% of the combined Hardisty Terminal’s capacity expired in June 2022. Approximately 54% of the capacity is contracted through June 30, 2023 and approximately 31% is contracted through January 2024. Additionally, due to the successful commencement of USD’s DRU and Port Arthur Terminal, or PAT, projects discussed in more detail below, approximately 17% of the combined capacity of the Hardisty Terminal was contracted through mid-2031. 
Our Terminal Services Agreements generally include automatic renewal provisions for periods up to one-year following the conclusion of the initial term and will only terminate if written notice is given by either party within a specified time period before the end of the initial term or a renewal term. Some of our Terminal Services Agreements contain annual inflation-based rate escalators based upon the consumer price index of either Canada or Alberta. If a force majeure event occurs, a customer’s obligation to pay us may be suspended, in which case the length of the contract term will be extended by the same duration as the force majeure event. We will not be liable for any losses of crude oil handled at our Hardisty Terminal unless due to our negligence.
Under the Terminal Services Agreements we have entered into with customers of our Hardisty Terminal, our customers are obligated to pay the greater of a minimum monthly commitment fee or a throughput fee based on the actual volume of crude oil loaded at our Hardisty Terminal. If a customer loads fewer unit trains or barrels than its allotted amount in any given month, that customer will receive a credit for up to 12 months, which may be used to 
offset fees on throughput volumes in excess of its minimum monthly commitments in future periods, to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume.
Sponsor and USD’s Initiatives at Hardisty
USD’s Diluent Recovery Unit and Port Arthur Terminal 
In December 2019, USD and Gibson jointly announced an agreement and formed a 50%/50% joint venture to construct and operate a diluent recovery unit, or DRU, located adjacent to the Partnership’s Hardisty Terminal. A subsidiary of ConocoPhillips contracted to process 50,000 barrels per day of dilbit through the DRU to produce and ultimately ship bitumen by rail to USD’s newly constructed Port Arthur Terminal, or PAT, on the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
In December 2021, USD and Gibson jointly announced that the DRU has been declared fully operational and the shipment of DRUbit™ by Rail™, or DBR, has commenced. The DBR network creates a first-of-its-kind separation technology and network that safely and sustainably moves heavy Canadian crude oil, also known as bitumen, from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast at a cost that is competitive with pipeline alternatives. The DBR network is highly scalable and is well-positioned for future commercial expansions. USD and Gibson continue to pursue commercial discussions with current and potential producer and refiner customers to secure additional long-term agreements to support future expansions at both the DRU and the PAT.
USD’s patented DRU technology separates the diluent that is added to raw bitumen in the production process, which meets two important market needs. It creates DRUbit™, a proprietary heavy Canadian crude oil or bitumen that ships by rail and does not meet any of the defined categories of hazardous materials by U.S. DOT Hazardous Materials regulations and Canada’s Transport of Dangerous Goods regulations, creating safety and environmental benefits. Additionally, it returns the recovered diluent for reuse in the Western Canadian market, which reduces delivered costs for diluent. The DBR network provides meaningful safety, economic and environmental benefits relative to conventional crude by rail. The DBR network is supported by Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern Railway Company. As the initial destination terminal, PAT is unloading DRUbit™, blending it to customers’ specifications, and is currently delivering it downstream through pipe or barge at or above current contractual requirements. PAT has significant marine, pipeline, rail and tank expansion capabilities and it is pipeline connected to Phillips 66’s Beaumont Terminal, providing customers access to a large network of refining and marine facilities. We believe PAT has the infrastructure and ability to support growth, including allowing for efficient rail movements along mainlines from Canada and into the growing Mexico market, as discussed below.
Port Arthur Terminal
PAT has the capability for rail unloading, barge dock loading and unloading, tank storage and blending and is pipeline connected to Phillips 66’s Beaumont Terminal, providing customers access to a large network of refining and marine facilities. The facility can handle DRUbit™, Dilbit and a heavy Canadian conventional barrel and manage the blending of DRUbit™ into a marketable product for shippers. The marine and pipeline delivery options for blended products at the terminal allows customers to enhance market flexibility and take advantage of cost advantaged delivery options. PAT is served by the Kansas City Southern railroad and sits on exclusive rail infrastructure, providing seamless scheduling, operations, and communications resulting in ratable and reliable service. Within the 233-acre terminal footprint, there is ample waterfront and upland acreage that allows PAT expansion capabilities to accommodate any foreseeable demand.
We believe the PAT project is well positioned in a market poised for growth. The Port Arthur market is home to over 1.6 million barrels of refining capacity per the EIA and a growing petrochemical market. With ExxonMobil’s 250,000 barrel per day refinery expansion which is expected to be in service sometime in the first half of 2023, and Motiva’s acquisition of the Flint Hills ethane cracker dovetailing into planned downstream expansions into the petrochemical market, Port Arthur’s heavily utilized midstream infrastructure can expect liquid volumes to increase.
Within the Port Arthur market, PAT will be well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities and other organic growth projects. Pipeline connectivity to the hub of Port Arthur’s liquids business provides an advantage through reduced costs to deliver crude locally relative to a barge alternative and will extend the market reach for 
customers of PAT. Customers of PAT are able to deliver barrels by pipeline and water into the Houston and Louisiana markets.
Benefits to the Partnership
The successful completion of USD’s Hardisty DRU project enhanced the sustainability and quality of the Partnership’s cash flows by significantly increasing the average tenor of Terminal Services Agreements at our Hardisty Terminal. The average remaining terms of our three Terminal Services Agreements with ConocoPhillips at the combined Hardisty Terminal were extended through mid-2031, representing approximately 17% of the combined Hardisty Terminal’s capacity. We expect that future customers of the Hardisty DRU project will enter into similar long-term, more sustainable commitments for terminalling services at the Partnership’s Hardisty Terminal. USD’s interest in the Hardisty DRU and PAT projects would also be available for possible acquisition by the Partnership, and would be subject to the terms and conditions of the Partnership’s ROFO on USD’s assets pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement between USD and the Partnership, which extends through October 15, 2026.
Effective August 2021, the existing DRU customer elected to reduce its volume commitments at the Stroud Terminal attributable to the Partnership by one-third of the previous commitment through June 2022, at which point the agreement terminated and there was no renewal period. Management believes that the lower utilization at the Stroud Terminal as a result of successful completion of the DRU project will be short-term in nature, and will allow the Partnership the opportunity to offer terminalling services to other customers that may be in need of access to the numerous markets connected to the Cushing oil hub. If and to the extent we continue to be unable to replace our customer at the Stroud Terminal, our revenue, cash flows from operating activities and Adjusted EBITDA will be further materially adversely impacted. Refer to Growth Opportunities for our Operations - Other Opportunities Related to Our Crude Oil Terminal Network - Stroud Terminal included in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report for further details. Additionally, refer to Item 1A.Risk Factors of this Annual Report for further discussion of certain risks relating to our customer contract renewals. 
Stroud Terminal
Our Stroud Terminal, which we purchased in June 2017, is a crude oil destination terminal in Stroud, Oklahoma. We use the terminal to facilitate rail-to-pipeline shipments of crude oil from our Hardisty Terminal in Western Canada to the crude oil storage hub located in Cushing, Oklahoma. The Stroud Terminal includes 76-acres with current unit train unloading capacity of approximately 50,000 bpd, two onsite tanks with 140,000 barrels of capacity, one truck bay and a 12-inch diameter, 17-mile pipeline with a direct connection to the crude oil storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma. We have also secured 300,000 bbls of crude oil tank storage at the Cushing hub to facilitate outbound shipments of crude oil from the Stroud Terminal. Inbound product is delivered by the Stillwater Central Rail, which handles deliveries from both the BNSF Railway, or BNSF, and the Union Pacific Railroad, or UP.
Our Stroud Terminal is the only rail facility connected to the Cushing storage hub, which provides for strategic and competitive advantages. The benchmark price in the domestic spot market for U.S. crude oil known as West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, is set at the Cushing hub. According to the EIA, the Cushing storage hub has approximately 78 million barrels of working storage capacity. There is also an expansive pipeline infrastructure that connects into and out of the Cushing hub. Because of the vast connectivity that Cushing offers, crude oil that is delivered into Cushing can then be delivered to either local refineries or it can be shipped to other markets such as the United States Gulf Coast, which is the largest refinery complex in the U.S. As such, we believe our Stroud Terminal provides an advantageous rail destination for Western Canadian crude oil given the optionality provided by its connectivity to the Cushing hub and multiple refining centers across the United States.
We own 50% of the Stroud Terminal’s current capacity. USD Marketing LLC, or USDM, a wholly-owned subsidiary of USDG, owns the rights to the other 50% of the Stroud Terminal’s current capacity, pursuant to the Marketing Services Agreement, or MSA, that we entered into in May 2017 at the time of the acquisition of the terminal. Under the MSA, we granted USDM the right to market the capacity at the Stroud Terminal in excess of the original capacity of our initial customer in exchange for a nominal per barrel fee. USDM is obligated to fund any related capital costs associated with increasing the throughput or efficiency of the terminal to handle additional 
throughput. Upon expiration of our contract with the initial Stroud customer in June 2020, the same marketing rights now apply to all throughput at the Stroud Terminal in excess of the throughput necessary for the Stroud Terminal to generate adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Adjusted EBITDA, that is at least equal to the average monthly Adjusted EBITDA derived from the initial Stroud customer during the 12 months prior to expiration. We also granted USDG the right to develop other projects at the Stroud Terminal in exchange for the payment to us of market-based compensation for the use of our property for such development projects. The capacity attributable to USDM is currently not under any contracted agreements.
To facilitate marketing the capacity that is currently available at the Stroud Terminal, USDM has expanded the downstream connectivity at our Stroud Terminal and added a pipeline connection to a second storage tank at a third-party facility at the Cushing, Oklahoma crude oil hub, or the Cushing Hub. The expanded connectivity facilitates incremental rail-to-pipeline shipments of crude oil to the Cushing Hub by giving the Stroud Terminal better capability to service multiple customers and/or grades of crude oil simultaneously including the unloading of multiple grades of dilbit. Additionally, this development project is wholly-owned by USDG and is subject to the terms and conditions of our existing ROFO, should USDG propose to sell or transfer the asset.
Casper Terminal
The Casper Terminal, which we acquired in November 2015, is a crude oil storage, blending and railcar loading terminal located in Casper, Wyoming, where the Express pipeline from Western Canada (~280,000 bpd of capacity) interconnects with the Platte Pipeline to Wood River, Illinois (~145,000 bpd of capacity). The Casper Terminal currently offers six storage tanks with 900,000 bbls of total capacity, unit train-capable railcar loading capacity in excess of 100,000 bpd, as well as truck transloading capacity. The terminal’s approximately 300-acre footprint and modular design allow for the addition of a second loading station and an additional 1.1 MMbbls of storage capacity with minimal disruption to existing operations and relatively low incremental capital costs.
Inbound crude oil is delivered to the Casper Terminal primarily through our dedicated 24-inch diameter, six-mile direct pipeline connection from the Express pipeline, which provides our customers with access to multiple grades of Canadian crude oil. Additionally, the Casper Terminal has a connection from the Platte Terminal, where it has access to other pipelines and can receive other grades of crude oil, including locally sourced Wyoming sour crude oil. The Casper Terminal can also receive volumes through one truck unloading station and is also equipped with one truck loading station. Inbound volumes are typically fed directly into the customer’s dedicated storage tank(s), which enhances their ability to control the quality of the product from origin to end market. This also allows customers to blend multiple grades of crude oil to optimize the economics associated with refining varying grades of crude oil.
Outbound crude oil from our Casper Terminal is loaded onto railcars and is then transported to end markets by BNSF, in either manifest or unit train shipments. The terminal’s location on BNSF’s main line offers advantageous transportation costs to key U.S. refining markets where several customer-preferred destinations are also served by BNSF. Shipping with a single Class 1 railroad reduces railroad switching fees and enables faster train turn-times, thus improving railcar fleet utilization. Additionally, to supplement the rail loading options from the terminal, we constructed an outbound pipeline connection from the Casper Terminal to the nearby Platte Terminal located at the termination point of the Express pipeline that was placed into service in December 2019.
We provide service at the Casper Terminal under a Terminal Services Agreement with a midstream customer. The agreement contains take-or-pay terms for storage services and variable fees associated with actual throughput volumes and other services. Additionally, we are currently utilizing our available storage and throughput capacity to support our customers’ spot activity through buy-sell agreements that generate cash flows in addition to those provided by our agreements.
West Colton Terminal
Our West Colton Terminal, which was initially completed in November 2009, is a unit train-capable destination terminal that can transload up to 13,000 bpd of ethanol and renewable diesel received from producers by rail onto trucks to meet local demand in the San Bernardino and Riverside County-Inland Empire region of Southern California. During 2021, we completed a modification project at our West Colton Terminal so that it has the 
capability to transload renewable diesel in addition to the ethanol that it is was initially capable of transloading. The West Colton Terminal has 20 railcar offloading positions and four truck loading positions. Our terminal receives inbound deliveries exclusively by rail on the UP high speed lines.
Ethanol Transloading
We receive fixed fees per gallon of ethanol transloaded at our terminal pursuant to a Terminal Services Agreement with one of the world’s largest producers of biofuels. Effective January 2022, we entered into a new five-year agreement with the existing West Colton ethanol customer that has a minimum monthly throughput commitment. This new agreement replaced the previous short-term agreement at the terminal that had been in place since July 2009 and is expected to add incremental “Net Cash from Operating Activities” over the previous agreement, subject to changes in expected throughput. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results of this Annual Report for further information. Under this new agreement, our customer is obligated to pay the greater of a minimum monthly commitment fee or a throughput fee based on the actual volume of ethanol loaded at our West Colton Terminal. If the customer loads fewer volumes than its allotted amount in any given month, that customer will receive a credit for up to six months, which may be used to offset fees on throughput volumes in excess of its minimum monthly commitments in future periods, to the extent capacity is available for the excess volume.
Due to corrosion concerns unique to biofuels such as ethanol, the long-haul transportation of biofuels by multi-product pipelines is less efficient and less economical than transportation by rail. We believe these corrosion concerns, combined with the proximity of our terminals to local demand markets, strategically position our terminal to benefit from anticipated changes in environmental and gasoline blending regulations that are expected to increase the use of ethanol in the market for transportation fuel.
Renewable Diesel Transloading
In June 2021, we entered into a new Terminal Services Agreement with USD Clean Fuels LLC, or USDCF, a subsidiary of USD, that is supported by a minimum throughput commitment to USDCF from an investment-grade rated, refining customer as well as a performance guaranty from USD. The Terminal Services Agreement provides for the inbound shipment of renewable diesel on rail at our West Colton Terminal and the outbound shipment of the product on tank trucks to local consumers. The new Terminal Services Agreement has an initial term of five years and commenced on December 1, 2021.
In exchange for the new Terminal Services Agreement at our West Colton Terminal with USDCF discussed above, we also entered into a Marketing Services Agreement with USDCF in June 2021, or the West Colton MSA, pursuant to which we agreed to grant USDCF marketing and development rights pertaining to future renewable diesel opportunities associated with the West Colton Terminal in excess of the Terminal Services Agreement with USDCF discussed above. Refer to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13. Transactions with Related Parties of this Annual Report for further information.
For more information on USDCF, refer to Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Growth Opportunities for our Operations, Opportunities Related to Clean Energy Transportation Fuels, USD Clean Fuels of this Annual Report.
Fleet Services
We provide one of our customers with leased railcars and fleet services related to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons by rail on a take-or-pay basis under a master fleet services agreement. We do not own any railcars. As of December 31, 2022, our railcar fleet consisted of 200 railcars, which we lease from a railcar manufacturer, all of which are coiled and insulated, or C&I, railcars. Our C&I railcars can reheat heavy viscous grades of crude oil, reducing the need to blend these heavier grades with diluents. Our master fleet services agreement has a remaining contract life of six months as of December 31, 2022.
Under the master fleet services agreement, we provide a customer with railcar-specific fleet services, which may include, among other things, the provision of relevant administrative and billing services, the repair and 
maintenance of railcars in accordance with standard industry practice and applicable law, the management and tracking of the movement of railcars, the regulatory and administrative reporting and compliance as required in connection with the movement of railcars, and the negotiation for and sourcing of railcars. Our customer typically pays us and our assignees monthly fees per railcar for these services, which include a component for fleet services.
All of our railcars currently in service were constructed in 2013 or later. The average age of our fleet currently in service is nine years, as compared with the estimated 50-year life associated with these types of railcars. Our current railcars are designed at a minimum to be compliant with all regulatory railcar standards currently in effect. We have partnered with leaders in the railcar supply industry, such as CIT Rail, Union Tank Car Company and others. We believe that our relationships with these industry leaders enable us to obtain railcar market insight and to procure railcars for our terminalling customers on beneficial terms, with shorter lead times than some of our competitors. 
Historically we have assisted our customers with procuring railcars to facilitate their use of our terminalling services. Our wholly-owned subsidiary USD Rail LP has historically entered into leases with third-party manufacturers of railcars and financial firms, which it has then leased to customers. Although we expect to continue to assist our customers in obtaining railcars for their use transporting crude oil to or from our terminals, we do not intend to continue to act as an intermediary between railcar lessors and our customers as our existing lease agreement expires. Should market conditions change, we could potentially act as an intermediary with railcar lessors on behalf of our customers again in the future.
BENEFITS OF RAIL
We believe that the following benefits of rail have established, or have the potential to establish, rail as a preferred mode of transportation for crude oil, biofuels, and other energy-related products:
Market access for areas without adequate pipeline transportation infrastructure. Certain producing regions, such as the Western Canadian oil sands, have concentrated production in areas without adequate existing pipeline takeaway capacity. The extensive existing rail infrastructure network provides additional takeaway capacity for these producing regions and flexible access to multiple demand centers.
Faster deployment. Rail terminals can be constructed at a fraction of the time required to lay a long-haul pipeline, providing a timely solution to meet new and evolving market demands. Relative to rail, new pipeline construction faces challenges such as lengthier build times and more extensive environmental permitting processes, geographic constraints and, in some cases, the lack of required political and regulatory support.
Flexibility to deliver to different end markets. Unlike pipelines, which typically transport product to a single demand market, rail offers customers access to many of the most advantageous demand centers throughout North America, enabling producers and shippers to obtain competitive prices for their products and to retain the flexibility to determine the ultimate destination until the time of transportation.
Comprehensive solution for refiners. Rail provides refiners flexible access to multiple qualities and grades of crude oil (feedstock) from multiple production sources. Additionally, shipping in railcars improves the customer’s ability to preserve the specific quality of the product over long distances relative to pipelines.
Faster delivery to demand markets. Rail can transport energy-related products to end markets much faster than pipelines, trucks or waterborne tankers. While a pipeline can take 30-45 days to transport crude oil to the Gulf Coast from Western Canada, unit trains can move crude oil along a similar path in approximately nine days.
Reduced shipper commitment requirements. Whereas all of the pipeline transportation fee is typically subject to long-term shipper commitments, only a portion of rail transportation costs require long-term shipper commitments (railroads have historically been contracted on a spot basis or only require partial term commitments). Consequently, pipeline customers bear greater risk of shifts in regional price differentials and the location of demand markets.
Reduced shipper transportation cost. Rail provides shippers a competitive transportation option, particularly in situations where either (i) the amount of diluent required for the transportation of crude oil by pipeline is high, which is generally the case for production from the Canadian oil sands, or (ii) multiple modes of transportation are required to reach a particular end market.
RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER
In October 2014, we entered into the Omnibus Agreement with USD and USDG, pursuant to which we were granted a ROFO on any midstream infrastructure assets that they may develop, construct, or acquire for a period of seven years. In June 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement with USD, USDG and certain other of their subsidiaries, which amends and restates the Omnibus Agreement, dated October 15, 2014, to extend the termination date of the ROFO period, as defined in the Omnibus Agreement, by an additional five years such that the ROFO Period will terminate on October 15, 2026 unless a Partnership Change of Control, as defined in the Omnibus Agreement, occurs prior to such date. Additional information about the Omnibus Agreement and the ROFO are included in Note 13. Transactions with Related Parties of our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report.
USD has not engaged in any transactions that trigger our ROFO. We cannot assure you that USD will be able to develop or construct, or that we or USD will be able to acquire, any additional midstream infrastructure projects. Among other things, the ability of USD to further develop the Stroud Terminal, the DRU project, or any other project, and our ability to acquire such projects, will depend upon USD’s and our ability to raise additional equity and debt financing. We are under no obligation to make any offer, and USD and USDG are under no obligation to accept any offer we make, with respect to any asset subject to our ROFO. Additionally, the approval of Energy Capital Partners is required for the sale of any assets by USD or its subsidiaries, including us (other than sales in the ordinary course of business), acquisitions of securities of other entities that exceed specified materiality thresholds and any material unbudgeted expenditures or deviations from our approved budgets. Energy Capital Partners may make these decisions free of any duty to us and our unitholders. This approval would be required for the potential acquisition by us of any of USD’s projects, as well as any other projects or assets that USD may develop or acquire in the future or any third-party acquisition we may pursue independently or jointly with USD. Energy Capital Partners is under no obligation to approve any such transaction. Please refer to the discussion in Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance — Special Approval Rights of Energy Capital Partners of this Annual Report regarding the rights of Energy Capital Partners. If we are unable to acquire any projects to expand the Stroud Terminal from USD, such expansions may compete directly with our existing business for future throughput volumes, which may impact our ability to enter into new Terminal Services Agreements, including with our existing customers, following the expiration of our existing agreements, or the terms thereof, and our ability to compete for future spot volumes. Furthermore, cyclical changes in the demand for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons may cause USD, or us, to further re-evaluate any future expansion projects, including expansion of the Stroud Terminal.
COMPETITION
The energy-related logistics infrastructure business is highly competitive. The ability to secure additional agreements for rail terminal services is primarily based on the availability of alternative means of transportation, primarily pipelines, as well as the reputation, efficiency, flexibility, location, market economics and reliability of the services provided and pricing for those services.
Our crude oil terminals face competition from other logistics services providers, such as pipelines and other terminalling service providers. In addition, our customers may also choose to construct or acquire their own terminals. If our customers choose to ship crude oil via alternative means, we may only receive the minimum monthly commitment fees at our terminals and may be unable to renew, extend or replace customer agreements following expiration of their terms. Our West Colton Terminal business faces competition from other terminals and trucks that may be able to supply end-user markets with ethanol and other biofuels on a more competitive basis due to terminal location, price, rail rates, versatility or services provided. Additionally, our West Colton Terminal business faces competition from waterborne imports including ethanol imports from Brazil as well as domestic waterborne renewable diesel volumes delivered to California from the U.S. Gulf Coast. The West Colton Terminal 
is served by the UP and competes directly with ethanol facilities in the Fontana, Carson and San Diego areas, which are served by the BNSF Railway. A combination of rail freight and trucking economics, which comprise the largest share of the value chain, make it very difficult to compete with other facilities in this market based on terminalling throughput fees alone.
We believe that we are favorably positioned to compete in our industry due to the strategic location of our terminals, quality of service provided at our terminals, our independent strategy, our reputation and industry relationships, and the versatility and complementary nature of our services. The competitiveness of our service offerings could be significantly impacted by the entry of new competitors into the markets in which we operate. However, we believe that significant barriers to entry exist in the energy-related logistics business. These barriers include significant costs and execution risk, a lengthy permitting and development cycle, financing challenges, shortage of personnel with the requisite expertise, and a finite number of sites suitable for development.
SEASONALITY
The amount of throughput at our terminals is affected by the level of supply and demand for crude oil, refined products and biofuels, as well as, to a lesser extent, seasonality. Demand for gasoline is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction work. Production in Western Canada may be impeded by severe winter conditions that reduce production and volumes. However, many effects of seasonality on our revenues are substantially mitigated due to our terminal service agreements with our customers that include minimum monthly commitment fees, as well as our master fleet services agreement which requires our customer to pay a base monthly fee per railcar. Furthermore, because there are multiple end markets for the crude oil and biofuels handled at our terminals, the effect of seasonality otherwise attributable to one particular end market is mitigated.
IMPACT OF REGULATION 
General 
Our operations are subject to complex and frequently-changing federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of health, property and the environment, including laws and regulations that govern the handling and release of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbon materials. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental and safety laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate, and upgrade equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations may affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income or loss, customers typically place additional value on utilizing established and reputable third-party providers to satisfy their terminal and logistics needs. As a result, we expect increased regulations to provide opportunities for us to increase our market share in relation to customer-owned operations or smaller operators that lack an established track record of safety and environmental compliance.
Violations of environmental or safety laws or regulations can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties, permit modifications or revocations, and in some instances, operational interruptions or injunctions banning or delaying certain activities. We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change at the federal, state, provincial and local levels, and the legislative and regulatory trend has been to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment.
Our operations contain risks of accidental releases into the environment, such as releases of crude oil, ethanol or hazardous substances from our terminals. To the extent an event is not covered by our insurance policies, such accidental releases could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage, and fines or penalties for any related violations of environmental or safety laws or regulations.
Air Emissions 
Our operations are subject to and affected by the Clean Air Act, or CAA, and its implementing regulations, as well as comparable state and local statutes and regulations. Our operations are subject to the CAA’s permitting 
requirements and related emission control requirements relating to specific air pollutants, as well as the requirement to maintain a risk management program to help prevent accidental releases of certain regulated substances. We are currently required to obtain and maintain various construction and operating permits under the CAA and have incurred capital expenditures to maintain compliance with all applicable federal and state laws regarding air emissions. We may, nonetheless, be required to incur additional capital expenditures in the near future for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at our terminals when regulations change, when we add new equipment, or when we modify our existing equipment. Our Canadian operations are similarly subject to federal and provincial air emission regulations.
Our customers are also subject to, and similarly affected by, environmental regulations restricting air emissions. These include U.S. and Canadian federal and state or provincial actions to develop programs for the reduction of greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions such as proposals to create a cap-and-trade system that would require companies to purchase carbon dioxide emission allowances for emissions at manufacturing facilities and emissions caused by the use of the fuels sold. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and the federal Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, has begun to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and other GHGs. As a result of these regulations, our customers could be required to undertake significant capital expenditures, operate at reduced levels, and/or pay significant penalties. These regulations’ impact on our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers could result in a decreased demand for the services that we provide. We are uncertain what our customers’ responses to these emerging issues will be. Those responses could reduce throughput at our terminals, as well as impact our cash flows and our ability to make distributions or satisfy debt obligations.
Climate Change 
Following its December 2009 “endangerment finding” that GHG emissions pose a threat to public health and welfare, the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, has begun to regulate GHG emissions under the authority granted to it by the federal CAA. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal CAA that require Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, pre-construction permits and Title V operating permits for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Under these regulations, certain facilities required to obtain PSD permits must meet “best available control technology” standards for their GHG emissions established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore oil and natural gas processing and fractionating facilities and onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting activities as well as natural gas transmission pipelines. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all GHG emissions permitting and reporting requirements applicable to our operations.
In response to studies suggesting that emissions of CO2, methane and certain other gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere, over 190 countries, including the United States and Canada where we operate, committed to a legally binding treaty to reduce GHG emissions, the terms of which were defined at the Paris climate conference in December 2015. President Biden and the Democratic Party, which has controlled Congress for the past two years, have identified climate change as a priority, and it is likely that new executive orders, regulatory action, and/or legislation targeting greenhouse gas emissions, or prohibiting, delaying or restricting oil and gas development activities in certain areas, will be proposed and/or promulgated during the Biden Administration. With the next Congress set to have a Republican-controlled House of Representatives, the prospects for additional federal legislation have dimmed significantly. However, the Biden administration likely will continue to proceed with executive and regulatory action.
During the first half of President Biden’s administration, Congress and the Executive branch have issued actions to address greenhouse gas emissions and oil and gas development. For example, in 2021 the EPA proposed updated Clean Air Act performance standards governing methane emissions from new and existing sources in the oil and gas sector. In 2022, EPA issued a supplemental notice proposing to increase emissions standards beyond the 2021 notice of proposed rulemaking and proposing requirements for additional sources not covered by the 2021 notice. Additionally, the Department of the Interior, or DOI, issued an order preventing staff from producing any new fossil fuel leases or permits without sign-off from a top political appointee, and President Biden issued a 
“pause” on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. The leasing pause was challenged and was preliminarily enjoined by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. DOI resumed holding lease sales in compliance with the district’s court order. The United States appealed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the preliminary injunction and remanded the case. On remand, the District Court issued a permanent injunction against the United States, preventing it from implementing the “pause pending further proceedings in the case. The DOI continues to hold lease sales in accordance with the injunction and the Inflation Reduction Act, subject to certain other court orders. DOI also issued a report on the federal oil and gas leasing program indicating that the Department would increase royalty and bonding rates, prioritize leases in areas with known resource potential, and avoid issuing leases where they may conflict with recreation, wildlife habitat, conservation efforts, and historical and cultural resources. Finally, DOI recently announced a proposed rule from the Bureau of Land Management to reduce methane releases from venting, and leaks from oil and gas production on public and tribal land.
Congress recently passed, and the President signed, the Inflation Reduction Act, which included spending provisions and voluntary programs focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Congress allocated billions of dollars for renewable energy production and grid energy storage, electric vehicle incentives, reducing carbon emissions in the industrial and transportation sectors, and reducing methane emissions from the production and transportation of natural gas, among other programs. 
The Supreme Court recently issued West Virginia v. EPA, or West Virginia, a significant decision curtailing agency authority to enact sweeping regulations without clear statutory authorization. In 2015, EPA issued the Clean Power Plan, which required coal and gas power plants either to reduce their production of electricity or to offset their production by subsidizing the generation of natural gas, wind, or solar energy. The issue in West Virginia was whether the Clean Air Act empowered EPA to transform the electric generation sector through the Clean Power Plan. The Court held that Congress had not delegated broad authority to EPA under the Clean Air Act to restructure the energy industry by requiring existing power plants to shift to different forms of energy production. In doing so, the Court reaffirmed the principle that agency action with vast economic and political significance requires a clear delegation from Congress. The Court’s application of the “major questions doctrine” indicates its commitment to limiting executive agencies’ regulation of particularly significant matters to circumstances where Congress clearly delegated such regulatory authority to the agency. The Court’s decision makes it much more difficult for agencies to justify extraordinary and far-reaching regulatory initiatives. 
 President Biden’s executive order also established climate change as a primary foreign policy and national security consideration, affirms that achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by or before mid-century is a critical priority, affirms President Biden’s desire to establish the United States as a leader in addressing climate change generally, further integrates climate change and environmental justice considerations into government agencies’ decision making, and eliminates fossil fuel subsidies, among other measures. Additionally, some U.S. states are taking measures to reduce GHG emissions. For example, a coalition of over 20 governors of U.S. states formed the United States Climate Alliance to advance the objectives of the Paris treaty, and several U.S. cities have committed to advance the objectives of the Paris treaty at the state or local level. Increased costs associated with compliance with any future legislation or regulation of GHG emissions, if it occurs, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, climate change legislation and regulations may result in increased costs not only for our business but also for our customers, thereby potentially decreasing demand for our services. Decreased demand for our services may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Finally, many scientists believe that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere produce climate changes that can have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods, as well as other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, it is uncertain if they would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Waste Management and Related Liabilities 
To a large extent, the environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into soils, groundwater, and surface water, and include measures to control 
pollution of the environment. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. They also require corrective action, including investigation and remediation, at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed.
Site Remediation.    The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or to the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons regarding the presence or release of a “hazardous substance” in (or into) the environment. Those persons include the former and present owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and the transporters and generators of the hazardous substance found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances and for damages to natural resources. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties, to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. Claims filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment are not uncommon from neighboring landowners and other third parties. Petroleum products are typically excluded from CERCLA’s definition of “hazardous substances.” In the ordinary course of operating our business, we do not handle wastes that are designated as hazardous substances and, as a result, we have limited exposure under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have been released into the environment. Costs for any such remedial actions, as well as any related claims, could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses to the extent not covered by insurance. Canadian and provincial laws also impose liabilities for releases of certain substances into the environment.
We also currently own or lease properties where hydrocarbons are currently handled or have been handled for many years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, and comparable state and Canadian federal and provincial laws and regulations. Under these laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We have not been identified by any state or federal agency as a Potentially Responsible Party under CERCLA in connection with the transport and/or disposal of any waste products to third-party disposal sites. 
We maintain insurance of various types with varying levels of coverage that we consider adequate under the circumstances to cover our operations and properties. Our insurance policies are subject to deductibles and retention levels that we consider reasonable and not excessive. Consistent with insurance coverage generally available in the industry, in certain circumstances our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to certain pollution events, including gradual pollution or sudden and accidental occurrences.
Solid and Hazardous Wastes.    Our operations generate solid wastes, including some hazardous wastes, which are subject to the requirements of RCRA and analogous state and Canadian federal and provincial laws that impose requirements on the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes. Many of the wastes that we generate are not subject to the most stringent requirements of RCRA because our operations generate primarily oil and gas wastes, which currently are excluded from consideration as RCRA hazardous wastes. EPA has excluded from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA produced waters and other wastes intrinsically associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil and natural gas. However, these oil and gas exploration and production wastes may still be regulated under state solid waste laws and regulations. Oil and gas wastes may be included as hazardous wastes under RCRA in the future, in which event our wastes as well as the wastes of our competitors will be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements, resulting in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses.
Water 
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, or CWA, and analogous state and Canadian federal and provincial laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters of the United States or into any type of water body in Canada, as well as state and provincial waters. Federal, state and provincial regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and comparable laws, in addition to requiring remedial action to clean up such water body and surrounding land. 
The regulatory scope of the CWA has been in flux since 2015. In June 2015, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers, or Corps, revised the definition of “waters of the United States,” or WOTUS, in a manner which was widely viewed as expanding the jurisdictional reach of all Clean Water Act programs. The 2015 rule was the subject of litigation and various injunctions and never took effect nationwide. In 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia and the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas each held the 2015 rule to be unlawful and remanded the rule to the agencies. In September 2019, the EPA and the Corps repealed this rule and in January 2020 finalized a revised WOTUS definition. The revised definition became effective in June 2020. The 2020 rule was the subject of litigation and was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona in August 2021 and the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico in September 2021. The EPA and the Corps currently are implementing the pre-2015 regulatory regime and have proposed to formally repeal the 2020 rule. The agencies have also indicated that they still intend to propose a wholly new definition of WOTUS, that takes into account stakeholder engagement and the experiences implementing the pre-2015 rule, the Obama-era Clean Water Rule, and the Trump-era Navigable Waters Protection Rule. Such proposed definition is likely to share similarities with the more-expansive definition from the 2015 rule.
The regulatory scope of the Clean Water Act, including any future new definition, will likely be influenced by the Supreme Court’s upcoming decision in Sackett v. EPA, concerning whether the CWA’s scope reaches certain wetlands deemed adjacent to a traditional navigable water or other water of the United States. The Supreme Court will decide the appropriate test for determining whether wetlands are “waters of the United States” under the CWA. The Court heard oral argument in October 2022, and a decision is expected by June 2023.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, amended certain provisions of the CWA, as they relate to the release of petroleum products into navigable waters. OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict, joint and potentially unlimited liability for containment and removal costs, natural resource damages, and certain other consequences of an oil spill. These laws impose regulatory burdens on our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable OPA requirements. State and Canadian federal and provincial laws also impose requirements relating to the prevention of oil releases and the remediation of areas affected by releases when they occur. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all such federal, state and Canadian requirements.
Endangered Species Act 
The Endangered Species Act, or ESA, restricts activities that may affect endangered species or their habitats. While some of our facilities are in areas that may be designated as habitat for endangered species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the Endangered Species Act. However, the discovery of previously unidentified endangered species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected area. Similar protections are in place for bald and golden eagles under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and for migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. DOI and the Department of Commerce have announced their intent to repeal regulations finalized during the Trump Administration that narrowed the definition of “habitat” under the ESA, set out the process for determining exclusions from critical habitat designations, and removed a provision stating that listing determinations are made without reference to possible economic or other impacts of such determination. As of June 2022, DOI has proposed a rule removing language from the regulations that restricts the introduction of experimental populations to only the species’ “historical range” to allow for the introduction of populations into habitats outside of their historical range for conservation purposes. This proposed rule would expand the definition of “habitat” under the ESA. The public comment period closed in August 2022.
Rail Safety
We facilitate the transport of crude oil and related products by rail in the United States and Canada. We do not own or operate the railroads on which crude oil carrying railcars are transported; however, we currently lease or manage a railcar fleet on behalf of one of our customers. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to regulations governing railcar design and manufacture, and increasingly stringent regulations pertaining to the shipment of crude
oil by rail. 
High-profile accidents involving crude oil unit trains in Quebec, North Dakota, Virginia, West Virginia and Illinois have raised concerns about the environmental and safety risks associated with transporting crude oil by rail, and the associated risks arising from railcar design. 
In May 2015, the DOT, in coordination with Transport Canada, finalized new rail safety rules. The final rule includes more stringent and new construction standards for rail tank cars constructed after October 1, 2015. The final rule also creates a new North American tank car standard known as the DOT Specification 117 (DOT-117) with thicker steel and redesigned bottom outlet valves, among other improvements, over the DOT-111 tank car. In addition, the final rule includes mandates for using electronically controlled pneumatic braking systems and for performing routing analyses and imposes speed limits based on population centers, age of tank cars and types of petroleum-based products. 
In February 2019, PHMSA, in cooperation with the Federal Railroad Association, issued a final rule that requires railroads to develop and submit Comprehensive Oil Spill Response Plans for route segments traveled by High Hazard Flammable Trains, or HHFTs. 
In subsequent years there have been additional modifications to these regulations and we continuously monitor the railcar regulatory landscape and remain in close contact with railcar suppliers and other industry stakeholders to stay informed of railcar regulation rulemaking developments. Given the current railcar design compliance requirements and timelines outlined in the most recent Transport Canada and DOT rules, we do not anticipate a material impact to our ability to transport crude oil under our existing contracts. If future rulemakings result in more stringent design requirements and compressed compliance timelines, then our ability to transport these volumes could be affected by a delay in the railcar industry’s ability to provide adequate railcar modification repair services. Our customers may not have access to a sufficient number of compliant cars to transport the required volumes under our existing contracts. This may lead to a decrease in revenues and other consequences. DOT and Transport Canada have also required operators to take certain precautions relating to rail routing, and mandated reductions in train speed and the implementation of new braking technology, to address rail safety concerns. 
 Certain of the railroads serving our terminals have in the past and are currently considering imposing tariffs, fees or other limitations on the utilization of older railcar designs. These tariffs, fees and limitations could have the effect of imposing limits on the use of railcars that are more stringent than current regulatory standards, and could reduce the size of the overall railcar fleet available to be loaded at our terminals and increase the costs of obtaining usable railcars. Similar to other industry participants, compliance with existing and any additional environmental laws and regulations, or the imposition of additional tariffs, fees or limitations on the transportation of crude oil in certain railcars or all railcars by the railroads, could increase our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate and upgrade equipment and facilities, or the costs of our customers, which may reduce the attractiveness of rail transportation and limit our ability to extend existing agreements or attract new customers. Our master fleet services agreement generally obligates our customer to pay for modifications and other
required repairs to our leased and managed railcar fleet. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully pass all such regulatory costs on to our customer.
The adoption of additional federal, state, provincial or local laws or regulations, including any voluntary measures by the rail industry regarding railcar design or crude oil and liquid hydrocarbon rail transport activities, or efforts by local communities to restrict or limit rail traffic involving crude oil, could affect our business by increasing compliance costs and decreasing demand for our services, which could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows.
Crude Oil Pipeline Safety
In connection with our acquisition of the Casper Terminal and Stroud Terminal and related facilities, we became subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, the DOT through PHMSA, as well as other federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the operation of our dedicated crude oil pipelines, rates charged for transportation service, and protection of health, property and the environment. The transportation and storage of crude oil and refined petroleum products involve a risk that hazardous liquids may be released into the environment, potentially causing harm to the public or the environment. In turn, such incidents may result in substantial expenditures for response actions, significant government penalties, liability to government agencies for natural resources damages, and significant business interruption. DOT has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of our crude oil pipeline and related assets. These regulations contain requirements for the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and necessary maintenance or repairs. These regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans.
We are subject to regulation by the DOT under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, or the HLPSA. The HLPSA delegated to DOT the authority to develop, prescribe, and enforce minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline. Congress also enacted the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, or the PSA, which added the environment to the list of statutory factors that must be considered in establishing safety standards for hazardous liquid pipelines, required that regulations be issued to define the term “gathering line” and that safety standards for certain “regulated gathering lines” be established, and mandated that regulations be issued to establish criteria for operators to use in identifying and inspecting pipelines located in High Consequence Areas, or HCAs, defined as those areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage, that cross a navigable waterway, or that have a high population density. In 1996, Congress enacted the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act, or the APSPA, which limited the operator identification requirement mandate to pipelines that cross a waterway where a substantial likelihood of commercial navigation exists, required that certain areas where a pipeline rupture would likely cause permanent or long-term environmental damage be considered in determining whether an area is unusually sensitive to environmental damage, and mandated that regulations be issued for the qualification and testing of certain pipeline personnel. In the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006, or the PIPES Act, Congress required mandatory inspections for certain U.S. crude oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in HCAs and mandated that regulations be issued for low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines and pipeline control room management. We are also subject to the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, which reauthorized funding for federal pipeline safety programs through 2015, increased penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines, and required studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. The Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 reauthorized the federal pipeline safety programs of PHMSA through September 2019. The Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020 was passed in December 2020 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, appropriating funds through 2023.
PHMSA administers compliance with these statutes and has promulgated comprehensive safety standards and regulations for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline, including regulations for the design and construction of new pipeline systems or those that have been relocated, replaced or otherwise changed; pressure testing of new pipelines; operation and maintenance of pipeline systems, establishing programs for public awareness and damage prevention, and managing the operation of pipeline control rooms; protection of steel pipelines from the adverse effects of internal and external corrosion; and integrity management requirements for pipelines in HCAs. PHMSA published its final safety standards for hazardous liquid pipelines, as well as rules for gas transmission pipelines, including maximum allowable operating pressure reconfirmation (for pipelines constructed before 1970) and records rules in October 2019, which became effective July 1, 2020. Also in September 2019, PHMSA finalized enhanced emergency order procedures allowing the agency to issue an emergency order which may impose emergency restrictions, prohibitions, or other safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities. In August 2022, PHMSA issued a final rule revising the Federal Pipeline Safety Regulations. The rule clarifies integrity management provisions, increases gas transmission pipeline corrosion control requirements, 
requires operators to inspect pipelines following extreme weather events, strengthens integrity management assessment requirements, adjusts the repair criteria for high-consequence areas, creates new repair criteria for non-high consequence areas, and revises related definitions. The rule takes effect on May 23, 2023.
We monitor the structural integrity of our pipeline system through a program of periodic internal assessments using high resolution internal inspection tools, as well as hydrostatic testing and direct assessment that conforms to federal standards. We accompany these assessments with a review of the data and repair anomalies, as required, to ensure the integrity of the pipeline. We then utilize sophisticated risk algorithms and a comprehensive data integration effort to ensure that the greatest risk areas receive the highest priority for scheduling subsequent integrity assessments. We use external coatings and impressed current cathodic protection systems to protect against external corrosion. We conduct all cathodic protection work in accordance with National Association of Corrosion Engineers standards. We continually monitor, test, and record the effectiveness of these corrosion inhibiting systems.
Crude Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation
The rates we charge for use of our dedicated crude oil pipeline are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. FERC regulates the transportation of crude oil on our dedicated Casper and Stroud pipelines under the Interstate Commerce Act, or ICA, Energy Policy Act of 1992, or EPAct 1992, and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. FERC regulations require that rates charged by pipelines that provide transport services in interstate or foreign commerce for crude oil and refined petroleum products, or collectively referred to as petroleum pipelines, and certain other liquids be just and reasonable, not unduly discriminatory, and not confer any undue preference upon any shipper. FERC regulations also require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their transportation rates and terms and conditions of service. Under the ICA, FERC or interested persons may challenge existing or changed rates or services. FERC is authorized to investigate such charges and may suspend the effectiveness of a new rate for up to seven months. A successful rate challenge could result in a common carrier paying refunds together with interest for the period that the rate was in effect. FERC may also order a pipeline to change its rates and may require a common carrier to pay shippers reparations for damages sustained for a period up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint.
EPAct 1992 required FERC to establish a simplified and generally applicable methodology to adjust tariff rates for inflation for interstate petroleum pipelines. As a result, FERC adopted an indexing rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows common carriers to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, or PPIFG. FERC’s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. In December 2020, FERC issued an order setting the index level for the period beginning July 1, 2021 for annual changes equal to the change in PPIFG plus 0.78%. Upon rehearing, FERC issued an order on January 20, 2022 revising downward this index level to PPIFG minus 0.21%. As a result, pipelines that have adjusted their transportation rates on an indexed basis upward since July 2021 were required to decrease those rates to a level at or below the new, lower index ceiling by March 1, 2022. The indexing methodology is applicable to existing rates, including grandfathered rates, with the exclusion of market-based rates. A pipeline is not required to raise its rates up to the index ceiling, but it is permitted to do so and rate increases made under the index ceiling are presumed to be just and reasonable unless a protesting party can demonstrate that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs. Under the indexing rate methodology, in any year in which the index is negative, pipelines must file to lower their rates if those rates would otherwise be above the rate ceiling. While common carriers often use the indexing methodology to change their rates, common carriers may elect to support proposed rates by using other methodologies such as cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates, and settlement rates. A pipeline can follow a cost-of-service approach when seeking to increase its rates above the rate ceiling (or when seeking to avoid lowering rates to the reduced rate ceiling). A common carrier can charge market-based rates if it establishes that it lacks significant market power in the affected markets. In addition, a common carrier can establish rates under settlement if agreed upon by all current shippers. We have used settlement rates for our dedicated crude oil pipelines. If we used cost-of-service rate making to establish or support our rates, the issue of the proper allowance for federal and state income taxes could arise.
In July 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit decided in United Airlines, Inc., et al. v. FERC, finding that FERC had acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it did not demonstrate 
that permitting an interstate petroleum products pipeline organized as a master limited partnership, or MLP, to include an income tax allowance in the cost of service underlying its rates, in addition to the discounted cash flow return on equity, would not result in the pipeline partnership owners double-recovering their income taxes. The court vacated FERC’s order and remanded to FERC for reconsideration. On March 15, 2018, FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes in which FERC found that permitting an MLP to recover from such an arrangement would constitute an impermissible double recovery. Accordingly, FERC, stated that it would no longer permit an MLP pipeline to recover an income tax allowance in its cost of service. FERC stated it will address the application of the United Airlines decision to non-MLP partnership forms as those issues arise in subsequent proceedings. Further, FERC stated that it will incorporate the effects of the post-United Airlines policy changes and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on industry-wide crude oil pipeline costs in the 2020 five-year review of the crude oil pipeline index level. FERC will also apply the revised Policy Statement and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to initial crude oil pipeline cost-of-service rates and cost-of-service rate changes on a going-forward basis under FERC’s existing ratemaking policies, including cost-of-service rate proceedings resulting from shipper-initiated complaints. On July 18, 2018, FERC dismissed requests for rehearing and clarification of the March 15, 2018 Revised Policy Statement, but provided further guidance, clarifying that a pass-through entity will not be precluded in a future proceeding from arguing and providing evidentiary support that it is entitled to an income tax allowance and demonstrating that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a double recovery of investors’ income tax costs. In connection with an appeal regarding the order, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld FERC’s position.
Intrastate services provided by our pipeline are subject to regulation by the Wyoming Public Service Commission. This state commission uses a complaint-based system of regulation, both as to matters involving rates and priority of access. The Wyoming Public Service Commission could limit our ability to increase our rates or to set rates based on our costs or order us to reduce our rates and require the payment of refunds to shippers. FERC and state regulatory commissions generally have not investigated rates, unless the rates are the subject of a protest or a complaint. However, FERC, or a state commission, could investigate our rates on its own initiative or at the urging of a third party. 
If our rate levels were investigated by FERC or a state commission, the inquiry could result in a comparison of our rates to those charged by others or to an investigation of our costs, including:
•the overall cost of service, including operating costs and overhead;
•the allocation of overhead and other administrative and general expenses to the regulated entity;
•the appropriate capital structure to be utilized in calculating rates;
•the appropriate rate of return on equity and interest rates on debt;
•the rate base, including the proper starting rate base;
•the throughput underlying the rate; and
•the proper allowance for federal and state income taxes
If the FERC, or the Wyoming Public Service Commission, on their own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower our tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types, or terms and conditions, of service we might propose, the profitability of our pipeline and terminals located in Casper, Wyoming and Stroud, Oklahoma, may suffer.
Security
While we are not currently subject to governmental standards for the protection of computer-based systems and technology from cyber threats and attacks, proposals to establish such standards are being considered in the U.S. Congress and by U.S. Executive Branch departments and agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, and we may become subject to such standards in the future. We have implemented our own cyber security programs and protocols; however, we cannot guarantee their effectiveness. A significant cyber-attack could have a material effect on our operations and those of our customers. 
Employee Safety 
We are subject to the requirements of the U.S. federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state and Canadian federal and provincial statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard and the Canadian Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System, or WHMIS, require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA in the United States and comparable state and Canadian federal and provincial requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES 
We are managed and operated by the board of directors and executive officers of USD Partners GP LLC, our general partner. Neither we nor our subsidiaries have any employees. Our general partner has the sole responsibility for providing the employees and other personnel necessary to conduct our operations. All of the employees that conduct our business are employed by affiliates of our general partner. Our general partner and its affiliates have approximately 85 employees, approximately 55 of whom performed services for our operations during 2022. We believe that our general partner and its affiliates have a satisfactory relationship with those employees.
Our general partner and its affiliates believe employees are among their most important resources and are critical to the continued success of their and our businesses. Our general partner and its affiliates are focused on attracting and retaining high quality talent by providing fair and market-competitive pay, which includes base pay as well as both short and long-term incentives. Our general partner and its affiliates also offer employees a competitive benefits package, which includes among others, health insurance, paid time off, and a 401(k) savings plan with employee contribution matching. Our general partner and its affiliates manage current and future leadership needs by employing a succession planning process that is reviewed annually by the Board, or its delegates. A review of progress in attracting and developing diverse candidates at all levels is part of that process. During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the voluntary attrition rate for employees that are employed by our general partner and its affiliates was approximately 5% and 6%, respectively. 
In addition, our general partner has a long-standing relationship with Railserve, Inc., or Railserve, a Marmon/Berkshire Hathaway company, to provide operating services for our terminals. Railserve is responsible for providing operations services to the terminals according to the specific contracts. Railserve is one of the largest in-plant rail operating services company in North America. Railserve operates over 80 switching and/or transloading locations across Canada, the United States and Mexico in the agriculture/food processing, chemical/plastics, energy/refining, intermodal, manufacturing, and pulp and paper markets. Railserve has over 1,400 personnel and 180+ Railserve owned and maintained locomotives. Railserve is responsible for attracting, retaining, supervising, and compensating its employees who are located at our terminals. To date, Railserve has successfully met our requirements for staffing operations at our terminals. 
INSURANCE
Our rail terminals, pipelines, storage tanks and railcars may experience damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. We maintain insurance and are insured under the property, business interruption and liability policies of USD and certain of its subsidiaries, subject to the deductibles and limits under those policies, which we consider to be reasonable and prudent under the circumstances to cover our operations and assets. However, such insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our assets, and we cannot ensure that such insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage, or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices. Although we believe that our assets are adequately covered by insurance, a substantial uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. As we grow, we will continue to monitor our policy limits and retentions as they relate to the overall cost and scope of our insurance program.
