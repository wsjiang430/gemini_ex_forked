Overview
We are the world’s largest supplier by production capacity of utility-grade wood pellets to major power generators. Since our entry into this business in 2010, we have executed multiple long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts with utilities and large-scale power generators and have built and acquired the production and terminaling capacity necessary to serve them. Our existing production constitutes approximately 13% of current global utility-grade wood pellet production capacity and the product we deliver to our customers typically comprises a material portion of their fuel supply. We own and operate six industrial-scale production plants in the Southeastern United States that have a combined wood pellet production capacity of 2.9 million metric tons per year (“MTPY”). In addition to the volumes from our plants, we also procure approximately 0.5 million MPTY from the Second Hancock JV’s Greenwood plant. We export wood pellets from our wholly owned dry-bulk, deep-water marine terminal in Chesapeake, Virginia (the “Chesapeake terminal”) and terminal assets in Wilmington, North Carolina (the “Wilmington terminal”), and from third-party deep-water marine terminals in Mobile, Alabama (the “Mobile terminal”) and Panama City, Florida (the “Panama City terminal”), under a short-term and a long-term contract, respectively. All of our facilities are located in geographic regions with low input costs and favorable transportation logistics. Owning these cost-advantaged assets, the output from which is fully contracted, in a rapidly expanding industry provides us with a platform to generate stable and growing cash flows that we anticipate will enable us to increase our per‑unit cash distributions over time, which is our primary business objective.
Our strategy is to fully contract the wood pellet production from our plants under long-term, take-or-pay, off-take contracts. During 2019, production from our plants and wood pellets sourced from the Greenwood plant and third parties are approximately equal to the contracted volumes under our existing long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts. Our long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts provide for sales of 3.4 million metric tons (“MT”) of wood pellets in 2019 and have a total weighted-average remaining term of 9.7 years from February 1, 2019. We intend to continue expanding our business by taking advantage of the growing demand for our product that is driven by conversion of coal-fired power generation and combined heat and power plants to co-fired or dedicated biomass-fired plants and construction of newly dedicated biomass-fired plants, principally in Europe and increasingly in Japan. 
We procure wood fiber and process it into utility-grade wood pellets at our production plants. We load the finished wood pellets into railcars, trucks and barges that are transported to our owned or leased deep-water marine terminal assets, where they are received, stored and ultimately loaded into oceangoing vessels for transport to our principally European customers.
Our customers use our wood pellets as a substitute fuel for coal in dedicated biomass or co-fired coal power plants. Wood pellets serve as a suitable “drop-in” alternative to coal because of their comparable heat content, density and form. Due to the uninterruptible nature of our customers’ fuel consumption, our customers require a reliable supply of wood pellets that meet stringent product specifications. We have built our operations and assets to deliver and certify the highest levels of product quality, and our proven track record enables us to charge premium prices for this certainty. In addition to our customers’ focus on the reliability of supply, they are concerned about the combustion efficiency of the wood pellets and their safe handling. Because combustion efficiency is a function of energy density, particle size distribution, ash/inert content and moisture, our customers require that we supply wood pellets meeting minimum criteria for a variety of specifications and, in some cases, provide incentives for exceeding our contract specifications.
Industry Overview
Our product, utility-grade wood pellets, is used as a substitute for coal in both dedicated and co-fired power generation and combined heat and power plants. It enables major power generators to profitably generate electricity in a manner that reduces the overall cost of compliance with certain mandatory greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions limits and renewable energy targets while also allowing countries to diversify their sources of electricity supply.
3

Unlike intermittent sources of renewable generation like wind and solar power, wood pellet-fired plants are capable of meeting baseload electricity demand and are dispatchable (that is, power output can be switched on or off or adjusted based on demand). As a result, utilities and major power generators in Europe and Asia have made and continue to make long-term, profitable investments in power plant conversions and new builds of generating assets that either co-fire wood pellets with coal or are fully dedicated wood pellet-fired plants. Such developments help generators in European and Asian markets maintain and increase baseload generating capacity, comply with binding climate change regulations and other emissions reduction targets and increase renewable energy usage at a lower cost to consumers and taxpayers than other forms of renewable energy generation.
The capital costs required to convert a coal plant to co-fire biomass, or to burn biomass exclusively, are a fraction of the capital costs associated with implementing offshore wind and most other renewable technologies. Furthermore, the relatively quick process of converting coal-fired plants to biomass-fired generation is an attractive benefit for power generators whose generation assets are no longer viable as coal plants due to the expiration of operating permits or the introduction of taxes or other restrictions on fossil fuel usage or emissions of GHGs and other pollutants.
There also continues to be significant growth in the European and Asian demand for wood pellets as the preferred fuel source and lower-cost alternative to delivered fossil fuels for district heating loops, for heating homes and commercial buildings and for the production of process heat at industrial sites. Increasingly, wood pellets are also being sought as a raw material input for bio-based substitutes for traditional fossil fuel‑based fuels and chemicals. As these markets further develop, there will continue to be opportunities for utility-grade wood pellet producers to serve this growing demand.
Assets and Operations
Our Production Plants
We own and operate six industrial-scale wood pellet production plants located in the Mid-Atlantic and the Gulf Coast regions of the United States, geographic areas in which wood fiber resources are plentiful and readily available. These facilities are designed to operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, although we schedule up to 15 days of maintenance for our plants during each calendar year. There are no regularly required major turnarounds or overhauls.
Mid-Atlantic Region Plants
The following table describes our four wood pellet production plants in the Mid-Atlantic region:
Plant Location | OperationsCommenced | Production(MTPY)
Ahoskie, North Carolina | 2011 | 415,000 
Northampton, North Carolina | 2013 | 550,000 
Sampson, North Carolina | 2016 | 555,000 
Southampton, Virginia | 2013 | 545,000 
Total | | 2,065,000 

Ahoskie
We acquired the site of the Ahoskie plant in December 2010 and constructed a dedicated wood pellet production plant in Ahoskie, North Carolina (the “Ahoskie plant”) in less than one year, commencing operations in November 2011. Through an expansion completed in June 2012, we increased the plant’s production from 260,000 MTPY to 350,000 MTPY and have made further improvements to increase production to 415,000 MTPY of wood pellets.
Production from the Ahoskie plant is transported by truck to our Chesapeake terminal.
Northampton
Our wood pellet production plant in Northampton, North Carolina (the “Northampton plant”) was constructed based on the Ahoskie plant design, utilizing the same major equipment suppliers. The Northampton plant currently produces 550,000 MTPY of wood pellets. During 2019, we expect to increase the wood pellet production of the Northampton plant to 750,000 MTPY, subject to receiving the necessary permits. We expect to complete expansion activities in early 2020 with startup shortly thereafter.
Production from the Northampton plant is transported by truck to our Chesapeake terminal.
4

Sampson
The Sampson plant, which was built based on our templated design and which we acquired from the First Hancock JV in December 2016, commenced operations during the fourth quarter of 2016 and currently produces 555,000 MTPY of wood pellets.
Production from the Sampson plant is transported by truck to our Wilmington terminal.
Southampton
We acquired a wood pellet production plant in Southampton County, Virginia (the “Southampton plant”) from the First Hancock JV in December 2015. The Southampton plant is a build-and-copy replica of our Northampton plant and currently produces 545,000 MTPY of wood pellets. During 2019, we expect to increase the production capacity of the Southampton plant to 745,000 MTPY of wood pellets, subject to receiving the necessary permits. We expect to complete expansion activities in early 2020 with startup shortly thereafter.
Production from the Southampton plant is transported by truck to our Chesapeake terminal.
Gulf Coast Region Plants
The following table describes our two wood pellet production plants in the Gulf Coast region:
Plant Location | Acquisition Year | Production(MTPY)
Cottondale, Florida | 2015 | 730,000 
Amory, Mississippi | 2010 | 120,000 
Total | | 850,000 

Cottondale
Our sponsor acquired a wood pellet production plant in Cottondale, Florida (the “Cottondale plant”), in January 2015 and contributed it to us in April 2015. Following the acquisition of the Cottondale plant from our sponsor, the Cottondale plant has undergone several expansions and process improvements. Expansion projects during 2016 and 2017 increased its production capacity from 720,000 MTPY to 730,000 MTPY of wood pellets.
Wood pellets produced by the Cottondale plant are transported approximately 50 miles by short-line rail to a warehouse that can store up to 32,000 MT of wood pellet inventory at the Panama City terminal.
Amory
We purchased a wood pellet production plant in Amory, Mississippi (the “Amory plant”) in August 2010. The Amory plant initially consisted of three pellet mills producing wood pellets at a rate of 41,500 MTPY. Through operational improvements and installation of a fourth pellet mill, the Amory plant currently produces 120,000 MTPY of wood pellets.
Production from the Amory plant is transported by barge to the Mobile terminal.
Logistics and Storage Capabilities
To-Port Logistics and Port Infrastructure
We site our production plants to minimize wood fiber procurement and logistics costs. Our production plants are strategically located in advantaged fiber baskets and near multiple truck, rail, river and ocean transportation access points. We also have inland waterway access and rail access at the Chesapeake, Wilmington, and Panama City terminals. Our multi-year fixed-cost contracts with third-party logistics providers allow for long-term visibility into our to-port logistics cost structure.
The wood pellets produced at our plants must be stored, terminaled and shipped to our principally European customers. Limited deep-water, dry-bulk terminaling assets exist in the Southeastern United States, and very few of them have the appropriate handling and storage infrastructure necessary for receiving, storing and loading wood pellets. In response to such scarcity, we have vertically integrated our Mid-Atlantic operations downstream to encompass finished product logistics and storage. As a largely fixed cost and capital intensive piece of the value chain, our port infrastructure allows us to ship incremental product from our regional plants at a small fraction of the cost of our competitors. Management of port terminal infrastructure is also a key element in reducing distribution-related costs as it allows us to manage the arrival and loading of vessels. Additionally, we are able to improve our cost position by maintaining a dedicated berth where pellets from our Mid-Atlantic region plants have priority and equipment with sufficient load-rate capabilities to turn around vessels within the allotted time windows.
5

In addition to terminaling wood pellets from our production plants, we will, on occasion, provide terminaling services for third‑ and related-party wood pellet producers as well as for owners of other dry-bulk commodities. 
Port Operation in the Mid-Atlantic Region
We acquired the Chesapeake terminal in January 2011 and converted it into a major dry-bulk terminal. The Chesapeake terminal receives, stores and loads wood pellets for export and serves as the shipment point for products produced at our Ahoskie, Northampton and Southampton plants. The Chesapeake terminal accommodates Handysize, Supramax and Panamax-sized vessels, and has a 200-car rail yard adjacent to a Norfolk Southern track, a loading/unloading system that accommodates deliveries by truck, rail and barge and a highly automated conveying system. In May 2011, we erected a 157-foot tall, 175-foot wide storage dome that receives, stores and loads up to 45,000 MT of wood pellets. In April 2013, we placed into operation a second storage dome at the site to add an additional 45,000 MT of storage. 
The Chesapeake terminal’s storage and loading capacity is more than adequate to store and facilitate the loading of the wood pellets produced from our Northampton, Southampton and Ahoskie plants, and its location decreases our customers’ transportation time and costs. Efficiently positioned near our Northampton, Southampton and Ahoskie plants, the Chesapeake terminal delivers up to a three- to four-day European shipping advantage compared to other Southern or Gulf Coast ports. In addition, because we own the Chesapeake terminal, we enjoy preferential berth access and loading, which minimizes costs of shipping and logistics without the need for excess storage. Our ownership and operation of this terminal enable us to control shipment of the production of our Mid-Atlantic region plants that it serves.
Wood pellets produced at our Sampson plant and at a wood pellet production plant in Greenwood, South Carolina (the “Greenwood plant”), owned by the Second Hancock JV, are terminaled at our Wilmington terminal. The Wilmington terminal accommodates Handysize, Supramax and Panamax-sized vessels, and has a receiving system that accommodates deliveries by truck and rail, a highly automated conveying system and two wood pellet storage domes with capacities of 45,000 MT each. The Wilmington terminal’s storage and loading capacity is more than adequate to store and facilitate the loading of pellets produced from our Sampson plant and the Greenwood plant and its location decreases transportation time and costs through the entire supply chain. We benefit from preferential berth access and loading at our Wilmington terminal, which minimizes costs of shipping and logistics without need for excess storage.
Port Operation in the Gulf Coast Region
Wood pellets from our Cottondale plant are transported via short‑line rail to the Panama City terminal, where we store up to 32,000 MT of wood pellet inventory in a warehouse at Port Panama City. Production from the Cottondale plant is received, stored and loaded under a long‑term terminal services agreement with the Panama City Port Authority and a stevedoring contract, each of which runs through September 2023 and may be extended by us for an additional five-year period.
Wood pellets produced at our Amory plant are transported by barge to the Mobile terminal, where, pursuant to a services agreement with Cooper Marine & Timberlands (“Cooper”), we export from Cooper’s ChipCo terminal. This privately owned and maintained deep-water, multi-berth terminal operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week and is the fleeting and loading point for production from our Amory plant. The Amory plant is sited along a major inland waterway that makes transportation to the Mobile terminal easy and efficient, thereby reducing emissions and costs. Our ability to store our wood pellets in barges provides a capital-light, flexible solution that accommodates the storage needs of the Amory plant.
Please read Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Development” and ” Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Significant Accounting Policies—Segment and Geographic Information” for more information regarding our plants, terminals and other long‑lived assets.
Our Relationship with Our Sponsor
Our sponsor, Enviva Holdings, LP, is a majority owned subsidiary of the Riverstone Funds.
Our sponsor owns approximately 45% of our common units and all of our General Partner. Our General Partner owns our incentive distribution rights, which entitles our General Partner to increasing percentages of our cash distributions above certain targets. As a result, our sponsor is incentivized to facilitate our access to accretive acquisitions and organic growth opportunities, including those pursuant to a right of first offer under the Purchase Rights Agreement.
In November 2014, Enviva Development Holdings, LLC (“Development Holdings”) entered into a joint venture (the “First Hancock JV”) with John Hancock Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.) and certain of its affiliates to acquire, develop and construct wood pellet production plants and deep-water marine terminals such as the Southampton, Sampson and Hamlet plants and the Wilmington terminal. In December 2017, Development Holdings entered into a second joint venture with John Hancock Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.) and certain of its affiliates (the “Second Hancock JV”) to acquire, develop and construct wood pellet production plants and deep-water marine terminals in the Southeastern United States. Development Holdings is the managing

member and Enviva Management is the operator of the First Hancock JV and the Second Hancock JV (together, the “Hancock JVs”) and is responsible for managing the activities of the Hancock JVs, including the development and construction of the development projects of the Hancock JVs.
In 2015, we entered into a purchase rights agreement (the “Purchase Rights Agreement”) with our sponsor, pursuant to which our sponsor granted us a five-year right of first offer to acquire any wood pellet production plants and associated deep-water marine terminals that it or the Hancock JVs may develop or acquire and elect to sell. We expect to continue to pursue the acquisition of such assets from our sponsor and the Hancock JVs to the extent they are supported by long-term off-take contracts with creditworthy counterparties and have long useful lives, stable cost positions and advantaged locations.
Although we expect to continue to have the opportunity to acquire assets, including those described below, from our sponsor and the Hancock JVs, there can be no assurance that our sponsor or the Hancock JVs will complete their development projects or that our sponsor will decide to sell, or compel the Hancock JVs to sell, assets or completed development projects to us. The right of first offer under the Purchase Rights Agreement expires in May 2020.
Our Sponsor’s Assets and Development Projects
Hamlet Plant
The First Hancock JV has secured permits and is nearing completion of construction of a wood pellet production plant in Hamlet, North Carolina (the “Hamlet plant”), which is strategically sited in an attractive wood fiber basket and has been constructed using our “build-and-copy” approach, using substantially the same design and equipment as the Sampson plant. Following a ramp period, the Hamlet plant is expected to reach wood pellet production of 600,000 MTPY. Production from the Hamlet plant, once completed, will be terminaled at the Wilmington terminal. The First Hancock JV expects that the Hamlet plant will be operational in the first half of 2019.
Greenwood Plant
The Second Hancock JV acquired the Greenwood plant as its first investment. The Second Hancock JV intends to make investments in the Greenwood plant to improve its operational efficiency and increase its production capacity to 600,000 MTPY of wood pellets, subject to receiving the necessary permits. 
In February 2018, we entered into a contract with Greenwood to purchase wood pellets produced by the Greenwood plant through March 2022 and have a take-or-pay obligation with respect to 550,000 MTPY of wood pellets (prorated for partial contract years) beginning in mid-2019 and subject to Greenwood’s option to increase or decrease the volume by 10% each contract year. Wood pellets produced at the Greenwood plant are exported from our Wilmington terminal.
Other Sponsor Development Projects
In addition to the projects discussed above, the Second Hancock JV is pursuing the development of additional deep-water marine terminals and production plants. The Second Hancock JV has executed agreements with the Jackson County Port Authority granting the Second Hancock JV an option to build and operate a marine export terminal at the Port of Pascagoula, Mississippi (the “Pascagoula terminal”), which would service new, regionally proximate production plants, including a potential wood pellet production plant in Lucedale, Mississippi (the “Lucedale plant”). 
Customers
We have long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts with utilities and large European power generators such as Drax Power Limited (“Drax”), Ørsted Bioenergy & Thermal Power A/S (“Ørsted,” formerly known as “DONG Energy Thermal Power A/S”), Lynemouth Power Limited (“Lynemouth Power”), Engie Energy Management SCRL (“ENGIE”), and MGT Teesside Limited (“MGT”) (through two contracts with the First Hancock JV). We have also executed long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts with customers in Japan including Mitsubishi Corporation (“Mitsubishi”), Marubeni Corporation (“Marubeni”). Additionally, we have executed a long-term take-or-pay off-take contract with a major Japanese trading house to supply a Japanese independent power producer, subject to certain conditions precedent, which we expect to be met in the first quarter of 2019.

We also have entered into several other contracts that have smaller off-take quantities than the contracts described above. We diversified our customer base during 2018; however, our four largest customers accounted for 90% of our product sales in 2018.
We refer to the structure of our long-term contracts as “take-or-pay” because they include a firm obligation of the customer to take a fixed quantity of product at a stated price and provisions for us to be compensated in the event of a customer’s failure to accept all or a part of the contracted volumes or for termination of a contract by a customer. Our long-term contracts typically provide for annual inflation‑based adjustments or price escalators. Certain of our long-term contracts also contain provisions that allow us to increase or decrease the volume of product that we deliver by a percentage of the base volume of the contract, as well as cost pass-through mechanisms related to stumpage, fuel or transportation costs and price adjustments for actual product specifications. In addition, certain of our long-term contracts and related arrangements provide for certain cost recovery and sharing arrangements in connection with certain changes in law or sustainability requirements as well as payments to us in the case of their termination as a result of such changes.
In addition to our long-term contracts, we also fulfill our contractual commitments and take advantage of dislocations in market supply and demand by entering into purchase and sale transactions. We typically are the principal in such transactions because we control the wood pellets prior to transferring them to the customer and therefore recognize related revenue on a gross basis.
In some instances, a customer may request to cancel, defer, or accelerate a shipment, in which case we seek to optimize our position by selling or purchasing the subject shipment to or from another party, including in some cases a related party, either within our contracted off‑take portfolio or as an independent transaction on the spot market. In most instances, the original customer pays us a fee, including reimbursement of any incremental costs, which is included in other revenue.
We also provide terminaling services for third- and related-party wood pellet producers as well as for owners of other bulk commodities.
Contracted Backlog
As of February 1, 2019, we had approximately $7.9 billion of product sales backlog for firm and contingent contracted product sales to major power generators and have a total weighted-average remaining term of 9.7 years from February 1, 2019 compared to approximately $5.8 billion and a total weighted-average remaining term of 9.5 years as of February 15, 2018. Backlog represents the revenue to be recognized under existing contracts assuming deliveries occur as specified in the contract. Contracted future product sales denominated in foreign currencies, excluding revenue hedged with foreign currency forward contracts, are included in U.S. Dollars at February 1, 2019 forward rates. The contracted backlog includes forward prices including inflation, foreign currency and commodity prices. The amount also includes the effects of related foreign currency derivative contracts. Please read Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Derivative Instruments” for more information regarding our foreign currency forward contracts.
Our expected future product sales revenue under our contracted backlog as of February 1, 2019 is as follows (in millions):

Period from February 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 | $ | 609 
Year ending December 31, 2020 | 779 | 
Year ending December 31, 2021 and thereafter | 6,525 | 
Total product sales contracted backlog | $ | 7,913

Assuming all volumes under the firm and contingent off-take contracts held by our sponsor and its joint ventures were included with our product sales backlog for firm and contingent contracted product sales, the total weighted-average remaining term as of February 1, 2019 would increase to 12.3 years and product sales backlog would increase to $14.6 billion as follows (in millions):

Period from February 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 | $ | 609 
Year ending December 31, 2020 | 879 | 
Year ending December 31, 2021 and thereafter | 13,066 | 
Total product sales contracted backlog | $ | 14,554

Included in the product sales backlog above are $0.6 billion and $2.2 billion of contingent contracts held by the Partnership and the sponsor and its joint ventures, respectively.

Wood Fiber Procurement
Although stumpage constitutes a small portion of our total cost of delivered products, wood fiber procurement is a vital function of our business, and cost-effective access to wood fiber is an important factor in our pricing stability. Our raw materials are byproducts of traditional timber harvesting, principally low-value wood materials such as trees generally not suited for sawmilling or other manufactured forest products and the tops and limbs of trees that are generated in a harvest. We procure wood fiber directly from timber owners, loggers and other suppliers. We also opportunistically acquire industrial residuals (sawdust and shavings) when they provide a cost or operating advantage. Due to the moisture content of unprocessed wood, it cannot be transported economically over long distances. Therefore, the specific regional wood fiber resource supply and demand balance dictates the underlying economics of wood fiber procurement. For this reason, we have elected to site our facilities in some of the most robust and advantaged fiber baskets in the world.
Our customers are subject to stringent requirements regarding the sustainability of the fuels they procure. In addition to our internal sustainability policies and initiatives, our wood fiber procurement is conducted in accordance with leading forest certification standards. Our fiber supply chains are routinely audited by independent third parties. We maintain multiple forest certifications including: Forest Stewardship Council (FSC®) Chain of Custody, FSC® Controlled Wood, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC™) Chain of Custody, Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI®) Fiber Sourcing and SFI® Chain of Custody. We have obtained independent third-party certification for all of our plants to the applicable Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP) Standards.
Our wood fiber demand is complementary to, rather than in competition with, demand for high‑grade wood for use by most other forest-related industries, such as lumber and furniture making. For example, improvements in the U.S. housing construction industry increase the demand for construction‑quality lumber, which in turn increases the available supply of the low-cost pulpwood and mill residues that are used in wood pellet production. By using commercial thinnings and byproducts as raw materials, wood pellet production also indirectly supports other forest-related industries as well as the sustainable management of commercial forests.
The wood fiber used for wood pellet production comprises predominantly pulpwood, which derives its name from its traditional use by the pulp and paper industry and includes roundwood (typically low-grade trees, thinnings from forest management operations and the tops and branches from sawlogs), and wood residues (primarily mill residues, a byproduct of sawmilling and veneer mill operations). Our procured wood fiber consists of:

• | low-grade wood fiber: trees or wood that are unsuitable for or rejected by the sawmilling and lumber industries because of small size, defects (e.g. crooked or knotty), disease or pest infestation;


• | tops and limbs: the parts of trees that cannot be processed into lumber;


• | commercial thinnings: harvests that promote the growth of higher value timber by removing weaker or deformed trees to reduce competition for water, nutrients and sunlight; and


• | mill residues: chips, sawdust and other wood industry byproducts.

Demand for the non-merchantable trees, waste products or byproducts that we use is generally low because they have few competing uses. The tops, limbs and other low-grade wood fiber we purchase would otherwise generally be left on the forest floor, impeding reforestation, or burned. Wood pellet production provides a profitable use for the residues from sawmill and furniture industries and also for the trees that are thinned to support the growth of higher value lumber-grade trees. U.S. demand for such low-grade wood fiber historically emerged from the pulp and paper industry. However, due to the decline in demand from paper and pulp, many landowners lack commercial markets for this wood fiber. Wood pellet producers help fill the gap.
As a result of the fragmented nature of tract ownership, we procure raw materials from hundreds of landowners, loggers and timber industry participants, with no individual landowner representing a material fraction of any of our production plants’ needs. Our wood fiber is procured under a variety of arrangements, including (1) logging contracts for the thinnings, pulpwood and other unmerchandised chip-and-saw timber cut by a harvester, (2) in-woods chipping contracts where we may also provide the harvesting assets and (3) contracts with timber dealers. Via our sponsor’s proprietary Track & Trace® system, we maintain 100% traceability of the primary wood that is delivered to us directly from forests. Any supplier delivering wood to one of our plants must first share the details about the forest characteristics of the tract from which the wood is sourced with our forestry staff so we can verify that it meets our strict sustainability criteria. Our supplier contracts require a certification that the relevant tract information has been entered into our database before wood may be delivered directly from a particular tract. We summarize all such tract information periodically and publish tract-level details on our website. During 2018, we sourced wood fiber from approximately 300 suppliers, including brokers who source from landowners growing both hardwoods and softwoods and other suppliers. The diversity of our supply base and our facilities’ advantaged siting enables us to benefit from more reliable deliveries, at a lower cost, than others in our region or industry.

Competition
We compete with other utility-grade wood pellet producers for long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts with major power generation customers and related trading houses. Competition in our industry is based on the price, quality and consistency of the wood pellets produced, the reliability of wood pellet deliveries and the producer’s ability to verify and document, through customer and third-party audits, that its wood pellets meet the regulatory sustainability obligations of a particular customer.
Most of the world’s current wood pellet production plants are owned by small, private companies, with few companies owning or operating multiple plants. Few companies have the scale, technical expertise or commercial infrastructure necessary to supply utility-grade wood pellets under large, long-term off-take contracts with power generators.
We are the largest producer by production capacity, and consider other companies with comparable scale, technical expertise or commercial infrastructure to be our competitors, including AS Graanul Invest, Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc., Drax Biomass Inc., Georgia Biomass, LLC, Fram Renewable Fuels, LLC, Highland Pellets LLC, and Pacific BioEnergy Corporation.
Employees
We are party to a management services agreement with Enviva Management, pursuant to which Enviva Management provides us with the employees, management and services necessary for the operation of our business. As of December 31, 2018, Enviva Management had 856 employees. Please read Part II, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence—Other Transactions with Related Persons--Management Services Agreement” for more information regarding our MSA with Enviva Management.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing matters including protection of the environment and natural resources, occupational health and safety and the release or discharge of materials into the environment, including air emissions and wastewater discharges. These laws and regulations may (1) require acquisition, compliance with and maintenance of certain permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities, (2) impose technology requirements or standards on our operations, (3) restrict the amounts and types of substances that may be discharged or emitted into the environment, (4) limit or prohibit construction or timbering activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species, (5) govern worker health and safety aspects of operations, (6) require measures to investigate, mitigate or remediate releases of hazardous or other substances from our operations and (7) impose substantial liabilities, including possible fines and penalties for unpermitted emissions or discharges from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas.
Moreover, the global trend in environmental regulation is towards increasingly broad and stringent requirements for activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re‑interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Although we monitor environmental requirements closely and budget for the expected costs, actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate spending. Moreover, certain environmental laws impose strict joint and several liability for costs to clean up and restore sites where pollutants have been disposed or otherwise spilled or released. We cannot assure that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities for remediation or damage to property, natural resources or persons as a result of spills or releases from our operations or those of a third party. Although we believe that our competitors face similar environmental requirements, other market factors may prevent us from passing on any increased costs to our customers. Additionally, although we believe that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially adversely affect us, there is no assurance that the current levels of regulation will continue in the future.
The following summarizes some of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our operations, the failure to comply with which could have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations and financial position.
11

Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act, as amended (the “CAA”), and state and local laws and regulations that implement and add to CAA requirements, regulate the emission of air pollutants from our facilities. The CAA and state and local laws and regulations impose significant monitoring, testing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements for these emissions. These laws and regulations require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit emission limits, and in certain cases utilize specific equipment or technologies to control and measure emissions. Obtaining these permits can be both costly and time intensive and has potential to delay opening of new plants or significant expansion of existing plants. Complying with these permits, including satisfying testing requirements, can also be costly and time-intensive and has the potential to have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permit requirements may cause us to face fines, penalties or injunctive orders in connection with air pollutant emissions from our operations.
The CAA requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits, including, in some cases, Title V air permits. In certain cases, the CAA requires us to incur capital expenditures to install air pollution control devices at our facilities. We are also required to control fugitive emissions from our operations and may face fines, penalties or injunctive orders in connection with fugitive emissions from our operations. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial administrative, operating and capital expenditures to maintain compliance with CAA requirements that have been promulgated or may be promulgated or revised in the future. 
Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases
In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that require GHG emissions reductions from motor vehicles and certain stationary sources. At this time, the EPA requires biomass facilities with GHG emissions above 75,000 tons per year that are otherwise subject to CAA permitting to undergo CAA pre-construction review and obtain operating permits for their GHG emissions. Any other legislation or regulations that require permitting or reporting of GHG emissions or limit such emissions from our equipment and operations or from biomass-fired power plants operated by our customers could require us to incur costs to reduce such emissions or negatively impact demand for wood pellets. Furthermore, although in April 2018 the EPA categorized biomass as a carbon-neutral fuel, several environmental groups have criticized this determination and are attempting to have it changed. Finally, scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, including forest fires. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations.
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (the “Clean Water Act”), as well as state laws and regulations that implement, and may be more stringent than, the Clean Water Act, restrict the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. Any such discharge of pollutants must be performed in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the implementing state agency. In addition, the Clean Water Act and implementing state laws and regulations require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non‑compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. These permits generally have a term of five years. Certain of our facilities hold such discharge permits. Changes to the terms and conditions of our permits in future renewals or new or modified regulations could require us to incur additional capital or operating expenditures, which may be material.
Pursuant to the Clean Water Act, the EPA has adopted the Discharge of Oil regulation, which requires any person in charge of an onshore facility to report any discharge of a harmful quantity of oil into U.S. navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or the contiguous zone. A harmful quantity is any quantity of discharged oil that violates state water quality standards, causes a film or sheen on the water’s surface or leaves sludge or emulsion beneath the surface. Spills from our production plants that are located along waterways or from our deep-water marine terminal facilities may result in fines, penalties and obligations to respond to and remediate any such spills. We could also be liable for removal and remediation costs, as well as damages to natural resources, in the event of an unauthorized discharge of oil from one of our facilities.
Spill Response and Release Reporting
Certain of our facilities are subject to federal requirements to prepare for and respond to spills or releases from tanks and other equipment located at these facilities and provide training to employees on operation, maintenance and discharge prevention procedures and the applicable pollution control laws. At such facilities, we have developed or will develop Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure plans to memorialize our preparation and response plans and will update them on a regular basis. From time to time, these requirements may be made more stringent and may require us to modify our operations or expand our plans accordingly. 
12

The costs of implementing any such modifications or expansion may be significant. In addition, in the event of a spill or release, we may incur fines or penalties or incur responsibility for damage to natural resources, private property or personal injury in addition to obligations to respond to and remediate any such spill or release.
Endangered Species Act
The federal Endangered Species Act, as amended (the “ESA”), restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. Although some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, this has not so far had a material adverse impact on our business. Some of our suppliers may source materials from locations that provide habitats for species that are protected under the ESA, which may extend the time required to access those areas, or may impose conditions or restrictions on accessing those areas in a way that restricts our ability to obtain raw materials for our wood pellet production plants. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on September 9, 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make a determination regarding the listing of more than 250 species by the end of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. While the agency did not complete its review by the deadline, that process reportedly remains underway. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas, which could have an adverse impact on the availability or price of raw materials.
Coastal Area Protection and Wetlands and Navigable Waters Activity Regulations
Our terminals are located in areas that are subject to the various federal and state programs that regulate the conservation and development of coastal resources. At the federal level, the Coastal Zone Management Act (the “CZMA”) was enacted to preserve, protect, develop and, where possible, restore or enhance valuable natural coastal resources of the U.S. coastal zone. The CZMA authorizes and provides grants for state management programs to regulate land and water use and coastal development. Requirements under the CZMA may affect the siting of any new terminals and could impact the expansion of modification of existing terminal facilities. The CZMA process may result either in delays in obtaining the required authorizations to construct a new terminal or expand an existing terminal or conditions that may restrict the construction or operation of our terminals.
In addition to the CZMA, requirements under the Clean Water Act and related federal laws may result in federal or state regulators imposing conditions or restrictions on our operations or construction activities. For instance, the dredge and fill provisions of the Clean Water Act require a permit to conduct construction activities in protected waters and wetlands and prohibit unpermitted discharges of fill materials. Likewise, the Rivers and Harbors Act requires permits for the construction of certain port structures. Although compliance has not previously had a material adverse impact on our business, any delays in obtaining future permits or renewals, or the inclusion of restrictive conditions in such permits, could adversely affect the cost of, or result in delays to, our operations and the construction of new, or expansion of existing, terminals.
Safety and Maintenance
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. We have a corporate health and safety program that governs the way we conduct our operations at our facilities. Our employees receive OSHA training that is appropriate in light of the tasks performed at our facilities and general training on our health and safety plans. Compliance with OSHA and general training is mandatory. We perform preventive and routine maintenance on all of our manufacturing and deep-water marine terminaling systems, and make repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate. We also conduct routine and required inspections of those assets in accordance with applicable regulations. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standards in the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. Our facilities adhere to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards for combustible dust and incorporate pollution control equipment such as cyclones, baghouses and electrostatic precipitators to minimize regulated emissions. Our deep-water marine terminals adhere to Homeland Security/U.S. Coast Guard regulations regarding physical security and emergency response plans. We continually strive to maintain compliance with applicable air, solid waste and wastewater regulations; nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that serious accidents will not occur in the future.
Seasonality
Our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations. The cost of producing wood pellets tends to be higher in the winter months because of increases in the cost of delivered raw materials, primarily due to a reduction in accessibility during cold and wet weather conditions. Our raw materials typically have higher moisture content during this period, resulting in a lower product yield; moreover, the cost of drying wood fiber increases during periods of lower ambient temperatures. 
13

The increase in demand for power and heat during the winter months drives greater customer demand for wood pellets. As some of our wood pellet supply to our customers is sourced from third-party purchases, we may experience higher wood pellet costs and a reduction in our gross margin during the winter months.
