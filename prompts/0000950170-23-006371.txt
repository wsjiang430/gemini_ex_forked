 Overview
We are an online ticket marketplace that utilizes our technology platform to connect fans of live events seamlessly with ticket sellers. Our mission is to empower and enable fans to Experience It Live.
 We believe in the power of shared experiences to connect people with live events delivering some of life’s most exciting moments. We are relentless about finding ways to make event discovery and ticket purchasing easy, exciting and stress-free. Our platform provides ticket buyers and sellers with an easy-to-use, trusted marketplace experience, ensuring fans can attend live events and create new memories.
 We operate a technology platform and marketplace that enables ticket buyers to easily discover and purchase tickets from ticket sellers while enabling ticket sellers to seamlessly manage their operations. To generate ticket sales, drive traffic to our website and mobile applications, and build brand recognition, we have mutually beneficial partnerships with media partners, product and service partners, distribution partners and content rights holders such as teams, leagues and venues. To attract and retain sellers, we offer a variety of products and services that allow their businesses to thrive.
Our platform is built on years of transactional and engagement data that provides us with deep insights into how to best connect ticket buyers with the experiences they seek. We understand the feeling of anticipation as the start of an event approaches and work diligently to enable fans to experience as many of these moments as possible. We seek to provide enriching customer engagement opportunities with personalized recommendations, engaging discovery options, a streamlined shopping experience and a differentiated value proposition through competitively priced tickets and loyalty rewards. Our Vivid Seats Rewards program allows ticket buyers to earn Reward Credits to spend on future orders and experience even more of their favorite events.
In December 2021, we acquired Betcha Sports, Inc. (“Betcha”), a real money daily fantasy sports app with social and gamification features. In August 2022, we rebranded Betcha as Vivid Picks, LLC (“Vivid Picks”) and integrated the product into our ecosystem. We leverage the natural overlap between sports fans who play fantasy and sports fans who buy tickets. We also learn more about our customer preferences, and foster engagement between ticketing transactions. Within the Vivid Picks app, users are able to place entries and engage socially, as well as browse, discover, and buy tickets to events.
 As a two-sided marketplace, our customer base includes both ticket buyers and ticket sellers, as well as Vivid Picks daily fantasy sports users.
Our Business Model

We operate our business in two segments, Marketplace and Resale.
Marketplace
In our Marketplace segment, we act as an intermediary between ticket buyers and sellers through which we earn revenue from processing ticket sales on our website and mobile applications and sales initiated through our numerous distribution partners. Our Marketplace segment also includes our daily fantasy sports offering, where users partake in contests by making picks from a variety of sport and player matchups. Using our online platform, customers are able to make payments, deposits and withdrawals, and we coordinate ticket deliveries, and provide customer service to our ticket buyers and sellers and daily fantasy sports users. We do not hold ticket inventory in our Marketplace segment.
 We primarily earn revenue from service and delivery fees charged to ticket buyers. We also earn referral fee revenue by offering event ticket insurance to ticket buyers, using a third-party insurance provider. The revenue we earn from our daily fantasy sports offering is the difference between cash entry fees collected and cash amounts paid out to users for winning picks, less customer promotions and incentives in a period.
We incur costs for developing and maintaining our platform, providing back-office and customer support to ticket buyers, sellers and daily fantasy sports users, facilitating payments and shipping non-electronic tickets. We also incur substantial marketing costs, primarily related to online advertising.
A key component of our platform is Skybox, a proprietary enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) tool used by the majority of our ticket sellers. Skybox is a free-to-use system that helps ticket sellers manage ticket inventories, adjust pricing, and fulfill orders across multiple ticket resale marketplaces. Professional ticket sellers use an ERP to manage their operations and Skybox is their most widely adopted ERP.
The tickets we sell through our Marketplace segment are diversified across event categories including sports, concerts and theater. A diversified mix across these three major categories broadens our opportunities, limits exposure to any particular category, and reduces seasonal variation in order volumes.
Within each of these categories, there are a broad range of productions that provide further diversification:
 •Sports. The sports category includes the four major professional leagues (MLB, NFL, NBA and NHL), college sports and a wide variety of other sporting activities including soccer, racing and minor league baseball.
 •Concerts. The concert category includes musical acts across a broad range of genres touring across major venues, small venues, and music festivals.
 •Theater. The theater category includes Broadway and off-Broadway plays and musicals, family entertainment events, comedy acts, and speaker series.
 Resale
In our Resale segment, we acquire tickets to resell on secondary ticket marketplaces, including our own. Our Resale segment also provides internal research and development support for Skybox and our ongoing efforts to deliver industry-leading seller software and tools.
Our Growth Strategies
 New Customer Acquisition via Performance Marketing
 Fans interested in attending live events frequently utilize internet search engines to browse tickets. With our proprietary digital marketing technology and real-time first-party data, we have historically captured customer search traffic within reasonable customer acquisition cost thresholds. We will continue to hone our performance marketing algorithms, test new performance marketing channels and invest to acquire new customers where we identify positive lifetime value.
Increase Our Brand Awareness and Affinity
 We want Vivid Seats to be the go-to ticketing marketplace for buyers and sellers when searching for, purchasing and selling event tickets. We seek to offer the best value to ticket buyers and sellers in the secondary ticketing market and want to amplify our message to maximize awareness of what differentiates our offerings. We differentiate ourselves from competitors by offering an extensive breadth and depth of ticket listings at a competitive value. Our Vivid Seats Rewards program allows ticket buyers to earn Reward Credits to spend on future orders, enhancing our value proposition, and also surprises and delights buyers with other perks and upgrades. Our most recent brand campaign connects Vivid Seats with the number 11 and drives awareness of the key tenet of our Vivid Seats Rewards program, the free 11th ticket.
 We offer a reliable and secure experience for ticket buyers. We provide our buyers with award-winning customer service and a 100% buyer guarantee. Our 100% buyer guarantee provides full-service customer care, safe and secure transactions and valid tickets, which are delivered before the event. Our ticket buyers receive compensation for late delivery of tickets and cancelled events. Live event tickets are often a significant purchase. The more customers understand our value proposition, appreciate that we are a trusted marketplace, develop an affinity for our brand, and interact with our platform, the more transactions we expect to complete.
Increase Customer Retention
 Once customers transact with us, many return and complete additional transactions. We seek to increase both the number and frequency of these repeat customer visits and transactions by having ticket buyers view us as their ticketing platform of choice. The combination of our Vivid Seats Rewards program, increasing brand awareness and ongoing product improvements will drive a more personalized and engaging experience and will result in greater affinity towards our marketplace. As ticket buyers gain a full appreciation of our value proposition relative to other ticketing marketplaces, we anticipate they will increasingly choose us over other marketplaces and make purchases more frequently. We typically incur lower marketing costs from repeat customers that go directly to our website and mobile application to browse and place orders.
Increase Customer Engagement
 We want to connect with our customers and we want our customers to connect with us. Such engagement allows us to know our customers better, fosters brand affinity and ultimately drives higher repeat purchase activity. We aim to close the awareness gap to ensure that our ticket buyers know when their favorite artists or sports teams are performing or playing near them. Accordingly, we strive to improve the discovery process to help our ticket buyers attend more of their favorite events.
 We provide customized content to our customers to enhance their experience while driving continued engagement. We provide a broad selection of competitively priced tickets and personalized recommendations, blog content, and industry news. Additionally, with Vivid Picks we provide an adjacent opportunity for our sports fans to partake in a fun, interactive gamification experience where they can play and win real money.
Develop Additional Seller Tools and Services
 We enable our ticket sellers to thrive by offering products and services that support their business needs. Our proprietary Skybox platform helps ticket sellers manage their inventory, set pricing, fulfill orders, and track sales. We have a proud history of innovating to support our ticket sellers and continue to develop additional tools and service offerings that address existing problems or add efficiency to the sales and fulfillment process. As we increase the quality and depth of our seller tools and service offerings, we will attract additional sellers and listings to our platform, reinforce our existing seller relationships and help sellers improve the efficiency of their business processes. We anticipate this will result in more transactions in our marketplace.
Expand our Partnerships
 Partnerships are an important and additive part of our ecosystem. They help generate ticket sales, drive traffic to our website and mobile applications and build brand recognition. Our partner ecosystem includes:


•Media Partners. We have partnered with well-known media companies to integrate our branding, promotions and links to allow their users to access and purchase tickets from us. By working with media partners, we broaden our reach and cultivate brand awareness with high-value live event fans. We enhance their users' experiences by providing a wide variety of tickets at competitive prices. Our partnership with ESPN, for example, exposes our tickets sellers’ inventory to new audiences with high interest in attending a variety of live sporting events. 
 •Product and Service Partners. We partner with providers of related products and services when they are additive to our customers' experiences. For example, we offer ticket buyers the option to purchase ticket insurance and are exploring several relevant adjacencies that seek to add value to the customer experience.
 •Distribution Partners. We allow our distribution partners to offer event tickets to their existing customers by leveraging our technology, fulfillment and customer service capabilities.
 •Content Rights Holders Partners. Teams, leagues and venues engage with us in partnerships in which we receive certain marketing or advertising rights in exchange for a monetary commitment. We may also receive ticket allotments, or the right to purchase tickets, from these partners.
 We will continue to seek out mutually beneficial partnerships in our existing ecosystem and other categories that improve the experience for our customers while leveraging our existing brand, traffic and reputation.
 Our Platform
 Modern Technology that Delivers a Seamless Experience
 Our “built in the cloud” technology platform supports all elements of the customer experience. Customers can search for an event, buy or sell a ticket, engage with curated content, and contact customer support. Our technology mission is to continually innovate and deliver market-leading products and services that support the evolving needs and preferences of ticket buyers, ticket sellers and daily fantasy sports users. Our scalable, reliable and performant systems power a consumer and partner-facing platform that supports ticket buyers while our tools power inventory management and ticket fulfillment for ticket sellers.
Buyer Technology and Products
 Our consumer systems are designed to respond to the dynamic, fast-paced landscape of the live events industry. Our marketplace, supported by proprietary digital marketing technology, is adept at capitalizing on demand opportunities by bringing ticket buyers to our platform for their desired event and seamlessly supporting their shopping and checkout experience. We continually invest in optimizing our consumer-facing technology across our website and mobile applications. We see opportunities to create engaging and delightful experiences through a wide range of event ticket listings, relevant content, curated recommendations and a seamless checkout process. We power that experience through a host of technology systems that consider historical transactional and engagement behavior, proximity and ticket buyer preferences. We leverage the latest technologies in search, customer relationship management and data analytics and incorporate these capabilities into our advanced and flexible infrastructure.
Seller Technology and Products
 Skybox, our premier ERP, enables ticket sellers to manage, price and fulfill their inventory. Utilizing a cloud-based technology infrastructure and a web-based application interface, Skybox serves as an asset to the entire ticket seller ecosystem. We invest in building capabilities that serve the needs of small, medium and large ticket sellers alike, including offering free integrations to other inventory distribution channels and third-party tools. Skybox allows ticket sellers to more effectively move their inventory, which in turn helps to increase the number of orders transacted in our marketplace.
Partner Technology and Products


Our platform allows distribution partners to bring additional ticket buyer demand into our ecosystem. Distribution partners can integrate our event feeds and ticket listings into their online properties through application programming interfaces (“APIs”) or fully-managed web sites. We also provide turn-key checkout, customer service and fulfillment. This offering increases the number of ticket buyers and sellers accessing our platform, allowing us to leverage our scale to drive operational and marketplace efficiencies while enabling our partners to offer additional products to their customers.
Technology Infrastructure
 Our platform is extensible and flexible. We can integrate with new partners, target new customer channels, access new supply bases, and connect with complementary technologies.
 We have scalable and reliable systems. We continue to build and modernize our technology infrastructure to support the growth of our marketplace. We can handle increases from unpredictable surges in site traffic across our ticket buyer, seller and partner platform. We utilize a host of technology availability, monitoring and scaling solutions to respond to rapid changes for a business that operates around the clock.
 Our technology architecture is service-oriented, cloud-based, and modular. Each individual component of our architecture is independent. We can innovate quickly, increase development velocity and leverage new development technologies available in the market. We can also scale our platform to meet changing levels of ticket buyer demand and evolving ticket seller needs.
 Third-Party Developers
 Our APIs allow a broad ecosystem of third-party tools and systems to integrate with our platform. Third-party tools integrate with our marketplace ticket broker API and ticket broker portal to streamline and automate the sales and fulfillment process. Our Skybox ERP integrates with numerous third-party automation and workflow management solutions. Thus, ticket sellers can leverage other applications and functions to support the specific needs of their business.
 Our Values
 Our passion and excitement for live events drives us to provide memorable experiences and services to our customers and partners.
 Our values ground us in all that we do:
 •We Create Exceptional Experiences. Whether we are engaging with a customer, partner or teammate, we do not compromise when it comes to their experience. We hold ourselves accountable and lean into every connection to make the moment count.
 •We Raise the Bar. We shape our industry. We are ambitious and disciplined teammates who make smart plays and get better every day.
 •We Commit as a Team. We are one team that trusts and supports each other, and we are ready to tackle the most difficult challenges.
 •We Embrace Change. The only constant is change; we are ready for it. As a team, we are energized by working with speed and agility to anticipate both the known and unknown.
 •We Enhance Communities. We invest in our communities. We are united in raising awareness around causes close to our hearts and are passionate about giving back. We are proud to partner with national and local community organizations including Make-A-Wish®, MusiCares, Chicago’s Lurie Children’s Hospital and Ronald McDonald house where our employees have provided care packages, donated wish list gifts, and hosted patients and families at live events. We, and our ticket buyers, have been proud to support MusiCares, the Recording Academy’s charity, and their efforts to provide relief for the live events community which is vital in bringing to life those events that are cherished by fans across the 


country. We have donated more than $2 million since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to help strengthen MusiCares’ relief efforts. In 2022, through our charitable foundation Vivid Cheers, we launched a partnership with Make-A-Wish®, the global organization responsible for creating life-changing wishes for children with critical illnesses. Through this partnership we have pledged $250,000 to share once in a lifetime experiences with children and families in their time of need.
Employees and Human Capital
 We are passionate about facilitating amazing experiences for our customers and we are similarly intent on providing compelling experiences for our employees. In 2022 we were named to Built In Chicago’s Best Places to Work and Fast Company’s Best Workplaces for Innovators lists. Our employees give us a competitive advantage. To support our employees, we have built a company culture that empowers them to embrace challenges, collaborate freely and seek to constantly evolve. We strive to hire talented, dedicated and diverse team members. As of December 31, 2022, we had 575 full-time employees, with most of our employees based at one of our three office locations in Chicago, Illinois; Coppell, Texas; and Toronto, Canada.
The main objectives of our human capital resources are identifying, recruiting, developing, incentivizing and retaining our existing and new employees. Our talent management team identifies key positions based on current and future business strategies and creates robust programs for talent development, including evaluating bench strength, building redundancy, and identifying potential successors. In addition to providing an engaging work environment, we provide a robust assortment of benefits including healthcare and retirement programs, flexible paid time off, paid parental leave, wellness programs, in-office and remote working perks, and ticket discounts.
Competition
 Our business faces significant competition from other primary and secondary ticketing service providers to acquire new and retain existing ticket buyers and sellers. Our main competitive factors are:
 •availability and variety of ticket offerings; 
 •pricing, including pricing in the primary ticket market;
 •acquiring customer traffic by way of internet search engines impacting customer acquisition and marketing costs;
 •brand recognition; and
 •technology, including functionality and ease of use to search for offerings and complete a purchase.
 We have several competitive advantages that enable us to maintain and grow our position as a leading secondary ticket provider:
 •wide selection of listings and ticketing options;
 •competitive pricing; 
 •Vivid Seats Rewards, the most comprehensive loyalty program among our key competitors;
 •full-service marketplace with excellent customer service;
 •proprietary performance marketing algorithms supported by first-party and real-time data;
 •scale, profitable unit economics and strong balance sheet;
 •close relationships with, and excellent customer service provided to, our professional ticket sellers and
 •free-to-use Skybox ERP for professional ticket sellers, the most widely adopted in the industry.
 Our key competitors are StubHub, Ticketmaster, SeatGeek and TicketNetwork.


With our real money daily fantasy sports offering on our Vivid Picks app, we face a highly competitive gaming market, including other free-to-play and real money online gaming and daily fantasy sports providers. We provide a differentiated product and experience to users with an easy-to-use app with simple player props. The app is enhanced by social and gamification features, the opportunity to play and win real money and the availability to purchase tickets directly in the app.
We also face competition from other avenues for entertainment. Consumers have a wide array of entertainment options including restaurants, movies and television and we compete for the discretionary spend of our ticket buyers and daily fantasy sports users.
Government Regulation
 Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. These laws and regulations involve:
 •privacy, 
 •data protection, 
 •intellectual property, 
 •competition, 
 •consumer protection, 
 •ticketing, 
 •payments, 
 •export taxation, and 
 •sports gaming. 
 For example, we are required to comply with federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data, an area that is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions, including the California Consumer Privacy Act.
 From time to time, federal, state, local and international authorities and/or consumers commence investigations, inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection, advertising, unfair business practice, antitrust (and similar or related laws) and other laws, particularly as related to ticket resale services. Some jurisdictions prohibit the resale of event tickets at prices above the face value of the tickets or at all, or highly regulate the resale of tickets. New laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations could limit or inhibit our ability to operate, or our ticket buyers’ and sellers’ ability to continue to use, our ticket marketplace. For example, New York amended its Arts and Cultural Affairs Law to require additional disclosures by ticket marketplaces and restricted a ticket marketplace’s ability to charge fees for the e-delivery of tickets.
 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a high volume of event reschedules, postponements, and cancellations and made certain changes to our refund practices. Although we have restored our refund policies to be consistent with our policies pre-pandemic, such changes to our refund practices have drawn the attention of, and inquiry from, various attorneys general and other regulators.
 We are subject to laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet in many jurisdictions where we operate. With the continued state adoption of internet sales tax laws and marketplace facilitator laws, more buyers across the United States will encounter sales tax on our platform in the future. Tax collection responsibility and the additional costs associated with complex sales and use tax collection, remittance and audit requirements could create additional burdens for ticket buyers and sellers on our website and mobile applications.


Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Compliance with these laws, regulations, and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and variances and inconsistencies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction may further increase the cost of compliance and doing business.
 Intellectual Property
 Our business relies substantially on the creation, use and protection of intellectual property related to our platform and services. We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, domain names, copyrights and trade secrets, and we are currently pursuing patent protection in connection with certain technology developments. We further protect our intellectual property through contractual provisions with employees, customers, suppliers, partners, affiliates and others, including, but not limited to, employee confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements, and commercial contracts that protect our intellectual property and other confidential information.
Seasonality
 Our financial results can be impacted by seasonality, with increased activity in the fourth quarter when all major sports leagues are in season and we experience an increase in order volume for theater events during the holiday season and concert on-sales for the subsequent year.
Corporate Information
 Vivid Seats was founded in 2001, and in 2004, we launched our website www.vividseats.com. In 2010, we launched our marketplace platform, which we scaled rapidly while we developed and refined our proprietary systems to enable us to best serve our customers. We launched Skybox in 2014, a free-to-use cloud-based ERP tool for sellers to manage their business, and first deployed our mobile application in 2015 to capture the increasing volume of tickets purchased through mobile channels. In 2019, we launched our loyalty program, and have since focused on building long-term customer value thorough brand affinity and a differentiated value proposition.
 In March of 2021, we incorporated an entity in Delaware for the purpose of completing the transactions contemplated by the transaction agreement dated April 21, 2021 (the “Transaction Agreement”) among Horizon Acquisition Corporation (“Horizon”), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, Horizon Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Horizon Sponsor”), Hoya Intermediate, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Hoya Intermediate”), and Hoya Topco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Hoya Topco”).
 In October 2021, as contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, Horizon merged with us (the “Merger Transaction”), upon which the separate corporate existence of Horizon ended and we remained as the surviving entity. At the same time, we became a publicly traded company listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) with our Class A common stock trading under the symbol "SEAT" and warrants trading under the symbol "SEATW."
