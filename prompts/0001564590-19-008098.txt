Overview
 Addus HomeCare Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 2006 under the name Addus Holding Corporation for the purpose of acquiring Addus HealthCare, Inc. (“Addus HealthCare”). Addus HealthCare was founded in 1979. We are a home care services provider operating in three segments: personal care; hospice; and home health. Our services are principally provided in the home under agreements with federal, state and local government agencies. Our consumers are predominantly “dual eligible,” meaning they are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits.
 As of December 31, 2018, we provided services to over 39,000 consumers in 24 states through 156 offices. Our payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we served approximately 57,000, 51,000 and 50,000 discrete consumers, respectively. Our personal care segment also includes staffing services, with clients including assisted living facilities, nursing homes and hospice facilities.
 A summary of our financial results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 is provided in the table below.

 Our services and operating model address a number of crucial needs across the healthcare continuum. Care provided in the home generally costs less than facility-based care and is typically preferred by consumers and their families. By providing services in the home to the elderly and others who require long-term care and support with the activities of daily living, we lower the cost of chronic and acute care treatment by delaying or eliminating the need for care in more expensive settings. In addition, our caregivers observe and report changes in the condition of our consumers for the purpose of facilitating early intervention in the disease process, which often reduces the cost of medical services by preventing unnecessary emergency room visits and/or hospital admissions and re-admissions. We coordinate the services provided by our team with those of other healthcare providers and payors as appropriate. Changes in a consumer’s conditions are evaluated by appropriately trained managers and may result in a report to the consumer’s case manager at a managed care organization or other payor. By providing care in the preferred setting of the home and by providing opportunities to improve the consumer’s conditions and allow early intervention as indicated, our model also is designed to improve consumer outcomes and satisfaction.
 We believe our model provides significant value to managed care organizations. States are increasingly implementing managed care programs for Medicaid enrollees, and as a result managed care organizations have been increasingly responsible for the healthcare needs and the related healthcare costs of our consumers. Managed care organizations have an economic incentive to better manage the healthcare expenditures of their members, lower costs and improve outcomes. We believe that our model is well positioned to assist in meeting those goals while also improving consumer satisfaction, and, as a result, we expect increased referrals from managed care organizations. 
 Beginning January 1, 2019, a final rule of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), allows Medicare Advantage insurers to offer beneficiaries more options and new benefits. Through this rule, CMS has redefined health-related supplemental benefits to include services that increase health and improve quality of life, including coverage of non-skilled in-home care. This policy change, emphasizing improving quality and reducing costs, aligns with our overall approach to care, and we believe the increased demand for personal care from the Medicare Advantage population represents a significant upside opportunity over the next three to five years.
 We utilize Interactive Voice Response (“IVR”) systems and smart phone applications to communicate with the majority of our aides. Through these technologies, our aides are able to report changes in health conditions to an appropriate manager for triage and evaluation. In addition, we use these technologies to record basic information about each visit, record start and end times for a 
 2


scheduled shift, track mileage reimbursement, send text messages to the aide and communicate basic payroll information. In addition to our organic growth, we have been growing through acquisitions that have expanded our presence in current markets or facilitated our entry into new markets where the personal care business has primarily been moving to managed care organizations. 
 In 2013, we sold substantially all of the assets of our then home health skilled nursing business (the “2013 Home Health Business”) in Arkansas, Nevada, South Carolina and Pennsylvania, and 90% of the 2013 Home Health Business in California and Illinois. Effective October 1, 2017, we sold our remaining 10% ownership interest in the 2013 Home Health Business in California and Illinois. The results of the 2013 Home Health Business sold are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein. We maintain licensure as a Medicare home health agency in Ohio and Delaware in connection with providing services in those states. With the purchase of Ambercare Corporation (“Ambercare”), completed in the second quarter of 2018, we now maintain licensure as a Medicare home health and hospice agency in New Mexico. 
 Our Market and Opportunity
 We provide personal care services to the elderly and other infirm adults who require long-term care and assistance with activities of daily living. Personal care services are a significant component of home and community-based services (“HCBS”), which have grown in significance and demand in recent years. Demand for personal care services is expected to continue to grow due to the aging of the U.S. population, increased life expectancy, and improved opportunities for individuals to receive home-based care as an alternative to institutional care. The population over the age of 65 nationally has been growing at a consistent rate for the past five years and the U.S. Census Bureau estimates are that this demographic will more than double by 2050. 
 Reported federal and state Medicaid expenditures for fee-for-service personal care services amounted to over $29.9 billion in calendar year 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, reflecting an increase of $1.9 billion from 2015.
 Many states use both fee-for-service and managed care delivery models for personal care services, and the number of beneficiaries served through managed care continues to grow. As of July 2018, 39 states contracted with risk-based managed care organizations to serve their Medicaid enrollees, with 20 of those states enrolling at least 75% of all elderly beneficiaries or those with disabilities in managed care organizations. In 24 states, some or all long-term services and support is covered through Medicaid managed care arrangements. 
 In addition to the projected growth of government-sponsored personal care services, the private pay market for our services continues to expand. We offer our private pay consumers the same services that we provide to our government-sponsored personal care consumers.
 Historically, there were limited barriers to entry in the personal care services industry. As a result, the personal care services industry developed in a highly fragmented manner, with many small local providers. Few companies have a significant market share across multiple regions or states. The lack of licensure or certification requirements in some states makes it difficult to estimate the number of personal care services agencies. 
 The personal care services industry has become subject to increased regulation. At the federal level, recent efforts have focused on improved coordination of regulation across the various types of Medicaid programs through which personal care services are offered. For example, the 21st Century Cures Act, as amended, mandates that states implement electronic visit verification (“EVV”) by January 1, 2020, which will be used to collect home visit data, such as when the visit begins and ends. In several states, providers are now required to obtain state licenses or registrations and must comply with laws and regulations governing standards of practice. Providers must dedicate substantial resources to ensure continuing compliance with all applicable regulations and significant expenditures may be necessary to offer new services or to expand into new markets. The failure to comply with regulatory requirements could lead to the termination of rights to participate in federal and state-sponsored programs and the suspension or revocation of licenses. We believe new licensing requirements and regulations, including EVV, the increasing focus on improving health outcomes, the rising cost and complexity of operations, technology and pressure on reimbursement rates due to constrained government resources may discourage new providers and may encourage industry consolidation.
 The Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office (“MMCO”) was established within CMS to effectively improve services for consumers who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, also known as dual eligibles, and improve coordination between the federal government and states to enhance access to quality services to which they are entitled. The MMCO works with state Medicaid agencies, other federal and state agencies, physicians and others, to make available technical assistance and educational tools to improve care coordination between Medicare and Medicaid and to reduce costs and improve beneficiary experience while reducing administrative and regulatory barriers between the programs. For example, the Financial Alignment Initiative is a demonstration project that tests capitated models and managed fee-for-service models of integrated care and payment for benefits provided to dual eligibles.
 We believe that our personal care program and our technology make us well-suited to partner with managed care organizations to address the needs of the dual eligible population. We believe that our ability to identify changes in our consumers’ health and 
 3


condition before acute intervention is required will lower the overall cost of care. We believe this approach to care delivery and the integration of our services into the broader healthcare continuum are particularly attractive to managed care organizations and others who are ultimately responsible for the healthcare needs of our consumers and over time will increase our business with them.
 Our Growth Strategy
 Our net service revenues growth is closely correlated with the number of consumers to whom we provide our services. Our continued growth depends on our ability to provide consistently high quality care, maintain our existing payor relationships, establish relationships with new payors and increase our referral sources. Our continued growth is also dependent upon the authorization by state agencies of new consumers to receive our services. We believe there are several market opportunities for growth. The U.S. population of persons aged 65 and older is growing, and the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that this population will more than double by 2050. Additionally, we believe the overwhelming majority of individuals in need of care generally prefer to receive care in their homes. Finally, we believe the provision of personal care services is more cost-effective than the provision of similar services in institutional settings for long-term care. We plan to continue our revenue growth and margin improvement and enhance our competitive positioning by executing on the following growth strategies:
 Consistently provide high-quality care 
 We schedule and require our caregivers to perform their services as defined within the individual plan of care. We monitor the performance of our caregivers through regular supervisory visits in the homes of consumers. Our caregivers are provided with pre-service training and orientation and an evaluation of their skills. In many cases, caregivers are also required to attend ongoing in-service education. In certain states, our caregivers are required to complete certified training programs and maintain a state certification. The training provided assists to identify changes in our consumers’ health and condition before acute intervention is required, which we believe lowers the overall cost of care.
 Drive Organic Growth in Existing Markets
 We intend to drive organic growth through several initiatives, including building our sales capabilities, increasing our interaction with referral sources, enhancing our business intelligence capabilities and expanding relationships with payors in our markets. We also expect our organic growth will benefit from an increase in demand for our services by an aging population. We also are prepared to selectively open new offices in existing markets when an opportunity is identified and appropriate.
Market to Managed Care Organizations
 As a scaled, national provider of home-based care, we can grow by partnering with managed care organizations, taking advantage of an industry shift away from traditional fee-for-service Medicaid and toward managed care models, which aim to better coordinate care. We expect this shift to lead to narrower provider networks where we can be competitive by offering a larger, more experienced partner to these organizations, as well as by providing more sophisticated technology, electronic visit records and an outcomes-driven approach to service. We believe our coordinated care model and integration of services into the broader healthcare industry are particularly attractive to managed care organizations.
Grow through Acquisitions
 In 2018, we completed three acquisitions. Through the Ambercare acquisition, completed in the second quarter of 2018, we acquired the businesses that comprise our hospice and home health segments. Our acquisition pipeline and strong financial position support additional acquisitions. With rising consolidation pressures in the industry, our focus is on identifying growing markets with favorable demographics in states that are fiscally well managed and have a reasonable minimum wage environment and where we have the potential to become one of the leading providers in the state in order to support our managed care organization strategy. We believe our experience identifying and executing on acquisition opportunities, as well as our history of integrating acquisitions, will lead to additional growth. 
Grow in Complementary Businesses
 In 2018, we expanded and diversified into hospice and home health via our Ambercare acquisition. Entry into these business lines allows us to broaden our range of services in existing markets, while achieving further economies of scale and taking advantage of our home-focused management and operational capabilities. We anticipate having further opportunities to expand these segments by acquisition, with a particular focus on hospice care.

Our Services
 As of December 31, 2018, we delivered services to our consumers in 24 states through 156 individual agencies. Our services, which include non-medical personal care services, are provided to consumers who are unable to independently perform some or all of their activities of daily living. Without our services, many of our consumers would be at increased risk of placement in a long-term care institution. With the acquisition of Ambercare completed during the second quarter of 2018, we began to report our business with two additional segments, hospice and home health. Prior to the Ambercare acquisition, we operated one business segment as a provider of personal care services. 
Personal Care
 Our personal care segment provides non-medical assistance with activities of daily living, primarily to persons who are at increased risk of hospitalization or institutionalization, such as the elderly, chronically ill or disabled. The services we provide include assistance with bathing, grooming, oral care, assistance with feeding and dressing, medication reminders, meal planning and preparation, housekeeping and transportation services. Many consumers need such services on a long-term basis to address chronic or acute conditions. Each payor client establishes its own eligibility standards, determines the type, amount, duration and scope of services, and establishes the applicable reimbursement rate in accordance with applicable law, regulations or contracts.
Hospice
 Our hospice segment provides physical, emotional and spiritual care for people who are terminally ill as well as for their families. The hospice services we provide include palliative nursing care, social work, spiritual counseling, homemaker services and bereavement counseling. Generally, patients receiving hospice services have a life expectancy of six months or less.
Home Health
 Our home health segment provides services that are primarily medical in nature to individuals who may require assistance during an illness or after surgery and include skilled nursing and physical, occupational and speech therapy. We generally provide home health services on a short-term, intermittent or episodic basis to individuals, typically to assist patients recovering from an illness or injury.
Our Payors
 Our payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. The federal, state and local programs under which these organizations operate are subject to legislative, budgetary and other risks that can influence reimbursement rates. Managed care organizations that operate as an extension of our state payors are subject to similar economic pressures. Our commercial insurance payor clients are typically for profit companies and are continuously seeking opportunities to control costs.
 Most of our services are provided pursuant to agreements with state and local governmental social and aging service agencies. These agreements generally have an initial term of one to two years and may be terminated with 60 days’ notice. They are typically renewed for one to five-year terms, provided that we have complied with licensing, certification and program standards, and other regulatory requirements. Reimbursement rates and methods vary by state and service type, but are typically based on an hourly or unit-of-service basis. Managed care organizations are becoming an increasing portion of our personal care segment payor mix as states shift from administering fee-for-service programs to utilizing managed care models. In our personal care segment during 2018, approximately 58.2% of our net service revenues were derived from state and local government programs, with 35.3% derived from managed care organizations, while approximately 4.1% and 1.3% of net service revenues were derived from private pay consumers and commercial insurance programs, respectively.

For 2018, 2017 and 2016, our revenue mix by payor type was as follows:

We derive a significant amount of our net service revenues from our operations in Illinois, New York and New Mexico. The percentages of total revenue for each of these significant states for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:
 
 
 | % of Total Revenue for the Years Ended December, 31 | 
-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+------
State | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Personal Care | | | | | | | | 
Illinois | | 47.5 | % | 52.6 | | % | 53.6 | %
New York | | 13.2 | | 8.8 | | | 12.9 | 
New Mexico | | 12.0 | | 13.7 | | | 7.5 | 
All other states | | 27.3 | | 24.9 | | | 26.0 |

New Mexico | | 100.0 | | — | | | — | 
Home Health | | | | | | | | 
New Mexico | | 100.0 | | — | | | — | 

 
A significant amount of our net service revenues from our personal care segment are derived from one specific payor client, the Illinois Department on Aging, which accounted for 31.0%, 36.5% and 42.1% of our total net service revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Illinois Department on Aging’s payments for non-Medicaid consumers have been delayed in the past and may be delayed in the future in the event of budget disputes. The state of Illinois did not adopt comprehensive budgets for fiscal years 2016 or 2017, ending June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2017, respectively. On July 6, 2017, the state of Illinois passed a budget for state fiscal year 2018, which began on July 1, 2017, authorizing the Illinois Department on Aging to pay for our services rendered to non-Medicaid consumers provided in prior fiscal years. As of December 31, 2018, we have received substantially all such payments. On June 4, 2018, the state of Illinois passed a budget for state fiscal year 2019, which began on July 1, 2018.
 In December 2014, the Chicago City Council passed an ordinance that will raise the minimum wage for Chicago workers to $13 per hour by 2019, with increases up to $1 per hour effective on July 1 of each year. The rate is $12 per hour effective July 1, 2018. The wage increase in 2016 did not have a material impact on our financial results because of our existing wage scale. The 2017 wage increase was offset by a reimbursement rate increase. In the budget process for the 2019 fiscal year, a similar provision was proposed but was not included in the final budget. We believe that there is legislative support for a reimbursement rate increase and anticipate that an increase to offset the wage increase could be passed in the first half of 2019. Our financial performance will be impacted in quarters for which a reimbursement rate increase is not in effect.
 We also measure the performance of each segment using a number of different metrics. For the personal care segment these include billable hours, billable hours per business day, revenues per billable hour and the number of consumers, or census. For the hospice segment these include admissions, average daily census, average length of stay and revenue per patient day. For the home health segment these include admissions, recertifications, total volume, and number of visits, completed episodes and average revenue per completed episode.

Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive, fragmented and market specific. Each local market has its own competitive profile and no single competitor has significant market share across all of our markets. Our competition consists of personal care service providers, home health providers, private caregivers, larger publicly held companies, privately held companies, privately held single-site agencies, hospital-based agencies, not-for-profit organizations, community-based organizations, managed care organizations and self-directed care programs. In addition, certain governmental payors contract for services with independent providers such that our relationships with these payors are not exclusive. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition from new entrants into our markets. Increased competition may result in pricing pressures, loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of consumers or payors, any of which could harm our business. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, political and marketing resources, and name recognition with consumers and payors.
Sales and Marketing
 We focus on initiating and maintaining working relationships with state and local governmental agencies responsible for the provision of the services we offer. We target these agencies in our current markets and in geographical areas that we have identified as potential markets for expansion. We also seek to identify service needs or changes in the service delivery or reimbursement system of governmental entities and attempt to work with and provide input to the responsible government personnel, provider associations and consumer advocacy groups.
 We establish new referral relationships with various managed care organizations that contract with the states for the servicing of the state Medicaid programs. We have met with many contracted managed care organizations in markets where we serve our clients and believe we are building the relationships necessary to ensure continued referrals of new clients.
 We receive substantially all of our consumers through third-party referrals, including state departments on aging, rehabilitation, mental health and children’s services, county departments of social services, the Veterans Health Administration and city departments on aging. Generally, family members of potential consumers are made aware of available in-home or alternative living arrangements through a state or local case management system. These systems are operated by governmental or private agencies. 
 We provide ongoing education and outreach in our target communities in order to inform the community about state and locally-subsidized care options and to communicate our role in providing quality personal care services. We also utilize consumer-directed sales, marketing and advertising programs designed to attract consumers. With respect to our hospice and home health patients, we receive substantially all of our referrals through other health care providers, such as hospitals, physicians, nursing homes and assisted living facilities. We have a team of community liaisons in our hospice and home health operations that educate and develop relationships with other health care providers and the community at large.
 Payment for Services
 We are reimbursed for substantially all of our services by federal, state and local government programs, such as Medicaid state programs, other state agencies and the Veterans Health Administration. In addition, we are reimbursed by managed care organizations, commercial insurance and private pay consumers. Depending on the type of service, coverage for services may be predicated on a case manager, physician or nurse determination that the care is necessary or on the development of a plan for care in the home. A significant amount of our net service revenues from our personal care segment are derived from one specific payor client, the Illinois Department on Aging, which accounted for 31.0%, 36.5% and 42.1% of our total net service revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Illinois Department on Aging
 We provide personal care services pursuant to agreements with the Illinois Department on Aging, which coordinates programs and community-based services intended to improve quality of life and preserve the independence of older individuals. The Illinois Department on Aging is funded by Medicaid and general revenue funds of the state of Illinois, and also receives funding available under the Federal Older Americans Act (“OAA”). The Department on Aging’s Community Care Program (“CCP”) provides case management, adult day service, emergency home response and homemaker services to individuals age 60 and over. Some of these services are provided through Medicaid waivers granted by CMS. Enrollment in the CCP has grown significantly over the last ten years due to the aging of the population in Illinois.
 Consumers are identified by case managers contracted independently with the Illinois Department on Aging. Once a consumer has been evaluated and determined to be eligible for a program, an assigned case manager refers the consumer to a list of authorized providers, from which the consumer selects the provider. We provide our services in accordance with a care plan developed by the case manager and under administrative directives from the Illinois Department on Aging. We are reimbursed on an hourly fee-for-service basis. The state of Illinois’s payments for non-Medicaid consumers have been delayed in the past due to budget disputes that began in 2015. The state of Illinois did not adopt a comprehensive budget for fiscal years 2016 or 2017, but did adopt a 
 7


comprehensive budget in 2018 and 2019. On November 6, 2018, Illinois elected a new governor. The new governor is expected to be more aligned with the General Assembly; therefore, the likelihood of a future budget impasse and corresponding delay in payments may be reduced. 
 Other Federal, State and Local Payors
 Medicare
 Medicare is a federal program that provides medical services to persons aged 65 or older and other qualified persons with disabilities or end-stage renal disease. Each of our hospice and home care agencies must comply with the extensive conditions of participation in the Medicare program in order to continue receiving Medicare reimbursement. 
 Medicare beneficiaries who have a terminal illness and a life expectancy of six months or less may elect to receive hospice benefits (i.e., palliative services for management of a terminal illness) in lieu of standard Medicare coverage for treatment. Hospice services are paid under the Medicare Hospice Prospective Payment System (“HPPS”), under which CMS sets a daily rate for each day a patient is enrolled in the hospice benefit. Hospice payment rates increased by 1.8% in federal fiscal year 2019, which reflects a 2.9% market basket update; a negative 0.8% multifactor productivity adjustment; and a negative 0.3% adjustment required by the ACA. Additionally, hospice companies are subject to two specific payment limit caps under the Medicare program each federal fiscal year: the inpatient cap and the aggregate cap. The inpatient cap limits the number of inpatient care days provided to no more than 20% of the total days of hospice care provided to Medicare patients for the year. If a hospice exceeds the number of inpatient care days, the hospice must refund any amounts received for inpatient care that exceed the total of: (i) the product of the total reimbursement paid to the hospice for inpatient care multiplied by the ratio of the maximum number of allowable inpatient days to the actual number of inpatient care days furnished by the hospice to Medicare patients; and (ii) the product of the number of actual inpatient days in excess of the limitation multiplied by the limitation by the routine home care rate. The aggregate cap, which is calculated each federal fiscal year, limits the amount of Medicare reimbursement a hospice may receive, based on the number of Medicare patients served. If a hospice’s Medicare payments exceed its aggregate cap, it must repay Medicare for the excess amount. In 2019, the aggregate cap is $29,205.  
 Home health services for homebound patients are paid under the Medicare Home Health Prospective Payment System (“HHPPS”), which is currently based on a 60-day episode of care as a unit of service. The HHPPS permits multiple, continuous episodes per patient. Medicare payment rates for episodes under HHPPS vary based on the severity of the patient’s condition as determined by assessment of a patient’s Home Health Resource Group score. CMS updates the HHPPS payment rates each calendar year. In 2019, HHPPS rates will increase by 2.2%, which includes a 2.2% home health payment update; a 0.1% increase due to a decrease of the fixed-dollar-loss ratio in order to pay no more than 2.5% of total payments as outlier payments; and a 0.1% reduction due to a new rural add-on policy mandated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also requires CMS to use a 30-day episode of care and implement the Patient-Driven Groupings Model (“PDGM”) beginning in January 1, 2020. The PDGM model will replace the current case-mix system, which uses the number of visits to determine payment, and will classify patients based on clinical characteristics. The PDGM is intended to shift toward a value-based payment system and remove the incentive to overprovide care. 
 CMS requires both hospice and home health providers to submit quality reporting data each year. Hospice and home health providers that do not comply are subject to a 2% reduction to their market basket update.  
 Medicaid Programs 
 Medicaid is a state-administered program that provides certain social and medical services to qualified low-income individuals and is jointly funded by the federal government and individual states. Reimbursement rates and methods vary by state and service type, but are typically based on an hourly or unit-of-service basis. Rates are subject to adjustment based on statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, government funding limitations and interpretations of policy by individual state agencies. Within guidelines established by federal statutes and regulations, and subject to federal oversight, each state establishes its own eligibility standards, determines the type, amount, duration and scope of services, sets the rate of payment for services and administers its own program. States typically cover Medicaid beneficiaries for intermittent home health services as well as continuous services for children and young adults with complicated medical conditions and cover home and community-based services for seniors and people with disabilities.
 Many states are moving the administration of their Medicaid and Medicare personal care programs to managed care organizations. This transition is due to an overall desire to better manage the costs of the Medicaid long term care programs. In addition, hospice and home health services are also provided by managed care organizations. Reimbursement from the managed care organizations for personal care services is generally on an hourly, fee-for-service basis with rates consistent with or as a percentage of the individual state funded rates.
 8


Currently, personal care services and other HCBS are largely reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis. States receive permission from CMS to provide personal care services under waivers of traditional Medicaid requirements. In an effort to control escalating Medicaid costs, states are increasingly requiring Medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in managed care plans for better coordination of HCBS and health care services. A report issued by the Illinois Department on Aging in 2016 indicates that over 60% of the state’s Medicaid population is enrolled in a care coordination program, many of which are provided through various managed care entities including managed care organizations. In January 2018, Illinois began transitioning Medicaid beneficiaries to the Health Choice Illinois statewide managed care program, which is serviced by various managed care organizations. The Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services expected that managed care would expand through the Health Choice Illinois program to reach approximately 80% of Medicaid enrollees. In March of 2018, the Department of Healthcare and Family Services announced a delay of enrollment for certain Medicaid beneficiaries receiving long term care services. It is unclear at this time when enrollment in HealthChoice Illinois will begin for these beneficiaries.
 Veterans Health Administration
 The Veterans Health Administration operates the nation’s largest integrated healthcare system, with more than 1,900 sites of care, and provides healthcare benefits, including personal care, hospice and home health services, to eligible military veterans. The Veterans Health Administration provides funding to regional and local offices and facilities that support the in-home care needs of eligible aged and disabled veterans. Services are funded by local Veterans Medical Centers and the aid and attendance pension, which reimburses veterans for their otherwise unreimbursed health and long-term care expenses. We currently have relationships and agreements with the Veterans Health Administration to provide personal care services in several states, with the most Veterans Health Administration services being provided to eligible consumers in Illinois, Tennessee and California.
Other
 Other sources of funding are available to support personal care, hospice and home health services in different states and localities. In addition, many states appropriate general funds or special use funds through targeted taxes or lotteries to finance personal care services for senior citizens and individuals with disabilities. Depending on the state, these funds may be used to supplement existing Medicaid programs or for distinct programs that serve non-Medicaid eligible consumers.
Commercial Insurance
 Most long-term care insurance policies contain benefits for in-home services. Policies are generally subject to dollar limitations on the amount of daily, weekly or monthly coverage provided.
Private Pay
 Our private pay services are provided on an hourly or type of services basis. Our rates are established to achieve a pre-determined gross margin, and are competitive with those of other local providers. We bill our private pay consumers for services rendered weekly, bi-monthly or monthly. Other private payors include workers’ compensation programs/insurance, preferred provider organizations and employers.
Insurance Programs and Costs
 We maintain workers’ compensation, general and professional liability, cyber, automobile, directors’ and officers’ liability, fiduciary liability and excess liability insurance. We offer various health insurance plans to eligible full-time and part-time employees. We believe our insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves are adequate for our current operations. However, we cannot be certain that any potential losses or asserted claims will not exceed such insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves.
Employees
 The following is a breakdown of our part- and full-time employees, including the employees in our national support center, as of December 31, 2018:
 
 
 | Full-time | | Part-time | | Total
-------------------------+-----------+-------+-----------+--------+------
Caregivers | | 4,597 | | 28,267 | | 32,864
National support centers | | 278 | | 11 | | 289 
 | | 4,875 | | 28,278 | | 33,153

 
Our caregivers provide substantially all of our services and comprise approximately 95.7% of our total workforce. They undergo a criminal background check and are provided with pre-service training and orientation and an evaluation of their skills. In many cases, caregivers are also required to attend ongoing in-service education. In certain states, our caregivers are required to complete 
 9


certified training programs and maintain a state certification. Approximately 49.0% of our total employees are represented by labor unions. We maintain strong working relationships with these labor unions. We have numerous collective bargaining agreements with the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”), which are renegotiated from time to time.
 Technology
 We currently utilize multiple applications to support our various lines of business and locations for patient accounting. For our legacy Addus locations and Ambercare, we utilize the Horizon Homecare software solution (“Horizon”). We recently purchased and implemented HomeCare Homebase to support these lines of business. All locations acquired through our recent purchase of operations of Arcadia Home Care & Staffing (“Arcadia”) utilize Continulink for their personal care and staffing business.
 Each of these applications support their respective lines of business and locations with administrative, office, clinical and operating information system needs, including assisting with the compliance of our operating systems with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, requirements. Each assists our staff in gathering information to improve the quality of consumer care, optimize financial performance, promote regulatory compliance and enhance staff efficiency. Each application is hosted by the vendor in a secure data center, which provides multiple redundancies for storage, power, bandwidth and security.  
 In order to comply with current and future state and future federal regulations around EVV use, we utilize several different vendors. In states with an “open” model, we are able to choose our vendor and have standardized Celltrak as our preferred EVV vendor. In states mandating the EVV vendor, a “closed” system, we utilize whichever vendor the state has mandated. In both cases, we have built interfaces between the EVV vendor and the patient accounting system utilized in the respective branch location. 
 We license the Qlik Business Intelligence platform to provide historical, current, and forward-looking operational performance analysis. We currently have our personal care business managed by Horizon and Continulink integrated into Qlikview to provide a comprehensive view of the business regardless of the application used. Qlik provides high-level historical and current analytical views to measure performance against budget and deliver insight into the various factors driving our execution against our financial, operational, and compliance goals. This analysis is available in summary and detailed views to accommodate user needs from senior management down to the operators in the field.
 We also utilize ADP for Talent Management and use their services and products to manage our leave of absence (“LOA”) processes, flexible spending account (“FSA”) administration, and time and attendance. As of December 31, 2018, we have implemented ADP Vantage for all our acquired businesses. ADP serves as our base Human Resources and Payroll Processing system.
 For Financial Management, we utilize Oracle’s Planning Budgeting Cloud Service (“PBCS”) as our solution for budgeting, forecasting, and financial reporting. Currently we use Sage MAS ERP software but will be converting to Oracle Fusion in the first half of 2019. Oracle Fusion will be our solution for general ledger, accounts payable, and fixed assets. 
 Government Regulation
 Overview
 Our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. Changes in the laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may have a material impact on the definition of permissible activities, the relative cost of doing business, and the methods and amounts of payment for care by both governmental and other payors. In addition, differences among state laws may impede our ability to expand into certain markets. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer administrative civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in federal or state programs. In addition, the healthcare industry has experienced, and is expected to continue to experience, extensive and dynamic change. It is difficult to predict the effect of these changes on budgetary allocations for our services. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview.”
 Medicare and Medicaid Participation
 To participate in and qualify for reimbursement under Medicare, our home health agencies and hospices must comply with extensive conditions of participation. Likewise, to participate in Medicaid programs, our personal care services, home health agencies and hospices are subject to various requirements imposed by federal and state authorities. If we were to violate the applicable federal and state regulations governing Medicare or Medicaid participation, we could be excluded from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and be subject to substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties.

Health Reform
 The U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have passed many laws and regulations in recent years intended to effect major change within the national healthcare system, the most prominent of which is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, “ACA”). As currently structured, the ACA affects how healthcare services are delivered and reimbursed through the expansion of public and private health insurance coverage, reduction of growth in Medicare and Medicaid program spending, and the establishment and expansion of programs that tie reimbursement to quality and integration. It includes several provisions that may affect reimbursement for our services. However, the fu
ture of the ACA is unclear. The law has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges, and the current presidential administration and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or make additional significant c
hanges to the ACA, its implementation or interpretation. For example
, in 2017, the President of the United States signed an executive order that directs agencies to minimize “economic and regulatory burdens” of the ACA
. Effective January 1, 2019, Congress eliminated the penalty associated with the individual mandate to maintain health insurance. Because the penalty associated with the individual mandate was eliminated, a federal judge in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the entire ACA was unconstitutional. However, the law remains in place pending appeal. These and other changes and court challenges may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. 
 The Affordable Care Act, as enacted, requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes effectively at or below 138% of the federal poverty level. However, states may opt out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. Some of the states use or have applied to use Medicaid waivers
 granted by CMS to implement expansion provisions, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. CMS administrators have indicated that they intend to increase state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid programs and states continue to explore payment and delivery reform initiatives, including beneficiary work requirements, and quality of care incentives. Enrollment in managed Medicaid plans has also increased in recent years, as state governments seek to control the cost of Medicaid programs. Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or more entities for patient enrollment, care management and claims adjudication. The states usually do not relinquish program responsibilities for financing, eligibility criteria and core benefit plan design.
 The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, or CMMI, tests innovative payment and service delivery systems to reduce program expenditures while maintaining or enhancing quality. For example, the CMMI has supported testing of new models of care for dual eligibles, funding of home health providers that offer chronic care management services, and establishment of pilot programs that bundle acute care hospital services with physician services and post-acute care services, which may include home health services for certain patients. These systems could have a material impact on our business. It is difficult to predict the nature and success of future financial or delivery system reforms implemented by CMMI and other industry participants.
 Permits, Licensure and Certificate of Need
 Our hospice, home health and personal care services are authorized and/or licensed under various state and county requirements, which cover a variety of topics including standards regarding the provision of medical or care services, clinical records, personnel, infection control and care plans. Additionally health care professionals at our agencies are required to be individually licensed or certified under state law. Although our personal care service caregivers are generally not subject to licensure requirements, certain states require them to complete pre and post-employment training programs, background checks, and, in certain instances, maintain state certification. We believe we are currently licensed appropriately as required by the laws of the states in which we operate in all material respects, but additional licensing requirements may be imposed upon us in existing markets or markets that we enter in the future.
 Some states also require a provider to obtain a certificate of need or permit of approval (“CON”) before establishing, constructing, acquiring or expanding certain health services, operations or facilities or making certain capital expenditures. In order to obtain a CON, a state health planning agency must determine that a need exists for the project, with the intent to avoid unnecessary duplication of services.

Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Anti-Kickback Laws: The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the offering, payment, solicitation or receipt of any remuneration to induce referrals or orders for items or services covered by federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and held that there is a violation if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals. Knowledge of the law or intent to violate the law is not required. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may be punished by criminal fines, imprisonment, significant civil monetary penalties plus damages of up to three times the total amount of remuneration involved and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may be subject to additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act. Many states have similar laws proscribing kickbacks, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for items or services.
 The Stark Law and other Prohibitions on Physician Self-Referral: The federal law commonly known as the “Stark Law” prohibits physicians from referring to an entity that provides certain “designated health services” covered by the Medicare and Medicaid program, including home health services, if they, or their family members, have a financial relationship with the entity receiving the referral, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health services reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid from billing these programs for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to a prohibited referral. Violations of the Stark Law may result in denial of payment, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim, which may result in additional penalties imposed under the federal False Claims Act. The statute and regulations also provide for a penalty of over $165,000 for a circumvention scheme. We attempt to structure our relationships, including compensation agreements with physicians who serve as medical directors in our home health agencies, to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but we cannot provide assurance that every relationship is fully compliant. Many states have also enacted statutes similar in scope and purpose to the Stark Law, although these laws may apply to all payors or a greater range of services.
 The False Claims Act: Numerous state and federal laws govern the submission of claims for reimbursement and prohibit false claims or statements. Under the federal False Claims Act, for example, the government may fine any person, company or corporation that knowingly presents or causes to be presented claims for payment to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, or which contain false or misleading information. “Knowingly” is defined broadly, and includes submission of a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity. The federal False Claims Act can be used to prosecute fraud involving issues such as coding errors and billing for services not provided. Violations of other statutes, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, can also serve as a basis for liability under the federal False Claims Act. Among other potential bases for liability is the knowing and improper failure to report and return overpayments received from Medicare or Medicaid in a timely manner following identification of the overpayment. An overpayment is deemed to be “identified” when a person has, or should have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment.
 A provider determined to be liable under the False Claims Act may be required to pay three times the amount of actual damages sustained by the federal government, in addition to mandatory civil monetary penalties that may amount to over $20,000 for each false or fraudulent claim. These penalties will be updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. Private parties may initiate whistleblower lawsuits alleging the defrauding of the federal government by a provider and may receive a share of any settlement or judgment. When a private individual brings an action under the federal False Claims Act, the defendant generally is not made aware of the lawsuit under the federal government commences its own investigation or determines whether it will intervene.
 Every entity that receives at least $5.0 million in Medicaid payments annually must have written policies regarding certain federal and state laws for all employees, contractors and agents. These policies must provide detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections.
 Many states have similar false claims statutes that impose additional liability for the types of acts prohibited by the False Claims Act.
 Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions: Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed under various other federal and state statutes that prohibit various forms of fraud and abuse, such as anti-kickback laws, prohibitions on self-referral, fee-splitting restrictions, insurance fraud laws, and false claims acts, which may extend to services reimbursable by any payer, including private insurers. For example, criminal penalties may be imposed upon any person or entity that knowingly and willfully defrauds a health care benefit plan, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense or makes a materially false statement in connection with delivery of or payment for health care services by a health care benefit plan. Further, the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMPL”) imposes substantial penalties for offering remuneration or other inducements to influence federal healthcare beneficiaries’ decisions to seek specific governmentally reimbursable items or services or to choose particular providers. It also imposes penalties for contracting with an individual or entity known to be excluded from a federal healthcare program. The CMPL requires a lower burden of proof than some other fraud and abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Civil monetary penalties are 
 12


updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. In addition to the financial penalties, federal enforcement officials are able to exclude from Medicare or Medicaid any individuals or entities convicted of Medicare or Medicaid fraud or other offenses related to the delivery of items or services under those programs. Persons who have been excluded from the Medicare or Medicaid program may not retain ownership in a participating entity. Participating entities that permit continued ownership by excluded individuals, that contract with excluded individuals, and the excluded individuals themselves, may be penalized.
 Payment Integrity
 We are subject to routine and periodic surveys and audits by various governmental agencies and other payors. From time to time, we receive and respond to survey reports containing statements of deficiencies. Periodic and random audits conducted or directed by these agencies could result in a delay in receipt or an adjustment to the amount of reimbursements due or received under federal or state programs.
 Under the Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program, CMS contracts with third parties to identify improper Medicare payments. RACs are paid a contingent fee based on the improper payments identified and corrected. CMS has also instituted Zone Program Integrity Contracts for additional audit of Medicare providers, including home health agencies. By statute, states are required to enter into contracts with RACs to audit payments to Medicaid providers although states are allowed to request waivers of aspects of this requirement. Further, under the Medicaid Integrity Program, CMS employs private contractors, referred to as Medicaid Integrity Contractors, to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. CMS is transitioning some of its other integrity programs to a consolidated model by engaging Unified Program Integrity Contractors (“UPICs”) to perform audits, investigations and other integrity activities.
 From time to time, various federal and state agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), issue pronouncements that identify practices that may be subject to heightened scrutiny, as well as practices that may violate fraud and abuse laws. For example, the Office of the Inspector General issued an Investigative Advisory in 2012 that identified a number of program integrity vulnerabilities in the delivery of personal care services and recommending corrective actions by CMS. In December 2016, CMS issued a bulletin highlighting safeguards that state Medicaid agencies can put in place around personal care services. It has also issued guidance to personal care services agencies and attendants on avoiding improper payments. We believe, but cannot assure you, that our operations comply with the principles expressed by HHS in these reports, advisories and guidance.
 HIPAA and Other Privacy and Security Requirements
 The HIPAA Administrative Simplification provisions and implementing regulations require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards and code sets for certain healthcare claims and reimbursement payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the U.S. healthcare industry.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations extensively regulate the use, disclosure, confidentiality, availability and integrity of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information,” and provide for a number of individual rights with respect to such information. These requirements apply to most healthcare providers, which are known as “covered entities,” including our company. Vendors, known as “business associates,” that handle protected health information, on behalf of covered entities must also comply with most HIPAA requirements. A covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity.
 Covered entities must, among other things, maintain privacy and security policies, train workforce members, maintain physical, administrative, and technical safeguards, enter into confidentiality agreements with business associates, and permit individuals to access and amend their protected health information. In addition, covered entities must report breaches of unsecured (unencrypted) protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 calendar days from the discovery date of the breach. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain cases involving large breaches, to the media.
 HIPAA violations may result in criminal penalties and significant civil penalties. Our company is also subject to other applicable federal or state laws that are more restrictive than HIPAA, which could result in additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions against entities whose inadequate data security programs may expose consumers to fraud, identity theft and privacy intrusions. Various state laws and regulations require entities that maintain individually identifiable information (even if not health-related) to report data breaches to affected individuals and, in some cases, state regulators. We expect compliance with HIPAA and other privacy and security standards to continue to impose significant costs on our business lines.

Environmental, Health and Safety Laws
 We are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the storage, transport, use and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. In the event of an accident involving such hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or at all.
