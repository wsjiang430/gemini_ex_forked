Item 1. Business
Organization
We were incorporated on December 19, 2013 as a Maryland corporation and elected to be taxed as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. Substantially all of our business is conducted through the OP.
We were formed to invest our assets in properties in the five boroughs of New York City, with a focus on Manhattan. We may also purchase certain real estate assets that accompany office properties, including retail spaces and amenities, as well as hospitality assets, residential assets and other property types exclusively in New York City. As of December 31, 2018, we owned seven properties consisting of 1,102,584 rentable square feet acquired for an aggregate purchase price of $702.0 million.
On April 24, 2014, we commenced our IPO on a “reasonable best efforts” basis of up to 30.0 million shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at a price of $25.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, for total gross proceeds of up to $750.0 million. We closed our IPO on May 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2018, we had 31.0 million shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares and shares issued pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”). In addition, from inception through December 31, 2018, we had raised net proceeds of $769.9 million, including $68.8 million of distributions to our shareholders which were reinvested in our common stock through DRIP.
We first established an estimated net asset value per share of our common stock (“Estimated Per-Share NAV”) in 2016. On October 24, 2016, our board of directors approved an Estimated Per-Share NAV of $21.25 as of June 30, 2016 (the “2016 Estimated Per-Share NAV”), which was published on October 26, 2016 (“NAV Pricing Date”). Prior to the NAV Pricing Date, we had offered shares pursuant to the DRIP and had repurchased shares pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program (the “SRP”) at a price based on $23.75 per share, the offering price in the IPO. Beginning with the NAV Pricing Date, we began to offer shares pursuant to the DRIP and repurchase shares pursuant to the SRP at a price based on Estimated Per-Share NAV. On October 23, 2018, our board of directors approved an Estimated Per-Share NAV equal to $20.26 as of June 30, 2018 (the “2018 Estimated Per-Share NAV”), which was published on October 25, 2018. Until we list shares of our common stock or another liquidity event occurs, we intend to publish subsequent valuations of Estimated Per-Share NAV at least once annually. We offer shares pursuant to the DRIP, which is not currently available as distributions are suspended and repurchase shares pursuant to the SRP which is, also, currently suspended, at a price based on Estimated Per-Share NAV. For additional information on the current status of the DRIP and the SRP, see Note 6 — Common Stock to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In March 2019, we changed our name from American Realty Capital New York City REIT, Inc. to New York City REIT, Inc.
We have no employees. Our Advisor manages our affairs on a day-to-day basis. We have retained New York City Properties, LLC (our “Property Manager”) to serve as our property manager. The Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global, and these related parties receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for services related to the investment and management of our assets. We are the sole general partner and hold substantially all of the units of limited partner interests in the OP (“OP Units”). The Advisor contributed $2,020 to the OP in exchange for 90 OP Units, which represents a nominal percentage of the aggregate OP ownership. A holder of OP Units has the right to convert OP Units for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock or, at the option of the OP, a corresponding number of shares of our common stock, in accordance with the limited partnership agreement of the OP, provided, however, that the OP Units must have been outstanding for at least one year. The remaining rights of the limited partners in the OP are limited, however, and do not include the ability to replace the general partner or to approve the sale, purchase or refinancing of the OP’s assets.

Investment Objectives: 
We are focused on helping our stockholders take advantage of the New York City real estate market. Our investment goals are as follows:

• | New York City Focus - Acquire high-quality commercial real estate located in the five boroughs of New York City, and in particular, Manhattan;


• | Cash Flow Generating Properties - Invest primarily in properties with 80% or greater occupancy at the time of purchase;


• | Potential for Appreciation - Purchase properties valued using current market rents with potential for appreciation and endeavor to acquire properties below replacement cost;


• | Low Leverage - Limit our borrowings to 40% - 50% of the aggregate fair market value of our assets;


• | Diversified Tenant Mix - Lease to a diversified group of tenants with a bias toward lease terms of five years or greater;


• | Pay Monthly Distributions - Pay monthly distributions. On February 27, 2018, we suspended distributions we pay to holders of our common stock and our board of directors will continue to evaluate our performance and assess our distribution policy; however, there can be no assurance as to when, or if, we will be able to resume paying distributions or the level at which we pay them; and


• | Maximize Total Returns - Maximize total returns to our stockholders through a combination of realized appreciation and current income.

Acquisition and Investment Policies
Primary Investment Focus
We have focused and intend to continue focusing our investment activities on acquiring quality, income-producing commercial real estate located in the five boroughs of New York City and, in particular, properties located in Manhattan. We may also originate or acquire real estate debt backed by quality, income-producing commercial real estate located predominantly in New York City. The real estate debt, which we may also originate or acquire is expected to be primarily first mortgage debt but also may include bridge loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity or securitized loans.
Investing in Real Property
We have invested and expect to invest a majority of our assets in office properties located in New York City. We may also invest in real estate assets that accompany office space, including retail spaces and amenities, as well as hospitality assets, residential assets and other property types exclusively in New York City.
Our Advisor considers relevant real estate and financial factors, including the location of the property, the leases and other agreements affecting the property, its income-producing capacity, its physical condition, its prospects for appreciation, its prospects for liquidity, tax considerations and other factors when evaluating prospective investments. In this regard, our Advisor has substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific investments, subject to board approval.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 there were no tenants whose annualized rental income on a straight-line basis, based on leases commenced, represented greater than 10% of total annualized rental income for all portfolio properties on a straight-line basis.
Real Estate-Related Loans and Debt Securities
Although not our primary focus, we may, from time to time, make investments in real estate-related loans and debt securities. These types of assets do not exceed 10.0% of our assets, or represent a substantial portion of our assets at any one time. The other real estate-related debt investments in which we may invest include: mortgages; mezzanine; bridge and other loans; debt and derivative securities related to real estate assets, including mortgage-backed securities; collateralized debt obligations; debt securities issued by real estate companies; and credit default swaps. Our criteria for investing in loans are substantially the same as those involved in our investment in properties; however, we will also evaluate such investments based on the current income opportunities presented.
Investing in Equity Securities
We may make equity investments in other REITs and other real estate companies that operate assets meeting our investment objectives. We may purchase the common or preferred stock of these entities or options to acquire their stock. We will target a public company that owns commercial real estate or real estate-related assets when we believe its stock is trading at a discount to that company’s net asset value. We may eventually seek to acquire or gain a controlling interest in the companies that we target. We do not expect our non-controlling equity investments in other public companies to represent a substantial portion of our assets at any one time. In addition, we do not expect our non-controlling equity investments in other public companies combined with 
2

our investments in real estate properties outside of our target investments and other real estate-related investments to exceed 10.0% of our portfolio.
Acquisition Structure
We have acquired real estate and real-estate related assets directly, for example, by acquiring fee interests in real property (a “fee interest” is the absolute, legal possession and ownership of land, property, or rights), or by purchasing interests, including controlling interests, in REITs or other “real estate operating companies,” such as real estate management companies and real estate development companies, that own real property. We also may acquire real estate assets through investments in joint venture entities, including joint venture entities in which we may not own a controlling interest, or assets under ground leases. Our assets generally are held in wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries of ours, each formed to hold a particular asset.
Financing Strategies and Offerings
We use debt financing to fund property improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other working capital needs. The form of our indebtedness varies and could be long-term or short-term, secured or unsecured, or fixed-rate or floating rate. We do not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements for speculative purposes but may do so in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risks on variable rate debt.
It is currently our intention to limit our aggregate borrowings to 40% – 50% of the aggregate fair market value of our assets. At the date of acquisition of each asset, we anticipate that the cost of investment for the asset will be substantially similar to its fair market value. However, subsequent events, including changes in the fair market value of our assets, could result in our exceeding our target leverage levels.
We will not borrow from our Advisor, any of our directors or any of our Advisor’s affiliates unless a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction approves the transaction as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable and no less favorable to us than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties.
We may reevaluate and change our financing policies without a stockholder vote. Factors that we would consider when reevaluating or changing our debt policy include then-current economic conditions, the relative cost and availability of debt and equity capital, our expected investment opportunities, the ability of our investments to generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service requirements and other similar factors.
Tax Status
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT we must, among other things, distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)) determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
Competition
The New York City real estate market is highly competitive. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property’s design to prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. In addition, the number of competing properties in the New York MSA could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties.
In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties and to acquire and to locate tenants and purchasers for our properties. These competitors include other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, private investment funds, institutional investors, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. We also may compete with other entities advised or sponsored by affiliates of AR Global for properties or tenants. In addition, these same entities seek financing through similar channels. Therefore, we compete for financing in a market where funds for real estate financing may decrease.
Competition from these and other third party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available. It also may result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our potential borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms. In addition, the number of competing properties in the New York MSA could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties.

 Regulations
 Our investments are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments.
Environmental
 As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future. We hire third parties to conduct Phase I environmental reviews of the real property that we intend to purchase.
We did not make any material capital expenditures in connection with environmental, health and safety laws, ordinances and regulations in 2018 and do not expect that we will be required to make any such material capital expenditures during 2019.
Employees
 We have no employees. The employees of our Advisor and its affiliates perform a full range of real estate services for us, including acquisitions, property management, accounting, legal, asset management and investor relations services.
 We are dependent on these entities for services that are essential to us, including capital markets activities, asset acquisition decisions, property management and other general administrative responsibilities. In the event that any of these companies were unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to provide such services ourselves or obtain such services from other sources.
