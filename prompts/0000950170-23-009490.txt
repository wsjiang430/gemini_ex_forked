Item 1. Business.
 Overview

We are a microbiome technology company with a portfolio of intellectual property and microbiome assets. Our objectives are to realize the value of our intellectual property estate through licensing our technology to collaboration partners and enforcing our patent rights against infringing parties and, in certain cases, to generate additional data on selected product candidates through academic collaborations. We have a robust intellectual property estate reflecting our pioneering role in the microbiome therapeutics field, including more than 70 issued U.S. and foreign patents with relevance for both donor-derived and donor-independent microbiome therapeutics in a range of potential indications. Our assets include CP101, an investigational, orally administered microbiome candidate designed for the prevention of recurrent C. difficile infection, or CDI, with positive clinical data from a Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trial and a Phase 2 open-label trial, and

pre-clinical assets that are designed to target ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and autism spectrum disorder. Additionally, we have developed a significant biorepository of strains and samples. In January 2023, we announced the decision to discontinue our Phase 3 clinical trial of CP101 in recurrent CDI and focus on realizing the value of our intellectual property estate and other assets. We are currently in the process of winding down our development efforts and significantly scaling back our expenses, including by terminating vendor contracts and reducing headcount.
 
Until January 2023, we were a clinical-stage microbiome therapeutics company using our Human-First Discovery platform to develop a novel class of orally administered biological drugs. The microbiome consists of trillions of microbes that live symbiotically in and on every human and are essential to our health. When key microbes are lost, the resulting microbiome disruption can increase susceptibility to immune disorders, infections, neurological conditions, cancer and other serious diseases. We developed our Human-First Discovery platform to use reverse translation to identify diseases of microbiome disruption and to design microbiome therapeutics that address them.

We were previously developing CP101 as an orally administered complete microbiome therapeutic designed for the prevention of recurrent CDI. In June 2020, we reported positive topline data from our Phase 2 placebo-controlled clinical trial of CP101 for the prevention of recurrent CDI, and in November 2021 we reported positive topline data from our open-label, Phase 2 clinical trial of CP101 for the prevention of recurrent CDI.  On March 1, 2022, we announced that enrollment in our Phase 3 clinical trial of CP101 for the prevention of recurrent CDI, or the PRISM4 trial, was paused following receipt of a clinical hold letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in connection with our investigational new drug application for CP101, requesting additional information regarding our SARS-CoV-2 donor screening procedures and associated informed consent language. On April 27, 2022, the FDA removed the clinical hold and in October 2022, we proceeded with patient dosing in the PRISM4 trial. On January 24, 2023, we announced our decision to discontinue PRISM4. We believe that CP101 has therapeutic potential in both CDI and other indications.
 
We have also used our Human-First Discovery platform to develop FIN-211, an investigational microbiome candidate designed to address the gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, or ASD. Following a strategic review of our pipeline, on November 10, 2022, we announced the decision to suspend efforts to initiate our planned Phase 1 clinical trial of FIN-211 in ASD, or the AUSPIRE trial.

In January 2017, we entered into an agreement, which we refer to as the Takeda Agreement, with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, pursuant to which we granted Takeda a worldwide, exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain of our patents, patent applications and know-how to develop our microbiome therapeutic candidate, FIN-524, for the prevention, diagnosis, theragnosis or treatment of diseases in humans. We also partnered with Takeda on discovery efforts targeting the development of the microbiome therapeutic candidate FIN-525 for the treatment of Crohn’s disease. In August 2022, Takeda elected to terminate the Takeda Agreement. Termination of the Takeda Agreement became effective on November 17, 2022, at which point the license rights granted to Takeda terminated and we regained full rights to pursue FIN-524 and FIN-525, and any other microbiome product candidates for inflammatory bowel disease, in all fields worldwide.

We will also continue to explore opportunities to realize the value of our intellectual property and microbiome assets through strategic partnerships and academic collaborations. These include our licensing relationship with the University of Minnesota, or UMN, pursuant to which UMN is conducting multiple investigator-sponsored clinical trials using a microbiome product candidate comprised of compositions to which we hold an exclusive license. In addition to our clinical and pre-clinical assets, we have developed a biorepository of samples and strains that can be used in a variety of research applications and may form the basis for future collaborations.

On each of April 19, 2022, September 1, 2022, and January 24, 2023, we announced the implementation of certain expense reduction measures, including reductions in our workforce. On January 24, 2023, we announced a decision to re-orient our business strategy to close our Phase 3 study of CP101 in CDI and focus on realizing the value of the Company’s intellectual property and other assets. This decision came after an assessment by our management team and board of directors of multiple factors, including our outlook for identifying a commercial partner, slower than anticipated enrollment in the PRISM4 trial, the harmful impact of what we believe is the ongoing unauthorized use of our intellectual property, and broader sector trends in the biotechnology industry.
 
Targeted and Enriched Consortia Product Candidates
 
In addition to CP101, a Complete Consortia product candidate designed to address community-level dysbiosis, or disruption across many functional pathways and species, we also developed certain Targeted Consortia product candidates that consist of individual bacteria grown from master cell banks to engage narrower pathway-level dysbiosis. The ability to pursue both

of these product strategies enabled us to tailor our product candidates to the pathophysiology of each indication. This combination of capabilities also enabled us to pursue a third product strategy, Enriched Consortia, which is designed to address dysbiosis at both the community and pathway level. These product strategies are summarized in the schema below:






The Human Microbiome and its Impact on Disease

The human microbiome describes the community of more than 30 trillion microbes that reside on and inside the human body. By evolving together over millions of years, microbes and humans have developed an intricate and mutually beneficial relationship that has only recently been uncovered. Enabled by the genomic revolution, researchers have discovered that humans carry over 1,000-fold more microbial genes than host genes and that microbiome signaling is fundamentally intertwined with many aspects of human physiology ranging from immune and metabolic functions to neurological function and reproductive health. The deep inter-relationship between microbes and their human hosts is a co-evolution that has resulted in a learned dependency, leaving humans now reliant on inputs from this previously unrecognized organ system.

Disruption of the gut microbiome is associated with a large number of diseases that have dramatically increased in prevalence among populations in developed countries over the past century. We believe these epidemiological trends are linked to changes in the microbiome, which if reversed could potentially address an underlying cause of these diseases and change the epidemiology as a result. The rise of these chronic illnesses coincides with our adoption of a number of practices that disrupt the microbiome: as of 2015, more than 42 billion doses of antibiotics are administered annually, many killing 40-60% of microbial species in the gut; a third of babies in the United States today are born by caesarean sections, and are consequently unable to inherit this organ from their mother; and a highly sanitized and artificial environment, absent the environmental inputs expected by our microbiome, applies further pressure on this ecosystem within us. The effects of these environmental inputs coalesce around the gut microbiome resulting in dysbiosis and these changes are linked to a wide variety of chronic diseases. For example, antibiotic exposure doubles the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, as well as significantly increases the risk of developing over 10 types of cancer. Early microbiome disruption is also associated with ASD, autoimmune indications such as celiac diseases, and allergies and asthma, and microbiome disruption later in life has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Importantly, in multiple animal models, these diseases can be induced by microbiome disruption and corrected by restoration, providing evidence of causality. For several of these therapeutic areas, this has been further bolstered by clinical data with FMT.

The effects of gut microbiome dysbiosis reverberates throughout the body, both because immune cells are heavily concentrated in the gut, where more than 70% of the body’s immune cells are located, and because microbial metabolites enter systemic circulation, acting on organs throughout the body. For example, researchers at the California Institute of Technology showed that the transfer of the microbiome from human donors with ASD into microbiome-free mice promoted hallmark autistic behaviors. In addition, a large body of research has documented the connection between over a dozen different microbiome species and molecular pathways connecting the gut’s enteric nervous system to the brain. We believe the gut-brain axis is but one example of how the microbiome can provide therapeutic benefits to diseases beyond the gut.

Restoring the microbiome, or its inputs, is an opportunity to directly address the underlying causes of many diseases driven by disruption of the microbiome. Many existing drugs target only the downstream symptoms of disease, for example, anti-tumor necrosis factor, or anti-TNF, biologics are prescribed to IBD patients to suppress systemic immunity, without addressing the underlying drivers of gut inflammation and immune dysregulation. This can lead to unintended side effects as well as an incomplete resolution of disease. Treating the root cause of disease is more likely to deliver a therapeutic breakthrough and for many diseases of microbiome disruption, we believe that only through the restoration of the critical physiological role of the microbiome organ can this be achieved.
Intellectual Property

As a core source of value at the Company, we believe that our intellectual property portfolio is foundational for the field of microbiome therapeutics. We believe that this portfolio may present attractive licensing opportunities as the field continues to mature and new applications for microbiome technology emerge. We have filed or in-licensed U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to this foundational technology. As a result, we have developed a significant portfolio of intellectual property assets.

The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent may be challenged in courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or at all, whether the claims of any patent applications, should they issue, will cover relevant product candidates, or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide any competitive advantage or value for the enterprise.


Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months following their submission, or potentially even longer, and because publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries and patent application filings, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Accordingly, others may contend that we may not have been the first to invent the subject matter disclosed in some of our patent applications or the first to file patent applications covering such subject matter.

We have a large and diverse patent portfolio consisting of more than 70 issued U.S. and foreign patents that we own or exclusively license from others. Our patent portfolio has broad applicability of specific inventions across the microbiome field, and provides protection for our product candidates CP101, FIN-211, FIN-524, FIN-525, as well as additional Complete, Enriched and Targeted Consortia product candidates that may be developed. For CP101 specifically, our patent portfolio includes more than ten U.S. patents that cover CP101 and specific methods of use and manufacture. These patents have expiration dates between 2031 and 2037.
Foundational Protection for Multiple Product Candidates

Many of our patents and patent applications originate from patent families that embody pioneering work in the microbiome by Dr. Thomas Borody, a prolific inventor and founder of the Centre for Digestive Diseases in Australia, and Drs. Alexander Khoruts and Michael Sadowsky at the University of Minnesota. These patent families have priority dates that precede the entry into the microbiome field by many of our competitors. As a result, we have been successful in obtaining broad patent coverage from these patent families over the composition formulation, method of manufacture and method of using our product candidates. These patent families include:
•We own a patent family that includes over twenty issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, granted foreign patents in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, Mexico, Republic of Korea, New Zealand and Japan, and two pending foreign patent applications. Representative issued U.S. patents in this family include U.S. 10,022,406, U.S. 9,962,413, U.S. 10,328,107, U.S. 10,278,997, and U.S. 10,617,724, that have claims directed to specific approaches to pharmaceutical compositions comprising stool bacterial material and a cryoprotectant, methods of processing stool received from healthy human donors, methods of manufacturing, and formulations. Patent applications, if issued, and patents in this family are expected to expire in 2031, assuming all required maintenance fees are paid and absent any applicable patent term extension or patent term adjustment. 
 •We exclusively in-license a patent family from the Regents of the University of Minnesota that includes over five issued U.S. patents, three pending U.S. patent applications, granted foreign patents in Australia, Europe, Canada and China, and three pending foreign patent applications. Representative issued U.S. patents within this family include U.S. 10,028,980, U.S. 10,286,011, U.S. 10,286,012, and U.S. 10,251,914, that have claims directed to specific approaches to formulations comprising fecal bacteria, methods of increasing fecal microbiota diversity, and methods of decreasing the relative abundance of a bacteria. Patent applications, if issued, and patents in this family are expected to expire in 2032, assuming all required maintenance fees are paid and absent any applicable patent term extension or patent term adjustment. 
 •We own a patent family that includes three issued U.S. patents U.S. 9,901,603, U.S. 10,821,138 and U.S. 11,123,377, one pending U.S. patent application, granted patents in Australia, Brazil, Japan and China, and eight pending foreign patent applications. These issued U.S. patents have claims directed to specific approaches to room temperature stable products containing human-derived bacteria. Patent applications, if issued, and patents in this family are expected to expire in 2036, assuming all required maintenance fees are paid and absent any applicable patent term extension or patent term adjustment. 
 Complete Consortia Product Candidates, including CP101

Our patent portfolio provides comprehensive patent protection for our Complete Consortia product candidates, including CP101. Representative patents and patent applications from our foundational patent families that have claims that cover CP101 and other Complete Consortia product candidates include:

•One owned issued U.S. patent (U.S. 10,617,724) covering specific approaches to capsules containing lyophilized fecal microbiota from healthy donors, expected to expire in 2031. 
 •Three owned issued U.S. patents (U.S. 9,962,413, U.S. 10,328,107, and 10,849,937) covering specific approaches to the collection and processing of stool from healthy donors, expected to expire in 2031. 
 •One owned issued U.S. patent (U.S. 10,022,406) covering specific approaches to compositions comprising fecal microbiota derived from healthy donors, expected to expire in 2031. 
 •Four in-licensed issued U.S. patents (U.S. 10,028,980, U.S. 10,286,011, U.S. 10,286,012, and U.S. 10,251,914) covering specific approaches to formulations of fecal microbiota derived from healthy donors and their use, expected to expire in 2032. 
 •Two owned issued U.S. patents (U.S. 9,901,603 and U.S. 10,821,138) covering specific approaches to room-temperature stable products containing human-derived bacteria. 
 •One in-licensed issued U.S. patent (U.S. 10,849,936) covering specific approaches to a method of treating C. difficile infection using lyophilized fecal microbiota, expected to expire in 2037. 
 Targeted Consortia Product Candidates

For our Targeted Consortia product candidates and their manufacture, our portfolio consists of several issued U.S. patents from our foundational patent families that provide patent coverage. We are also pursuing patent protection that we expect will cover each of our Targeted Consortia product candidates, including FIN-524. Representative patents that we own and provide protection for our Targeted Consortia product candidates include issued U.S. patents (U.S. 10,610,551 and U.S. 10,278,997) covering specific approaches to compositions having lyophilized bacteria from the genus Bacteroides or the phylum Firmicutes derived from healthy donors and their manufacture, which are expected to expire in 2031.
Enriched Consortia Product Candidates

Our Enriched Consortia product candidates, such as FIN-211, are protected by many of the same patents and patent applications that cover our Complete Consortia product candidates. We also have patent protection for these Enriched Consortia product candidates specifically as well as various pending applications that we expect will cover these product candidates. Representative patents and patent applications that have claims that cover our Enriched Consortia product candidates include:
•One owned issued U.S. patent (U.S. 11,207,356) covering specific approaches to encapsulated compositions containing donor-derived microbiota enriched with one or more cultured bacterial strains, expected to expire in 2031.
 •One in-licensed issued U.S. patent (U.S. 11,202,808) covering specific approaches to methods of treating ASD or an associated gastrointestinal symptom by orally administering a donor-derived microbial community and a bacterial isolate from a genus with potential therapeutic applications in ASD, expected to expire in 2037. 
 •One owned issued U.S. patent (U.S. 10,022,406) covering specific approaches to compositions comprising fecal microbiota derived from healthy donors, expected to expire in 2031. 
 •Three owned issued U.S. patents (U.S. 9,962,413, U.S. 10,328,107, and 10,849,937) covering specific approaches to the collection and processing of stool from healthy donors, expected to expire in 2031. 
 •Two owned issued U.S. patents (U.S. 9,901,603 and U.S. 10,821,138) covering specific approaches to room temperature stable formulations containing human-derived bacteria, expected to expire in 2036. 
 •One in-licensed issued U.S. patent (U.S. 10,286,012) covering specific approaches to the use of formulations of fecal microbiota derived from healthy donors, expected to expire in 2032. 
 Patent Term

Generally, issued patents are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional filing date. In certain instances, patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of delay by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in examining the patent application (patent term adjustment) or extended to account for term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period (patent term extension), or both. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent may be shortened by terminal disclaimer, which reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.


Patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 is available for one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of a first approved FDA drug product, or its methods of use or manufacture. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or fourteen years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug product, and a patent cannot be extended more than once or for more than a single product. During the period of extension, if granted, the scope of exclusivity is limited to the approved product for approved uses. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. If and when product candidates developed using our intellectual property receive FDA approval, we expect to apply, if appropriate, for patent term extension on patents covering those product candidates, their methods of use and/or methods of manufacture.
 Trade Secrets

In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entities’ relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
Our Collaborations and License Agreements
Exclusive License Agreement with Arizona State University

In July 2017, we entered into a license agreement, or the Arizona State Agreement, with Skysong Innovations LLC (formerly Arizona Science and Technology Enterprises LLC), or Skysong, pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, royalty-bearing, exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain patents and patent applications of Arizona State University to make, have made, use, have used, sell, have sold, offer to sell, have offered for sale, import, have imported, export or have exported products and services that are covered by such licensed patents. In July 2018, we subsequently amended the Arizona State Agreement to include certain additional patents and patent applications of Arizona State University. The patents and patent applications that we have exclusively licensed from Arizona State University under the Arizona State Agreement relate generally to compositions and methods to treat autism spectrum disorder and related symptoms and comorbidities. If issued, the patents within the licensed intellectual property would be expected to expire beginning in 2033.

Pursuant to the terms of the Arizona State Agreement, we, our affiliates or our sublicensees, are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts in connection with the development and commercialization of products and services, the manufacture, use, sale, offering for sale, importation or exportation of which, but for the license granted under the Arizona State Agreement, would infringe one or more licensed patents, or licensed products. Such efforts are limited to the United States and include a specific performance milestone. We are also currently engaging in discussions with Skysong regarding our recent strategic reprioritization and the potential implications of these changes on our ongoing obligations under the Arizona State Agreement.
 
Under the terms of the Arizona State Agreement, we paid Skysong an upfront fee of $10,000 and reimbursed Skysong for prior patent prosecution expenses. Additionally, we have agreed to make a low-six digits milestone payment upon the first commercial sale of a product in each of the United States, England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan, and a one-time commercial milestone payment in the low-seven digits upon the achievement of cumulative, worldwide net sales of all licensed products by us, our sublicensees or respective affiliates in the low-nine digits. We are also obligated to pay Skysong a low-single digit royalty on net sales of licensed products, including a minimum annual royalty payment in the mid-four digits to low-five digits that is creditable against the royalties due in such year. The royalty obligations continue on a country-by-country basis as to each licensed product until expiry of the last to expire claim within the licensed patents that covers

such licensed product in such country. Moreover, we are obligated to pay a percentage of any non-royalty consideration received by us from a sublicensee in the high-second decile.

The Arizona State Agreement expires on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations. Upon expiration of our royalty obligations with respect to a licensed product in a country we will have a royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual license to such licensed product in such country. We may terminate the Arizona State Agreement for any reason or upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by Skysong. Skysong may terminate the Arizona State Agreement upon our uncured material breach of the agreement, our insolvency, our initiation of any proceeding or claim challenging the validity or enforceability of any licensed patent, or our failure to meet a specific performance milestone.
Exclusive Patent License Agreement with the University of Minnesota

In March 2012, CIPAC Limited, an entity established under the laws of Malta, or CIPAC, entered into a license agreement, or the UMN Agreement, with Regents of UMN, pursuant to which CIPAC obtained a worldwide, royalty-bearing, exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain patents and inventions of the University of Minnesota to make, have made, use, offer to sell or sell, offer to lease or lease, import, or otherwise offer to dispose or dispose of any product or service that is covered by such licensed patents. The UMN Agreement was subsequently amended in June 2014 and October 2014. In May 2015, CIPAC transferred its interest in the UMN Agreement to us. Subsequent to such transfer, the UMN Agreement was subsequently amended in December 2016 and September 2017. We amended and restated the UMN Agreement in January 2022, to consolidate earlier amendments and extend the deadline for satisfying performance milestones by one year.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the UMN Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed inventions and to manufacture and sell licensed products, including by meeting certain specific performance milestones. We are currently in discussions with UMN to amend the UMN Agreement with respect to the dates of specific deadlines for achieving milestones required as part of our obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed inventions and to manufacture and sell licensed products, but we cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful.
 
Under the terms of the UMN Agreement, we paid UMN an aggregate upfront fee of $155,000, and are obligated to pay annual maintenance fees in the mid-four digits. We are also obligated to pay UMN a royalty on net sales of licensed products ranging in the low-single digits depending on which licensed patents cover such licensed product, subject to a minimum annual royalty payment escalating over time in the low-five digits to low-six digits payable at the end of each applicable year. Such minimum annual royalty payments began in 2021. The royalty obligations continue on a country-by-country basis as to each licensed product until expiry of the last to expire claim within the licensed patents that cover such licensed product in such country. Moreover, we are obligated to pay a percentage of any non-royalty consideration received by us from a sublicensee in the high-second decile.

The UMN Agreement expires on the date of expiration of all claims under the licensed patents. We may terminate the UMN Agreement upon an uncured material breach of the UMN Agreement by UMN. UMN may terminate the UMN Agreement upon our uncured material breach of the agreement, our insolvency, or upon the commencement by us of any proceeding asserting or alleging the invalidity or unenforceability of the licensed patents.
Agreements with OpenBiome
Asset Purchase Agreement

In November 2020, we entered into an asset purchase agreement, or the OpenBiome Agreement, with Microbiome Health Research Institute, Inc., or OpenBiome, pursuant to which we acquired certain biological samples, including aliquots of human stool that have been used in clinical trials and under enforcement discretion for the treatment of CDI not responding to standard therapy, and obtained a perpetual license to certain OpenBiome technology, and, upon closing of the transaction, we acquired certain additional assets of OpenBiome, including capital equipment (comprising lab equipment) and contracts relating to the operating maintenance of a lab facility. In connection with entering into the OpenBiome Agreement, we terminated our other existing agreements with OpenBiome, as such agreements were superseded by the OpenBiome Agreement and certain other agreements entered into concurrently with the OpenBiome Agreement.

In connection with the signing of the OpenBiome Agreement, OpenBiome granted us a worldwide, irrevocable and perpetual license, with the right to grant sublicenses (through multiple tiers) under certain of OpenBiome’s technology that is necessary

or useful in the manufacture of products manufactured directly from stool from a stool donor source without the use of culturing or replication, which we refer to as Natural Products, including technology pertaining to the selection of human stool donors, the collection and processing of stool from human donors and the preparation of stool-based products, and under any improvements to our intellectual property previously developed by OpenBiome or developed by OpenBiome during a specified period of time after the closing of the transaction, in each case to exploit products and services. In addition to the foregoing license, except under certain limited circumstances, OpenBiome agreed not to license or transfer to our competitors any rights to those aspects of its manufacturing technology that are not publicly available as of the date of the OpenBiome Agreement.

Pursuant to the OpenBiome Agreement, for the period prior to the closing of the transaction we granted OpenBiome a worldwide, non-exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and export certain Natural Products solely for the treatment of recurrent CDI in the United States under an FDA policy of enforcement discretion and to conduct clinical research in all fields other than the diagnosis, treatment, palliation or prevention in humans of CDI not subject to an FDA policy of enforcement discretion, IBD, ASD or hepatitis B virus, or HBV. Additionally, for the period beginning on the closing of the transaction, we granted OpenBiome a worldwide, non-exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to sell certain Natural Products manufactured prior to the closing of the transaction solely for the treatment of recurrent CDI in the United States under enforcement discretion, and to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and export certain Natural Products for purposes of conducting clinical research in all fields other than the diagnosis, treatment, palliation or prevention in humans of CDI not subject to an FDA policy of enforcement discretion, IBD, ASD or HBV. Notwithstanding the foregoing license, OpenBiome has agreed to certain restrictions related to the use, sale and supply of such products in connection with clinical research of our competitors. Additionally, the license grant excludes any license to exploit a Natural Product wherein processed stool is lyophilized (such as in the case of CP101).

In connection with the signing of the OpenBiome Agreement, we paid OpenBiome $1.0 million in the form of an upfront payment and $150,000 as reimbursement for OpenBiome’s attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection the negotiation of the OpenBiome Agreement. On the closing of the transaction, we paid OpenBiome $2.25 million, plus an additional $1.6 million if no regulatory restrictions were in place preventing the sale and distribution of OpenBiome’s products under enforcement discretion as of the date of closing. In addition to the foregoing payments, we are obligated to pay to OpenBiome a low single digit royalty on net sales of Natural Products by us and our affiliates and a high single digit royalty of certain sublicensing revenue (including royalties) received in connection with Natural Products, as well as a low single digit royalty on net sales of FIN-524, FIN-525 and any product that is not a Natural Product or a product that comprises both material manufactured directly from stool from a stool donor source without the use of culturing or replication and drug substance or drug product comprising one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients, and, in either case contains one or more isolates derived from certain stool donors that are exclusive to us, or Cultured Products, by us and our affiliates and a high single digit percentage of certain sublicensing revenue (including royalties) received in connection with Cultured Products. On a country-by-country basis, our payment obligations with respect to Natural Products expires twenty-five years after first commercial sale of such Natural Product in such country, and, with respect to Cultured Products expires fifteen years after first commercial sale of such Cultured Product in such country. We are also obligated to pay OpenBiome up to $6.0 million in the aggregate upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones with Natural Products and $20.0 million in the aggregate upon achievement of certain commercial milestones with Natural Products.
LMIC License Agreement

In November 2020, concurrently with entering into the OpenBiome Agreement, we entered into a license agreement, or the LMIC Agreement, with OpenBiome, pursuant to which we granted OpenBiome a non-exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain of our patents, patent applications and know-how that are reasonably necessary or useful for the exploitation of products manufactured directly from stool from a stool donor source without the use of culturing or replication, or Natural Products, to make, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale and import Natural Products and formulated liquid suspensions derived from the stool of a stool donor source that may be incorporated into a Natural Product, in either case for the treatment in humans of malnutrition and neglected tropical diseases in certain low- and middle-income countries, or the LMIC Territory. The license grant excludes any license to exploit a Natural Product wherein processed stool is lyophilized (such as in the case of CP101) or to otherwise use the licensed intellectual property to lyophilize a product.

Pursuant to the LMIC Agreement, we own all improvements, enhancements or modifications to the licensed intellectual property (whether or not patentable) invented by either party during the term of the LMIC Agreement. OpenBiome has agreed to assign to us its interest in and to any such improvements, enhancements or modifications.
 

Pursuant to the LMIC Agreement, we are entitled to receive tiered royalties on net sales of Natural Products and products that incorporate formulated liquid suspensions derived from the stool of a stool donor source that may be incorporated into a Natural Product in the LMIC Territory ranging from mid-single digit to low-second decile. Royalties are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis during the period beginning on the first commercial sale of such product in such country and ending on the later of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim from a licensed patent that covers such product or ten years from the date of the LMIC Agreement.

The LMIC Agreement expires on product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon expiry of the applicable royalty obligation for such product in such country. OpenBiome has the right to terminate the LMIC Agreement upon specified prior written notice to us. Either party may terminate the LMIC Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party of either the LMIC Agreement (or uncured breach by OpenBiome of the OpenBiome Agreement), provided that if such uncured material breach is limited to a breach of the LMIC Agreement in a particular country, our right to terminate the LMIC Agreement is limited to just such country. Either party may terminate the LMIC Agreement in the event of the insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the LMIC Agreement in the event that OpenBiome brings, or assists in bringing, a challenge to the validity, patentability, scope, construction, inventorship, ownership, enforceability or non-infringement of any licensed patent or patent application.
Government Regulation

Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological products, such as our product candidates. Although we have discontinued the PRISM4 trial and withdrawn our investigational new drug application, or IND, for CP101, as the sponsor of clinical trials and IND holder, we along with third-party contractors, remain subject to regulation. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process or post-approval may subject an applicant to delays in development or approval or licensure, as well as administrative or judicial sanctions.
Regulatory Approval of Biological Products in the United States

In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Biological products are also subject to other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations.
Preclinical Studies

Before testing any biological product candidates in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product biological characteristics, chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including the Good Laboratory Practice regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA by a sponsor to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
Clinical Trials

The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and eligibility criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated in the trial. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board, or IRB, for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.


There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about certain clinical trials, including clinical trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. Information related to the investigational product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Disclosure of the results of these clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances.

A sponsor who wishes to discontinue a clinical investigation under an IND must notify FDA and IRBs of the discontinuance. A sponsor may request that FDA inactivate or terminate its IND. If an IND is placed on inactive status, all investigators shall be so notified and all stocks of the drug shall be returned or otherwise disposed of in accordance with FDA regulations. A sponsor is not required to submit annual reports to an IND on inactive status. A sponsor who intends to resume clinical investigation under an IND placed on inactive status must submit a protocol amendment to FDA containing the proposed general investigational plan for the coming year and appropriate protocols. Clinical investigations under an IND on inactive status may only resume (1) 30 days after FDA receives the protocol amendment, unless FDA notifies the sponsor that the investigations described in the amendment are subject to a clinical hold, or (2) on earlier notification by FDA that the clinical investigations described in the protocol amendment may begin.
 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within fifteen calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
International Regulation

In addition to regulations in the United States and Europe, a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of product candidates.
