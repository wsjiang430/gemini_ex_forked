 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
We are a leading technology provider of global policy and market intelligence. We deliver critical, actionable legal and policy insights in a rapidly evolving political, regulatory and macroeconomic environment. By combining artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies with analytics, workflow tools, and expert peer insights, we empower customers to manage policy change, address regulatory developments, and mitigate global risk. We ingest unstructured legislative and regulatory data, and employ AI and data science to deliver structured, relevant and actionable information in order to facilitate key operational and strategic decisions by global enterprises, midsized and smaller businesses, government institutions, trade groups, and nonprofits. We deliver that intelligence through our suite of public policy and issues management products, including the FiscalNote core product, CQ Federal, EU Issue Tracker and Curate. Our products incorporate workflow tools that enable our clients to monitor, manage, collaborate and efficiently organize for action on the issues that matter most to them, integrating global policy and market intelligence seamlessly into their daily activities. In addition, we offer our customers expert and customized analysis through our geopolitical and market intelligence businesses, including FrontierView, a market intelligence advisory firm for global business professionals, Oxford Analytica, which provides strategic geopolitical intelligence analysis of world events and Dragonfly Eye, a geopolitical and security intelligence service. The FiscalNote portfolio also includes advocacy and constituent management services that connect citizens with their government representatives and vice versa, as well as peer-to-peer community insights, ESG and AI products and services.

We serve a global, diverse customer base that includes businesses (including over half of the Fortune 100), government agencies, law firms, professional services organizations, trade groups and non-profits in over 45 countries. We generated total revenues of $113.8 million and $82.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We generate recurring revenues through our subscription-based model, which accounts for approximately 90% of our total revenues. We believe that the compelling value proposition of the insights delivered by our platform, combined with the expert analysis, workflow tools and other products and services we offer, has driven substantial customer loyalty.

Our History

Our co-founders established FiscalNote in 2013 with a vision of using technology, including AI, machine learning and natural language processing, to bring clarity to the disparate unstructured and rapidly changing data on governmental activities and empower organizations to better understand and act on the issues that matter to them. Today, we remain committed to the principle of leveraging technology to provide transparency into the policy, people, and politics shaping the world.

Over the last several years, we have closed a number of strategic acquisitions to increase our scale and enhance our portfolio of products and services with complementary offerings.
•In July 2017, we completed the acquisition of VoterVoice LLC (“VoterVoice”), a Baton Rouge, Louisiana-based digital advocacy solutions business founded in 2000. 
 •In January 2018, we acquired Shungham Information SPRL (“Shungham”), whose EU Issue Tracker product, provides European Union regulatory and legislative intelligence. Shungham was originally founded in 2010 and is based in Brussels, Belgium. 
 •We acquired CQ Roll Call, Inc. (“CQ Roll Call”) and Capitol Advantage LLC (“Capitol Advantage”) in August 2018, which significantly increased our scale and customer base. CQ and Roll Call, which were founded in 1945 and 1955, respectively, are two premier media brands reporting on the U.S. government, with established reputations for non-partisan journalism. Capitol Advantage is the largest publisher of congressional directories in the United States. 
 •In December 2020 and throughout 2021, we added ten complementary or adjacent businesses to the FiscalNote family of brands, including the acquisitions in the geopolitical and market intelligence advisory business (Oxford Analytica and FrontierView). 


•Since completing the Transactions, FiscalNote has continued to execute on its acquisition strategy, acquiring Aicel Technologies, an alternative data business based in Korea, the assets of DT Global, a market intelligence company focused on central and eastern Europe and the Middle East, and Dragonfly Intelligence, a geopolitical and security intelligence service based in the United Kingdom (U.K.) acquired in 2023.
 
Our acquisitions since December 2020 have introduced us to new geographic territories in the U.K., Australia, Singapore and Austria, as well as increased our presence in Korea, the U.K. and within certain states in the United States. In addition to building out our portfolio with complimentary products and services and strategic technologies, these acquisitions have increased our employee headcount materially over time and, in certain cases, have enabled us to scale our customer base more rapidly. See Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Impacting the Comparability of Our Operating Results” for additional discussion.

We have grown, both organically and through acquisitions, into a global company with approximately 800 employees as of December 31, 2022. Our headquarters are located in Washington, D.C., and we maintain offices in Baton Rouge, LA, Austin, TX, Madison, WI, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Australia, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan.

Industry Trends

Expanding Core Market and New Adjacent Opportunities
In recent years, data analytics have moved from simply legal and regulatory information to a wider mix of content, software, and data for many industries. The availability of technology has accelerated the shift in focus from content creation and production to development of tools, data analysis, and unique insights. Digital and online native providers with predictive and prescriptive decision-making tools are expanding beyond legal and compliance. They benefit from increased demand from a range of other adjacent markets that generate significant volumes of data such as finance, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals. By supporting new use-cases, providers with advanced analytics products can capture a large share in a new, growing segment that is currently underserved.
Increasing Government Policy Uncertainty and Complexity Worldwide
As businesses and organizations expand their operations into more jurisdictions, they may become exposed to additional laws and regulations, which generally are growing in complexity. For example, a rideshare company operating in both the United States and Europe is subject to different sets of labor regulations. Within those individual countries, an organization must also comply with diverging laws in various states or other localities, as well as monitor policymaking that could result in new regulations. Changes in the laws and regulations applicable to the rideshare business could create risks or opportunities impacting our strategy, affect our financial results, or expose us to greater scrutiny or legal risk. Without a platform to efficiently manage and monitor legislation and regulations, businesses and organizations may become exposed to potential damage to their brands, reputations, or financial performance.
Organizations Struggle to Manage Information Throughout the Lifecycle of a Law or Regulation
Although legal and policy matters continue to grow in importance, we believe that existing platforms have failed to modernize their solutions to address the related needs of organizations of all sizes and sectors. We believe that current information and software providers are unable to support complex processes across multiple jurisdictions such as advocacy, constituent action, legislation, regulations, statutes, case law, and compliance. Legacy solutions also do little to structure the variable data and disparate information on legal and policy matters, making it difficult to search, identify patterns or derive insights from the abundance of information. In addition, they lack the technology and functionality required to navigate the complexity and nuances of cross-border laws and regulations. The growing volume of data makes it challenging for teams to not only quickly identify relevant policy and regulatory information that will impact their organizations, but also efficiently track, collaborate, assess, and report the critical risks and opportunities. Without an integrated platform, businesses and organizations are forced to engage with multiple different point solutions, which creates additional cost burdens and reduces productivity and efficiency.
Our Strategy

The proliferation of complex laws, regulations and policies is increasingly a source of risk and opportunity for all types of organizations - from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies to government agencies and non-profit, operating in virtually any sector of the economy. Accordingly, we believe that organizations increasingly require efficient and highly

automated solutions that aggregate, structure and provide actionable insights into the activities of disparate legislative, regulatory, and geopolitical actors, together with workflow tools that drive efficiency and automation in these areas, as well as insights provided by our expert advisory practices and peer-to-peer communities. We believe that we are a market leader for data-driven, actionable insights on legal, political, regulatory and policy matters, and our continued growth is expected to be driven by several strategic initiatives.

Our solution is centered on our suite of offerings and features that combine data, analytics, and workflows to drive actionable insights. Through our platforms and products, we deliver structured, relevant and actionable information to customers that enables them to achieve mission-critical results, such as securing government funding, generating incremental revenue, minimizing costs, and mitigating legal, regulatory, reputational or other risks.

Sales Optimization Strategy
We believe a significant opportunity exists for us to accelerate revenue growth by optimizing our sales organization and strategy. First, we intend to increase our sales productivity and efficiency and focus on larger enterprise and government accounts. We already enjoy a diverse “blue chip” client base across major public and private sectors, including over half of the Fortune 100. However, we believe there is significant room for growth in our base of larger enterprise and government accounts, and increasing our sales capacity will support pursuing those opportunities. In addition, after an initial sale to a new client, we have often successfully expanded the size and duration of the client engagement through cross-selling and upselling, as well as optimizing product pricing and packaging based on customer needs. Through this “land and expand” strategy, we have increased average account values year over year across government, enterprise, mid-market and small and medium-sized clients.
Research & Development
We continue to invest in improvements to our products and services to enhance the value of the data and insights they provide as well as improve our customer experience. Our efforts in this regard include expanding our data assets, developing new proprietary technology (including additional products and enhancements to existing products), building cross-product integrations where they compound the value of our portfolio of newly developed and acquired products, and offering additional human and machine-driven data augmentations and analytics that enhance existing products and services. We continue to advance our core infrastructure and processes for better scaling cross-product data integration, as well as easier deployment of data science and AI capabilities across products. We believe these investments will promote customer retention, facilitate cross-selling to existing customers and enable us to market to potential new customers.
Adjacent Market Opportunities
We intend to leverage our core technology and scalable platform to expand into adjacent markets. First, our platform can ingest and process a high volume of data sets, from activity at the hyper-local municipal level to international, to provide clients with greater functionality. In addition, insights generated through our technology can be packaged for various client use-cases, from traditional government affairs and advocacy activities to geopolitical risk research to corporate compliance with the growing body of ESG ratings and reporting regimes. We also believe there are significant opportunities to leverage our existing strengths in structuring data, providing actionable insights and workflow tools to develop vertically integrated solutions for regulated sectors of the future, including autonomous driving vehicles, cybersecurity, telehealth, the gig economy, crypto-currency, online sports betting, the cannabis industry and more. Finally, we continue to assess opportunities for international expansion, both to grow our customer footprint and expand our product offerings to provide insights into regulatory activities in additional jurisdictions.
Acquisition Opportunities
 The legal and policy information and technology industry is highly fragmented, and we believe we are well positioned to act as a consolidator in this area. We have a consistent track record of acquiring and successfully integrating complementary businesses that enhance our portfolio of products, services, and data sets. Since 2017, we completed 15 acquisitions, increasing our scale, adding expert analysis and advocacy tools to our portfolio of products and services, and enabling us to provide additional data sets and services for our customers. We plan to evaluate additional acquisition opportunities to supplement our existing platform, enter new markets and ensure we are well positioned to provide critical insights to the regulated sectors of the future. We intend to focus on acquisitions that leverage our core strengths and enhance our current product, market, geographic and customer strategies. We currently have a robust pipeline of potential opportunities in various stages of negotiation. At this time, we cannot estimate whether we will be successful in the

acquisition of these, or any other, companies. We believe the combination of our successful acquisition track record, scale and reputation uniquely position us to create value through additional acquisitions.

Our Competitive Strengths

Category Creator in a Large and Expanding Market Opportunity
As a technology company focused on global policy and market intelligence, we believe we are a category creator in a large and expanding market. Based on industry research, we believe the total addressable market for legal and regulatory information services was approximately $37 billion in 2021 according to Outsell and, due to several factors, will continue to expand in the coming years. First, organizations of all kinds - from business enterprises to government entities - are subject to proliferating regulations and policies of increasing complexity as well as geopolitical changes in the markets in which they operate. These organizations increasingly require a better understanding of the associated impacts on their operations. In addition, available data on legal and regulatory activities is disparate and unstructured, driving a need to aggregate and meaningfully standardize, analyze and curate that data into relevant insights that facilitate key operational and strategic decisions. Further, analytical capabilities in law are democratizing, as organizations increasingly rely on internal teams, tools and workflows to evaluate and take action on policy and regulatory risks. We believe we are well positioned to capture a significant portion of this growing opportunity due to our reputation, scalable platform and AI capabilities, strong management team and successful acquisition strategy.
Scalable Proprietary AI-Driven Technology
Our core technology is built upon our proprietary data collection, ingestion, processing, monitoring and refinement capabilities that serve certain of our different product and service offerings. We collect and process structured and unstructured data related to global legislative and regulatory activities from disparate sources, including expansive coverage of news, social, and world events. Throughout the pipelines we combine automated processes built using AI, supplemented with human-in-the-loop augmentation (i.e., human interaction in reviewing, validating, labeling or generating data as part of an automated processing pipeline to improve results and speed up the machine learning process) to derive structured metadata and generate trustworthy and actionable information at scale that powers multiple customer-facing applications. We believe our focus on configurable and maintainable ingestion and refinement technology can scale with the development and acquisition of new data sets and products, reducing our time to market and enabling us to differentiate ourselves from competitors and expand into adjacent markets and client verticals. From this information, our refinement and analysis capabilities deliver actionable insights for clients, including individualized alerts, activity-driven recommendations and event-based predictions. These insights are incorporated into workflow tools that support policy monitoring, automated reporting, stakeholder management and collaboration, revenue and funding generation, research and analytics, and streamlined compliance. We believe our proprietary technology delivers superior outcomes for our customers through a focus on combining deep product development expertise with subject matter expertise navigating technical complexities in the policy and legal domain. The value of our technology is highlighted by its ability to utilize machine learning to automatically learn and apply extractions, classifications, recommendations and connections between disparate data sources as more data is ingested, thereby providing increased customer value per dataset and data-driven insights over time.
Blue Chip Diverse Client Base
Our diverse customer base includes large multinational corporations as well as startups and other enterprises. We also support all three branches of the U.S. federal government, along with dozens of other national, state, and local government entities. In addition, we provide solutions to non-government organizations, nonprofits and advocacy groups. Thousands of enterprises, entities, and organizations rely on us to improve the way they build and manage their relationships with all levels of government, enabling them to have maximum impact on legislation and regulation. We believe our large enterprise and government clients offer significant opportunities for growth in the client engagement, while our diverse client base provides stability and mitigates risk to our business as a whole.
Multiple Growth Vectors
Our business benefits from a comprehensive platform that pairs organic and inorganic growth opportunities. By combining our existing solutions with complementary acquired assets, we continue to enhance the value proposition of our offerings to clients, grow our client engagements and expand our existing engagements through cross-sell and upsell successes. We embrace our “land and expand” strategy, which is supported by our simplified content and usage-based pricing model. In addition, we increase customer lifetime value through multi-year contract penetration, as well as

retention through our usage analytics and AI-powered technology. We aim to continue deploying our offerings across the globe and supporting more jurisdictions to accelerate and diversify our growth.

Prolific Acquisition Strategy and Proven Execution
Our consolidation strategy aims to enhance our existing businesses, expand our use cases, increase our market-leading position, and generate value for our shareholders. We focus on complementary assets with significant strategic and value accretion potential. Driven by our integration model, we benefit from increasing our user base via new customers, increased customer stickiness and sales volume via bundles, and unified data and analytics engines to deliver increasingly larger quantities of data with higher-quality information. We focus on opportunities with high market share and high subscription revenue streams, which drives back-office synergies. Our five largest acquisitions in 2021 yielded a weighted-average ARR growth of approximately 24% when comparing their acquisition date ARR with their ARR on December 31, 2022. In addition, we have deployed our AI-powered technology to reduce integration time and create significant cost savings for our acquisitions such as FactSquared and Oxford Analytica. We intend to continue pursue strategic acquisitions as we create a disruptive global data company in a new era of technology.
Founder-Led Management Team and Experienced Leadership
Our management team is led by Tim Hwang, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Director and Co-Founder, who brings to FiscalNote his vision, values, and commitment to our founding mission - to connect people and organizations to government through the use of technology and empower them to better understand and act on the issues that matter to them. Tim leads a talented management team with many years of collective experience and deep expertise in, among other matters, operating businesses at scale, executing a strategic acquisition and consolidation strategy, data science, corporate finance and capital allocation. Our high-profile Board of Directors brings decades of collective knowledge and expertise relevant to our industry, strategic plan, financial matters, legal compliance, governance and leadership.
Our Products and Services

Public Policy and Issues Management
Using AI and data analytics, our core platform provides policy monitoring capabilities at various jurisdictional levels both domestically and globally to enable clients to identify opportunity and manage risk associated with legislative and regulatory change. The robust platform reliably tracks U.S. Congressional and federal agency activity - from committee markups and amendments to introductions of proposed legislation to rulemaking and the regulatory comment process - as well as activities across state and local governments, further augmented by our Curate product, which we acquired in 2021. Additionally, customers are able to integrate custom policy, stakeholder, and other data and analysis surrounding the policy ecosystem into the platform to manage their policy, market, and stakeholder information in one place. Through our CQ product, we also offer deep and comprehensive news and analysis covering the politics, process, and impact of both lawmaking and rulemaking. Further, by leveraging our EU Issue Tracker, clients can take advantage of deeper policy monitoring capabilities and insights in the European Union. By harnessing workflow tools that help organizations manage their issues with insights provided by these products, stakeholders and teams are empowered to collaborate and drive more effective cross departmental knowledge management and coordination and communication on legal and regulatory issues.
Example Use Cases
 Enterprise clients use our technology to in-source their government affairs function, enabling them to reduce contractual commitments to trade organizations and achieve significant cost savings.
 Public sector clients leverage our technology to track the federal procurement process, enabling them to secure government funding in support of their mission.
 Industry associations leverage our technology to strategically allow their employees from different teams to work off the same information within the business, efficiently preparing for new business initiatives or quickly responding to questions from one place, reducing and consolidating different information channels, all fed by automatically sourced and updating information.
Advocacy & Constituent Services
Our advocacy tools, including VoterVoice and CQ Advocacy, empower citizens and organizations to connect with their governments. We provide solutions that enable organizations — from corporations to nonprofits to trade associations — to build campaigns, engage with advocates and educate lawmakers through multiple channels. Our tools also enable customers to track campaign performance with real-time, actionable reports, and insights with data-driven

recommendations for improved performance based on industry specific historical benchmarking analysis. Conversely, our Fireside product, which we acquired in 2021, supports legislators in their constituent engagement efforts by simplifying daily constituent communications, automating tasks, maintaining online and social media presence, and applying data to guide outreach efforts.
Example Use Cases
 A national trade association uses VoterVoice to revitalize its advocacy work through a digital strategy and mobile action after decades of trying to keep up in the industry.
 A congressional office uses Fireside’s powerful outreach tools to engage in a meaningful and coordinated fashion with constituents through surveys, newsletters, and mailing tools, and then further refine those engagement efforts through the collection and analysis of data regarding the congressional district.
Geopolitical and Market Intelligence
Our geopolitical and market intelligence services include FrontierView, and Oxford Analytica, which we acquired in 2021, and Dragonfly Intelligence, which we acquired in 2023. FrontierView provides strategic planning, market monitoring and intelligence to global business professionals in support of companies’ international growth initiatives. Oxford Analytica provides strategic geopolitical intelligence analysis of world events through its full-time staff and a global network of confirmed subject matter experts (now numbering over 1,500). Dragonfly provides real-time critical intelligence about potential and ongoing security risks to operations, early warning detection and forecasting through its "security intelligence & analysis service" (SIAS) platform. We believe that, by combining expert analysis with our core AI-driven analytics, our clients gain access to the full array of insights they need to understand how government actions and policies impact their organizations, businesses and industries.
Example Use Cases
 A multinational corporation engages FrontierView for customized research and analysis to adapt its pricing strategy to volatile emerging markets in which it seeks to expand.
 Through Oxford Analytica’s Daily Briefs, senior decision-makers at a technology company were presented with timely, impartial, and relevant analyses that helped them navigate through current events surrounding cybersecurity.
 Through Dragonfly's SIAS platform, a senior security and crisis management executive at a multinational corporation receives advance warning of events potentially disrupting its supply chain and operations abroad.
Customers
We serve a large, diverse customer base that includes small and mid-sized businesses, large enterprises (including over half of the Fortune 100), government agencies, law firms, professional services organizations, trade groups and non-profit around the world. We believe that the strong value proposition of the insights delivered by our platform, combined with expert analysis and workflow tools, leads to our substantial customer loyalty as evidenced by their high propensity to renew their subscriptions with us. As of December 31, 2022, our run-rate revenue (a key measure of our future revenue opportunity defined as annual recurring revenue at a point in time plus non-subscription revenue during the last twelve months) was $127.0 million. In addition, our net revenue retention (“NRR”) rate (for businesses we owned for at least twelve months at any point in time) on subscription customers was approximately 101% during the year ended December 31, 2022. Retention rates typically are higher for engagements with higher account values, which tend to involve more products with more complex and broader usage within a client organization. We believe that our business is not substantially dependent on any particular end market, customer or group of significant customers.
Technology
Our information technology systems are fundamental to our success. We guide users across a complex information ecosystem, presenting acquired and generated content, with machine-derived metadata, in tailored client workflows. Our technology stack includes technologies for the storage, processing, access and delivery of the data that forms the foundation of our business. We generally own or have secured ongoing rights to use all the applications material to our operations. Our patented AI-enabled core technologies are built and operated on top of modern cloud infrastructure, providing a reliable and distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations.

Our AI-driven analytical solutions empower our clients to track the pulse of legal and regulatory developments via:
 Descriptive analytics: vast database enabling trend identification, discovery and alerting, and analysis across jurisdictions, people, and documents.
 Predictive analytics: actionable insights such as legislative forecasts, automatic regulatory comment sentiment analysis, AI-driven personalized content and data recommendations to help clients make informed decisions.

 State-of-the-art data collection and ingestion, processing and augmentation, and storage automation capabilities including:
 Data ingestion: bespoke high-speed intelligent data sourcing and collection with custom scraping and monitoring frameworks from web sources, APIs, and data partnerships collecting unstructured text documents in multiple languages and multimedia audio, video, and image files.
 Data processing: augments raw source data by inferring and deriving metadata via natural language processing, including categorization, entity extraction, linking, and summarization, creating standardized and useable structured data formats.
 Data storage and management: structure, standardize, and automate synchronous and asynchronous data processing pipelines to validate, normalize and index primary data along with metadata to enable enhanced data retrieval and alerting across languages and jurisdictions.
 Data analytics: proprietary algorithms to drive custom natural language processes that enable predictions and analysis.
 
Our products are accessible through multiple delivery channels, including desktop and mobile applications, and data feeds and APIs, enabling our clients to work from anywhere at any time.

Competitive Environment
We believe the principal competitive factors in our business are the quality of insights that our customers can derive from our products and services, including their relevance to the policy and regulatory issues of greatest impact to their organizations, as well as the ease with which customers can act on those insights and integrate them into workflows that drive results. We believe we currently compete favorably with respect to each of these factors.

We consider ourselves a category creator in the technology-enabled global policy and market intelligence services sector. We believe that no single competitor currently offers the same scope of services and market coverage we provide, nor do we provide the same scope of services and market coverage as our competitors. The data and information analytics sector is highly fragmented, and we may encounter a variety of competitors depending upon the relevant market or product offering. Our competitors may include traditional information services companies such as Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg, and S&P, LexisNexis, legal advisors such as traditional law firms, as well as consultancies and traditional and digital media organizations that compete primarily with our Roll Call business. In addition, we may face competition from start-up and mid-sized companies, who may develop products or services that compete with discreet offerings within our portfolio. Over time, we believe that new businesses will increasingly enter the global policy and market intelligence information services sector and seek to develop technologies that may compete with our products and services.

Intellectual Property
 As of December 31, 2022, we owned 112 registered trademarks, seven trademark applications (in each case, counting individual foreign registrations and applications), approximately 537 domain names, nine patents, nine patents pending, and three patents allowed. We also own certain proprietary software. We consider our trademarks, service marks, databases, software and other IP to be proprietary, and rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret and patent), contractual and technical safeguards to protect our intellectual property rights. We believe that the intellectual property that we own and license is sufficient to permit us to carry on our business as presently conducted.

Our agreements with our customers and business partners place certain restrictions on the use of our intellectual property. As a general practice, employees, contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property and confidential information.

New Product Development
We believe that innovation is essential to our success and one of our primary drivers of competitive advantage. We believe we are in a unique position to help shape how organizations find, evaluate, interact with, consume and act upon global policy and market information. In 2022, we focused on the redevelopment of the FiscalNote and EU Issue Tracker platforms to better support integration of newly developed and acquired products and services while also providing enhanced user interfaces, analytical tools, and capabilities. Adding new data sets, products and services through acquisitions is also a significant component of our strategy. We also intend to continue augmenting our technology platform, products and services through strategic acquisitions.
Sales and Marketing
We generally develop sales, distribution and marketing strategies on a product-by-product and service-by-service basis, including products and services obtained via acquisitions. We leverage customer data, business and market intelligence and competitive profiling to retain customers and cross-sell products and services. When we obtain a new product or service through an acquisition, we assess on a case-by-case basis whether to integrate it into our existing product portfolio or maintain it as a standalone offering in light of its existing brand recognition, distinctive customer base and other factors.

Our sales teams participate in both sales and service activities, interacting frequently with assigned customers to ensure a positive experience using our products and services. Our sales force primarily seeks revenue through new sales, existing customer retention, upselling and cross-selling, working with the sales team members to coordinate activity and provide the best solutions for our customers.

Our marketing team seeks to position FiscalNote as the most trusted brand for insights and analysis on political, regulatory and policy matters. It promotes awareness of our brands through several channels, including segmented marketing campaigns and content (e.g., topical webinars), events, the FiscalNote Executive Institute (a thought leadership community that advances conversation and collaboration among senior leaders), and digital marketing.

Employees
As of December 31, 2022, approximately 800 employees support our business operations with approximately 720 full-time. None of our employees are represented by unions. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions to operations due to labor disagreements.
Regulatory Environment
Our products, services and operations are subject to privacy and consumer information laws and regulations, including regulations in the U.S. (federal and state), U.K., EU (as well as individual member states) and various jurisdictions in Asia. We incur significant costs in our business to comply with these laws and regulations. Our compliance obligations vary from regulator to regulator, and may include, among other things, strict data security programs, submissions of regulatory reports, providing consumers with certain notices and correcting inaccuracies in applicable reports. In addition, we are subject to regulatory requirements ordinarily associated with international operations, including various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, as well as export controls, customs, economic sanctions laws, and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws or export control, customs, or economic sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties. Many of these laws and regulations are complex, and their application to us, our customers or the specific services and relationships we have with our customers are not always clear. Our failure to anticipate accurately the application of these laws and regulations, or any failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and otherwise negatively affect our business. See the section titled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about the impact of government regulation on our company.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 Risks Related to Our Business
We have recently experienced significant growth that may not be indicative of future growth, which makes it difficult to forecast our revenue and evaluate our business and prospects. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.

We have experienced significant growth in our business, including through acquisitions, over the last several years. We have also experienced significant growth in headcount, the number of customers, and usage and amount of data delivered across our products and services.

You should not rely on the revenue growth of any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of future performance. Even if our revenue continues to increase, our revenue growth rate may decline in the future due to a variety of factors, including the maturation of our business, increased competition, changes to technology, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, or our failure, for any reason, to continue to take advantage of growth opportunities. The overall growth of our revenue depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:
 attract new customers, retain and expand sales to our existing customers, and price our products and services effectively;
 expand the functionality of our products and services, and continue to generate content and other insights that our customers value;
 maintain and expand the rates at which customers use our products and services and the prices at which we deliver our products and services;

 provide our customers with support that meets their needs;
 maintain or increase customer satisfaction with our products and services;
 compete effectively against other businesses offering similar products or services, as well as new entrants into the markets in which we compete;
 continue to introduce and sell our products and services to new markets and industry verticals;
 continue to develop new products and services, and maintain, enhance, develop, and integrate the functionality of our existing platforms, products and services, including continued innovation of our AI and data science technologies;
 successfully identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products and services;
 recruit, hire, train and manage additional qualified developers, professionals and sales and marketing personnel; and
 increase awareness of our brands on a global basis and successfully compete with other companies.
We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives, and as a result, it is difficult for us to forecast our future results of operations.

In addition, any growth places significant demands on our operational infrastructure. As usage of our products and services grows, we will need to devote additional resources to improving and maintaining our infrastructure and integrating with third-party applications, including open-source software. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including customer support and professional services, to serve our growing customer base. We also will need to focus significant resources on integrating acquired businesses and leveraging acquired products, services, content and analysis across the entire organization. Any failure of or delay in these efforts could lead to impaired system performance and reduced customer satisfaction, resulting in decreased sales to customers, lower dollar-based net retention rates, the issuance of service credits or requested refunds, which would hurt our revenue growth and our reputation. Even if we are successful in our expansion efforts, they will be expensive and complex, and require the dedication of significant management time and attention. We could also face inefficiencies or service disruptions as a result of our efforts to scale our internal infrastructure. We cannot be sure that the expansion of and improvements to our internal infrastructure will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all, and such failures could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our expenses and investments have grown significantly in recent years. We will need to grow our revenues to achieve and maintain profitability, which may not occur.

We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:
 our technology infrastructure, including systems architecture, scalability, availability, performance and security;
 sales and marketing, including a significant expansion of our sales organization to engage existing and prospective customers, increase brand awareness and drive adoption of our products and services;
 product development, including investments in our development team and the development of new applications of our products and services and new functionality for our existing applications and in the protection of our intellectual property (“IP”) rights related to our product development;
 acquisitions or strategic investments;
 international expansion; and
 general administration, including legal and accounting, expenses associated with being a public company.

These investments may not be successful on the timeline we anticipate or at all and may not result in increased revenue growth. If we are unable to maintain or increase our revenue at a rate sufficient to offset costs, our business, financial position and results of operations will be harmed and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability over the long term. Additionally, we have encountered, and may in the future encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known or unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. If our revenue growth does not meet our expectations in future periods, our business, financial position and results of operations may be harmed and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future, and we may be required to take cost-reduction actions that may limit our ability to execute on our strategic plans.
 

We have a history of net losses and anticipate that operating expenses may grow as we continue to pursue our plans for expansion, and we therefore may not be able to achieve and maintain profitability.

We have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of $218.3 million and $109.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. Because the market for our products and services is rapidly evolving, it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations or the limits of our market opportunity. Our operating expenses may continue to increase in the future as we hire additional personnel, expand our partnerships, operations and infrastructure, both domestically and internationally, and continue to enhance our products and services and develop and expand their features, integrations, and capabilities. We also intend to continue to build and enhance our platforms through both internal research and development and selectively pursuing acquisitions that can contribute to the capabilities of our platforms. In addition, now that we are a public company, we will incur additional significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. If our revenue does not increase to offset operating expenses and if our efforts to control operating expenses are unsuccessful or inadequate, we will not be profitable in future periods. In future periods, our revenue growth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including any failure to increase the number of organizations using our products or grow the size of our engagements with existing customers, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure, for any reason, to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities, slowing demand for our products, additional regulatory burdens, or increasing competition. As a result, our past financial performance may not be indicative of our future performance. Any failure by us to achieve or sustain profitability on a consistent basis could cause the value of our stock to decline.

We generate a significant percentage of our revenues from recurring subscription-based arrangements, and if we are unable to maintain a high renewal rate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.

Approximately 90% of our revenues are subscription-based. In order to maintain existing revenues and to generate higher revenues, we are dependent on a significant number of our customers renewing their arrangements with us. Although many of these arrangements have automatic renewal provisions, with appropriate notice these arrangements generally are cancellable and our customers generally have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after the expiration of their initial subscription period. As a result, our past annual revenue renewal rates may not be indicative of our future annual revenue renewal rates, and our annual revenue renewal rates may decline or fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, including customer satisfaction with our products and services, our prices and the prices offered by competitors, reductions in customer spending levels, and general economic conditions. Our revenues could also decline if a significant number of our customers continued their arrangements with us but reduced the amount of their spending.

The introduction of competitors’ offerings with lower prices for consumers, low customer satisfaction with our products, fluctuations in prices customers are willing to pay for our products, changes in customers’ government affairs, policy and political strategies, including an increase in the use of competitors’ products or offerings, and other factors could result in declines in our subscriptions. Because we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from customers who purchase these subscription plans, any material decline in demand for these offerings could have a material adverse impact on our future revenue and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to successfully introduce new products, features, and enhancements, our revenue growth may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
If we are unable to attract new customers, retain existing customers, expand our products and services offerings with existing customers, expand into new geographic markets or identify areas of higher growth, our revenue growth and profitability will be harmed.

Our success depends on our ability to acquire new customers, retain existing customers, expand our engagements with existing customers through cross-selling and upselling efforts, expand into new geographic markets and identify areas of higher growth, and to do so in a cost-effective manner. We have made significant investments related to customer acquisition and retention, expect to continue to spend significant amounts on these efforts in future periods, and cannot guarantee that the revenue from new or existing customers will ultimately exceed the costs of these investments.


Additionally, if we fail to deliver a quality user experience, or if customers do not perceive the products and services we offer to be of high value and quality, we may be unable to acquire or retain customers. Also, if we do not acquire or retain customers above our lowest price tier in volumes sufficient to grow our business, we may be unable to achieve our operational objectives. Our prices may increase, or may not decrease to levels sufficient to generate customers’ interest, our revenue may decrease, our margins may decline. As a result, we may not achieve or maintain profitability and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Our efforts to expand our service offerings and further develop our existing services in order to keep pace with policy, regulatory, political and technological developments may not succeed.

Our efforts to expand our current service offerings may not succeed and, as a result, we may not achieve the revenue growth rate we expect. In addition, because the markets for certain of our offerings remain relatively new, it is uncertain whether our investments in those offerings, will result in significant revenue for us. We seek to continuously enhance our technology platforms, including AI and machine learning capabilities and algorithms, to maintain and improve the quality of our products and services in order to remain competitive with alternatives, and those efforts ultimately may not be adequate or successful. Further, the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades, may not succeed and early-stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. Additionally, if we fail to anticipate or identify significant technology trends and developments early enough, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed.

If we are unable to develop or acquire enhancements to, and new features for, our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be harmed. The success of enhancements and new or acquired products and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement by customers, administrators and developers, as well as our ability to integrate all of our product and service offerings and develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth and negatively impact our operating results. We may not be successful in either developing or acquiring these enhancements and new products and services or effectively bringing them to market.

Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new services or technologies, or modifications to existing services or technologies, or changes in customer usage patterns thereof, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses or lead to our increased reliance on certain vendors. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business.

We plan to continue growing and expanding our business through strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to successfully identify attractive acquisition opportunities or make acquisitions on terms that are satisfactory to us from a commercial perspective.

A principal focus of our business strategy is to grow and expand our business, acquire technologies and new data sets, and enhance our product and service offerings through acquisitions. Our strategy of pursuing strategic acquisitions may be negatively impacted by several risks, including:
 We may not successfully identify companies that have complementary product lines or technological competencies or that can diversify our revenue or enhance our ability to implement our business strategy.
  We may not successfully acquire companies if we fail to negotiate the acquisition on acceptable terms, the potential acquisition target is acquired by a competitor or other bidder, or other related reasons.
 We may incur acquisition-related expenses, including legal, accounting, consulting, and other professional fees and disbursements. Such additional expenses may be material, will likely not be reimbursed, would increase the aggregate cost of any acquisition and could divert financial and managerial resources from existing operations.
 We may become exposed to the acquired company’s liabilities and to risks, and we may not be able to ascertain or assess all of the significant risks.
 We may require additional financing in connection with any future acquisition, and such financing may be unavailable or may adversely impact, or be restricted by, our capital structure.
 In the process of selecting suitable acquisition targets, we may make mistaken assumptions about the ease of entry into new markets, potential benefits, including volumes, cash flows, net sales, costs, synergies and more.


If we are not able to execute this strategy of pursuing strategic acquisitions, it could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business and on our financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects, and we may not be able to realize our projections.

We may not realize expected business or financial benefits from acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner, or such acquisitions could divert management’s attention, increase capital requirements or dilute stockholder value and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Our ability to achieve the anticipated potential benefits of a strategic acquisition will be subject to a number of risks or uncertainties. Acquired assets, data, or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations, costs in connection with acquisitions and integrations may be higher than expected and we may also incur unanticipated acquisition-related costs. These costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. Any acquisition we complete could be viewed negatively by customers, users, developers, partners, or investors, and could have adverse effects on our existing business relationships.

Acquisitions and other transactions, arrangements, and investments involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, any of which could harm our business, including:
 difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, administrative infrastructures, sales and marketing teams and strategies, personnel, technologies, data sets, services, and platforms;
 potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, impairments of goodwill or intangible assets, or potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers;
 difficulties in successfully selling any acquired services or products;
 differences between our values and those of our acquired companies;
 failures to identify material liabilities or risk in pre-acquisition due diligence;
 difficulties in retaining and re-training key employees of acquired companies and integrating them into our organizational structure and corporate culture;
 difficulties in, and financial costs of, addressing acquired compensation structures inconsistent with our compensation structure;
 inability to maintain, or changes in, relationships with key customers and partners of the acquired business;
 challenges converting and forecasting the acquired company’s revenue recognition policies including subscription-based revenue and revenue based on the transfer of control as well as appropriate allocation of the customer consideration to the individual deliverables;
 difficulty with, and costs related to, transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis;
 augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brands and reputation;
 potential for acquired products to impact the profitability of existing products;
 increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services;
 challenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability, and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership investments;
 negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets, and deferred compensation;
 to the extent we use cash to pay for acquisitions, the commensurate limitation of other potential uses for our cash;
 to the extent we incur debt to fund any acquisitions, the impact of such debt on our overall capital structure, any material restrictions thereunder on our ability to conduct our business financial maintenance covenants and dilution to shareholders to the extent such debt instruments are convertible;
  to the extent we issue equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease;
 additional dilution and expense associated with stock-based compensation;
 the loss of acquired unearned revenue and unbilled revenue;
 delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition;
 ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;
 in the case of foreign acquisitions, challenges caused by integrating operations over distance, and across different languages, cultures, and political environments;

 currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets;
 tax effects and costs of any such acquisitions, including the related integration into our tax structure and assessment of the impact on our ability to realize our future tax assets or liabilities; and
 potential challenges by governmental authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), for anti-competitive or other reasons.

We may also decide to restructure, divest or sell businesses, products or technologies that we have acquired or invested in. The occurrence of any of the above could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects and could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.

We have international operations and assets, including in the U.K., Belgium, Australia and Korea, and we sell our products and services to clients globally. These international operations subject us to additional risks that may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We have international operations, including in the U.K., Belgium, Australia and Korea. Our ability to operate in these countries may be adversely affected by changes in those jurisdictions’ laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, lobbying, cybersecurity, privacy and other matters. In addition, our operating results and financial performance are subject to the local economic and political situations. We believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance therewith, as well as increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations. There can be no certainty as to the application of the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions in particular instances. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation of laws inconsistent. Moreover, there is a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities, resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or transactions.

In addition, we sell our products and services globally and plan to continue expanding our international operations as part of our growth strategy. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 13% and 11%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from outside of the United States. Revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the FiscalNote selling entity, which may be different than the region of the customer.

Our current international operations and our plans to expand our international operations could subject us to a number of risks, including:
 increased management, travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with having multiple international operations;
 unique terms and conditions in contract negotiations imposed by clients in foreign countries;
 longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;
 the need to localize our products and services for international clients;
 changes in foreign regulatory requirements;
 increased exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
 highly inflationary international economies;
 the burdens and costs of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and legal standards relating to data security and protection of personal information, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the European Union and similar privacy regulations in the U.K. and the Asia-Pacific region;
 compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption regulations, particularly in emerging market countries;
 compliance by international staff with accounting practices generally accepted in the United States, including adherence to our accounting policies and internal controls;
 trade agreements, taxes, and other trade barriers;
 increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
 weaker protection of intellectual property rights in some countries;
 multiple and possibly overlapping tax regimes;
 the application of the respective local laws and regulations to our business in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate;

 government sanctions that may interfere with our ability to sell into particular countries;
 disruption to our operations caused by epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19; and
 political, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general.

As we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Any of these risks could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.

We recognize revenues over the term of the agreements for our subscriptions and, as a result, there is often a lag in realizing the impact of current sales or cancellations in reported revenues, and a significant downturn in our business may not be reflected immediately in our operating results.

We generally recognize revenues ratably over the duration of the contract, which typically range from one to three years. As a result, a substantial majority of our quarterly revenues are generated from contracts entered into during prior periods. There is often a lag in realizing the impact of current sales or cancellations in our reported revenues, as we recognize revenues over the term of the arrangement. Because of this lag effect, a decline in new contracts in any quarter may not affect our results of operations in that quarter but could reduce our revenues in future quarters. Additionally, the timing of renewals or non-renewals of a contract during any quarter may only affect our financial performance in future quarters. For example, the non-renewal of a contract late in a quarter will have minimal impact on revenues for that quarter but will reduce such revenues in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant declines in sales of our products and services may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations, which would make these reported results less indicative of our future financial results. In contrast, a non-renewal occurring early in a quarter may have a significant negative impact on revenues for that quarter and we may not be able to offset a decline in such revenues with revenues from new contracts entered into in the same quarter. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our costs in response to reduced revenues. These factors may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows, may make it challenging for an investor to predict our performance and may prevent us from meeting or exceeding the expectations of research analysts or investors, which in turn may cause our stock price to decline.

Our sales cycles are variable, depend upon factors outside our control, and could cause us to expend significant time and resources prior to generating revenues.

The typical sales cycle for our products and services is lengthy, unpredictable, could be disrupted by factors outside our control and often requires pre-purchase evaluation by a significant number of employees in our clients’ organizations. Our sales efforts involve educating our clients about the use and benefits of our products and services. Potential clients typically undertake a rigorous pre-purchase decision-making and evaluation process, and sales to new clients involve extensive client due diligence and reference checks. We invest a substantial amount of time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce sales. Even if we succeed at completing a sale, we may be unable to predict the size of an initial subscription arrangement until very late in the sales cycle.

If we have overestimated the size of our total addressable market, our future growth rate may be limited.

It is difficult to accurately estimate the size of the enterprise information services and legal and regulatory information markets and predict with certainty the rate at which the market for our services will grow, if at all. While our market size estimate was made in good faith and is based on assumptions and estimates we believe to be reasonable, this estimate may not be accurate. If our estimates of the size of our addressable market are not accurate, our potential for future growth may be less than we currently anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We rely on third parties, including public sources, for data, information and other products and services, and our relationships with such third parties may not be successful or may change, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Our products and services rely upon data, information and services obtained from third-party providers and public sources. Such data, information and services are made available to our customers or are integrated for our customers’ use

through information and technology solutions provided by us and third-party service providers. We have commercial relationships with third-party providers whose capabilities complement our own and, in some cases, these providers are also our competitors. The priorities and objectives of these providers, particularly those that are our competitors, may differ from ours, which may make us vulnerable to unpredicted price increases, unfavorable licensing terms and other adverse circumstances. Agreements with such third-party providers periodically come up for renewal or renegotiation, and there is a risk that such negotiations may result in different rights and restrictions, which could impact or eliminate our customers’ use of the content. In addition, as the number of products and services in our markets increases and the functionality of these products and services further overlaps with third-party products and services, we may become increasingly subject to claims by a third party that our products and services infringe on such party’s IP rights. Moreover, providers that are not currently our competitors may become competitors or be acquired by or merge with a competitor in the future, any of which could reduce our access to the information and technology solutions provided by those companies. If we do not maintain, or obtain the expected benefits from, our relationships with third-party providers or if a substantial number of our third-party providers or any key service providers were to withdraw their services, we may be less competitive, our ability to offer products and services to our customers may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.

If we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate, comprehensive, or reliable data, or if the expert analysis we produce contains any material errors or omissions, we could experience reduced demand for our products and services.

Our success depends on our customers’ confidence in the depth, breadth, and accuracy of our data. The task of establishing and maintaining accurate data is challenging and expensive. The depth, breadth, and accuracy of our data differentiates us from our competitors. If our data, including the data we obtain from third parties and our data extraction, structuring, and analytics are not current, accurate, comprehensive, or reliable, or if any expert analysis we produce contains material errors or omissions, customers could have negative experiences, which in turn would reduce the likelihood of customers renewing or upgrading their subscriptions and our reputation could be harmed, making it more difficult to obtain new customers.

Our ability to introduce new features, integrations, capabilities, and enhancements is dependent on adequate research and development resources. If we do not adequately fund our research and development efforts, or if our research and development investments do not translate into material enhancements to our products and services, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.

To remain competitive, we must continue to develop or acquire and implement new features, integrations, and capabilities to our products and services. This is particularly true as we further expand and diversify our capabilities to address additional applications and markets. Maintaining adequate research and development resources, such as the appropriate personnel and development technology, to meet the demands of the market is essential. If we are unable to develop features, integrations, and capabilities internally due to certain constraints, such as employee turnover, lack of management ability, or a lack of other research and development resources, our business may be harmed.

Moreover, research and development projects can be technically challenging and expensive. The nature of these research and development cycles may cause us to experience delays between the time we incur expenses associated with research and development and the time we are able to offer compelling features, integrations, capabilities, and enhancements and generate revenue, if any, from such investment. Anticipated demand for a feature, integration, capability, or enhancement we are developing could decrease after the development cycle has commenced, and we would nonetheless be unable to avoid substantial costs associated with the development of any such feature, integration, capability, or enhancement. Additionally, we may experience difficulties with software development, design, or marketing that could affect the length of these research and development cycles that could further delay or prevent our development, introduction, or implementation of features, integrations, capabilities, and enhancements. If we expend a significant amount of resources on research and development and our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction or improvement of features, integrations, and capabilities that are competitive, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.


Further, our competitors may expend more on their respective research and development programs or may be acquired by larger companies that would allocate greater resources to our competitors’ research and development programs or our competitors may be more efficient or effective in their research and development activities. We can expect continuous improvements in computer hardware, network operating systems, programming tools, programming languages, operating systems, data matching, data filtering, data predicting, and other database technologies and the use of the internet. These improvements, as well as changes in customer preferences or regulatory requirements, may require changes in the technology used to gather and process our data. Our failure to maintain adequate research and development resources or to compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors would give an advantage to such competitors and may harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Our pricing and product bundling strategy may not meet customers’ price expectations or may adversely affect our revenues.

Demand for our products and services is generally sensitive to price. Our approach to pricing and bundling our products and services has had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our revenues and profit margins. In addition, our competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies are beyond our control and could significantly affect the results of our pricing strategies. If we fail to meet our customers’ price expectations or develop attractive and easily marketable product bundles, or if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors when they engage in aggressive pricing strategies or other competitive activities, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources that offer comparable value to customers may reduce demand for our products and services.

In recent years, more public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become available, particularly through the Internet, and this trend is expected to continue. For example, the US Congress, state legislatures, the European Union and other federal, state, local and foreign government and regulatory agencies have increased the amount of information they make publicly available at no cost. Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products and services if such information sources become more easily searchable, digestible and actionable without structuring by technology such as ours. Our results of operations would be adversely affected if our customers choose to use these public sources as a substitute for our products or services.

Larger and more well-funded companies with access to significant resources, large amounts of data or data collection methods, and sophisticated technologies may shift their business model to become our direct competitors.

Companies in related industries, such as Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters, RELX, MSCI, Gartner, and S&P, may choose to compete with us and would immediately have access to greater resources and brand recognition. We cannot anticipate how rapidly such a potential competitor could create products or services that would take significant market share from us or even surpass our products or services in quality. The entry of a large, well-funded competitor in our space could reduce demand for our products and services or reduce the price we can demand from new customers or for subscription renewals or upgrades from existing customers, negatively affecting our revenue and profitability.

If we fail to protect and maintain our brands, our ability to attract and retain customers will be impaired, our reputation may be harmed, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may suffer.

We have developed or acquired a family of brands, that have contributed significantly to the success of our businesses. We believe that maintaining and promoting our brands in a cost-effective manner is critical to expanding our base of customers and retaining our existing customers. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brands and the reputation of our businesses will depend on our ability to provide useful, reliable, secure, and innovative products and services, to maintain trust, and to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience.

We may introduce, or make changes to, features, products, services, privacy practices, or terms of service that customers do not like, which may materially and adversely affect one or more of our brands. Our brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brands. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our businesses could be materially and adversely harmed.


Harm to our brands can arise from many sources, including failure by us or our partners and service providers to satisfy expectations of service and quality, inadequate protection or misuse of information with respect to customers’ government affairs’ strategies, personally identifiable information, compliance failures and claims, regulatory inquiries and enforcement, rumors, litigation and other claims, misconduct by our partners, employees or other counterparties, and actual or perceived failure to adequately address the environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) expectations of our various stakeholders, any of which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers.

Any negative publicity about our industry or our company, the quality and reliability of our products and services, our compliance and risk management processes, changes to our products and services, our ability to effectively manage and resolve customer complaints, our privacy, data protection, and information security practices, litigation, regulatory licensing and infrastructure, and the experience of our customers with our products or services could adversely affect our reputation and the confidence in and use of our products and services. If we do not successfully maintain strong and trusted brands, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We have a significant portion of our revenue to U.S. and foreign government agencies and other highly regulated organizations, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks.
 
We derive a portion of our revenue from contracts with government organizations (primarily but not solely U.S. -based), and we believe the success and growth of our business will in part depend on adding additional public sector customers. However, demand from government organizations is often unpredictable, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain or grow our revenue from the public sector. Sales to government entities are subject to substantial additional risks that are not present in sales to other customers, including:
 selling to government agencies can be more highly competitive, expensive, and time-consuming than sales to other customers, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that such efforts will generate a sale;
 U.S., European, or other government certification and audit requirements potentially applicable to our network, including the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) in the U.S., are often difficult and costly to obtain and maintain, and failure to do so will restrict our ability to sell to government customers;
 government demand and payment for our products may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles, funding authorizations, changes in administration, shifts in government agency spending patterns, delays in the government appropriations or other administrative processes, or government shutdowns or other considerations, such as favoring domestic suppliers over those with significant foreign minority investment, such as ours, especially in the case of notable levels of redemption;
 governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in fines, civil or criminal liability, further investigations, damage to our reputation, and debarment from further government business;
 governments often require contract terms that differ from our standard customer arrangements, including terms that can lead to those customers obtaining broader rights in our products than would be expected under a standard commercial contract and terms that can allow for early termination; and
 governments may demand better pricing terms and public disclosure of such pricing terms, which may harm our ability to negotiate pricing terms with our non-government customers.

The loss or significant curtailment of any government contracts or subcontracts, whether due to our performance or due to interruptions or changes in governmental funding or administrative processes, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of contracts with the public sector, including U.S. federal, state, and local governmental organizations, which affect how we and our channel partners do business with governmental agencies. Selling our products to the U.S. government, whether directly or through channel partners, also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations, fines, and other penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, the DOJ and the General Services Administration (the “GSA”) have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with vendors under the False Claims Act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with

certain provisions of GSA contracts for sales to the federal government. The DOJ and GSA continue to actively pursue such claims. Violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition. Any inability to address these risks and challenges could reduce the commercial benefit to us or otherwise preclude us from selling subscriptions to our products to government organizations.

We assist customers in certain legislative and other governmental relations matters, which activities may be deemed to be lobbying efforts.

To the extent that our services may be activities that constitute “lobbying” under federal, state, local or foreign laws, we or some of our subsidiaries may have to register under such applicable laws. In addition, some states have so-called procurement lobbying rules that require sales personnel who interact with governmental officials in certain sales activities to register as lobbyists as well. Lobbying laws typically require periodic financial and other reports to be timely made and prohibit some types of contributions, gifts and other expenditures by lobbyists and their affiliates. Any failure to register or to comply with the applicable regulations could subject us, our employees and officers and directors to civil or criminal penalties.

Our company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as it grows, including through acquisition, our business could be materially and adversely affected.

We believe our culture has been a key contributor to our success to date and that the critical nature of the products and services that we provide promotes a sense of greater purpose and fulfillment in our employees. We have invested in building a strong corporate culture and believe it is one of our most important competitive advantages. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, which is critical to our growth, and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. As we continue to grow and develop, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our culture. In addition, as our operations become more globally dispersed, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain our corporate culture across geographies. If we fail to maintain our corporate culture, or if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel, our business and competitive position may be harmed.

We rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel, including our management and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of such personnel, or of a significant number of team members, could harm our business.

We believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of senior management and key personnel, including our co-founders. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives and key employees, which could disrupt our business. Our senior management and key employees are employed on an at-will basis. We may be unable to retain members of senior management or other key employees and may be unable to timely replace such individuals should any of them depart. The loss of one or more of our senior management or other key employees could harm our business.

If we do not effectively maintain and grow our research and development team with top talent, including employees who are trained in AI, machine learning and advanced algorithms, we may be unable to continue to improve our AI capabilities, and our revenues and other results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our future success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees, software engineers and other employees with the technical skills in AI, machine learning and advanced algorithms that will enable us to deliver effective products and services. Competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is intense, in particular in the fields of AI and data science, and larger companies with access to more substantial resources pursue such top talent aggressively.

We may be unable to attract or retain such highly skilled personnel who are critical to our success, which could hinder our ability to keep pace with innovation and technological change in our industry or result in harm to our key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or proprietary knowledge and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. The loss of the services of such key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals.


Regulators in the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we operate may limit our ability to develop or implement our proprietary technology and/or may eliminate or restrict the confidentiality of our proprietary technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our future success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement our proprietary technology, and to maintain the confidentiality of this technology. Changes to existing regulations, their interpretation or implementation, or new regulations, including in connection with obtaining and extracting data from third parties, could impede our use of this technology, or require that we disclose our proprietary technology to others, including our competitors, which could impair our competitive position and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Issues in the use of AI (including machine learning) in our platforms may result in reputational harm or liability.

AI enables or is integrated into some of our platforms and is a significant and potentially growing element of our business. As with many developing technologies, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its further development, adoption, and use, and therefore our business. Further, AI algorithms may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient, of poor quality, or contain biased information. In addition, inappropriate or controversial data practices by data scientists, engineers, and end-users of our systems could impair the acceptance of AI solutions. If the recommendations, forecasts, or analyses that AI applications assist in producing are deficient or inaccurate, we could be subjected to competitive harm, potential legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. Further, some AI scenarios may present ethical issues. Though our technologies and business practices are designed to mitigate many of these risks, if we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their purported or real impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm.

Failure to effectively optimize our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base, expand our engagements with existing customers, and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and services.

Our ability to increase our customer base, expand our engagements with existing customers, and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and services will significantly depend on our ability to optimize our marketing and sales operations. We plan to dedicate significant resources to sales, marketing and demand-generation teams and programs, including various online marketing activities as well as targeted account-based advertising. We also intend to focus on cross-selling and upselling efforts to grow our engagements at existing clients. The effectiveness of these efforts has varied over time and may vary in the future. All of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources and if they fail to attract additional customers, our business will be harmed. If our lead generation methods do not result in broader market acceptance of our products and services, we will not realize the intended benefits of this strategy and our business will be harmed.

We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel, including sales representatives, sales managers and sales engineers, with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend in large part on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, if at all, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. In addition, particularly if we continue to grow rapidly, new members of our sales force will have relatively little experience working with us, our products and services and our business model. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, our sales personnel do not reach significant levels of productivity in a timely manner, or our sales personnel are not successful in acquiring new customers or expanding usage by existing customers, our business will be harmed.

Any failure to offer high-quality support, professional services and information and analysis for our customers may harm our relationships with our customers and, consequently, our business.

Once our products and services are deployed, our customers sometimes request consulting and training to assist them in integrating our products and services into their business and rely on our customer support personnel to resolve issues and

realize the full benefits that our products and services provide. Our ability to provide effective customer support is largely dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel with experience in supporting customers with a cloud solution such as ours and maintaining the same. The number of our customers has grown significantly, which is likely to increase demand for training, support and maintenance related to our products and services and place additional pressure on our customer support teams. If we are unable to provide sufficient high-quality training, integration and maintenance resources, our customers may not effectively integrate our products and services into their business or realize sufficient business value from our products and services to justify further usage, which could impact our future financial performance. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for technical support or maintenance assistance. We also may be unable to modify the future, scope and delivery of our maintenance services and technical support to compete with changes in the technical services provided by our competitors.

Increased customer demand for support and professional services, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and negatively affect our operating results. In addition, as we continue to grow our operations and support our global customer base, we need to be able to continue to provide efficient support and effective maintenance that meets our customers’ needs globally at scale. Our ability to attract new customers is highly dependent on our business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality support services, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support services for our customers, would harm our business.

Certain of our customers rely on high quality information in the form of research, news and analysis. Our ability to provide these services at the levels our clients expect is dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel. In addition, for certain of these services, our personnel receive special access to the U.S. Congress through the Periodical Press Galleries and Daily Press Galleries. If such access were to be limited or restricted for any reason, our ability to obtain certain information would be hindered, and such event could have a negative impact on our customers’ perception of the value of our services, thus potentially impacting revenue.

Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business.

We are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. In certain jurisdictions, we could be a subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or that we believe are invalid or inapplicable. This could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how we operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of customers. Further, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We have incurred a significant amount of debt, some of which is secured by substantially all of our assets, and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had $164.3 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $150.6 million was secured by substantially all of our assets and $13.7 million was unsecured.

Concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination, FiscalNote, Inc., our wholly owned indirect subsidiary, entered into a new senior secured term loan facility (the "New Senior Term Loan") providing for an aggregate principal amount of up to $150.0 million in indebtedness, which refinanced certain indebtedness outstanding prior to the closing on amended terms, as well as potential incremental loan facility of up to an additional $100.0 million upon our satisfaction of certain conditions to the availability thereof.

The New Senior Term Loan requires monthly cash interest payments. Beginning August 15, 2025, we will also be required to make monthly principal payments of approximately $3.1 million through the maturity date, July 15, 2027 (excluding any amounts drawn on the uncommitted incremental loan facility, which at December 31, 2022 we had not drawn down on the uncommitted incremental loan facility). Upon maturity, we will then be required to repay the then outstanding balance. Accordingly, a portion of our future cash flows from operations will be required to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital

expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations.
 
Under our New Senior Term Loan, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to financial maintenance covenants and restrictive covenants limiting our business and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. We may be unable to comply with any financial maintenance covenants and/or restrictive covenants which may result in a default under the New Senior Term Loan (See Part II, Item 8, "Note 9 - Debt."). In the future, any debt financing obtained by us could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay or refinance such indebtedness immediately. In such event, we may be unable to repay our indebtedness or refinance such indebtedness on reasonable terms, if at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We recently announced on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 27, 2023 in conjunction with the acquisition of Dragonfly Eye Limited ("Dragonfly") that the Company issued approximately £9.0 million pounds in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes (the "Dragonfly Convertible Notes") to eligible sellers in the transaction. The Dragonfly Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum payable in kind in arrears. During the term of each Dragonfly Convertible Note, the principal amount thereof and accrued interest thereon will be convertible into the Company's Class A Common Stock in the following scenarios:
 
beginning on the 18-month anniversary of the date of issuance (the “Issuance Date”), a holder may convert, at its option, at the initial conversion price of $10.00 per share of Class A Common Stock (the “Conversion Price”);
beginning on the 18-month anniversary of the Issuance Date, the holders of at least a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Dragonfly Convertible Notes may elect to convert the aggregate principal amount of all Dragonfly Convertible Notes, and accrued interest thereon, into Class A Common Stock at the Conversion Price;
subject to certain limitations, if the VWAP of the Company's Class A Common Stock during any five consecutive trading day period following August 2, 2023 exceeds $11.50 per share, the Company may elect to convert all of the Dragonfly Convertible Notes into the Company's Class A Common Stock at the Conversion Price; and
after August 2, 2023, the Company may elect to convert the Dragonfly Convertible Notes into Class A Common Stock at a price per share equal to the current VWAP of the the Company's Class A Common Stock.
 
In addition, we recently announced on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 27, 2023 that we entered into a term sheet with GPO FN Noteholder LLC (the “Disputing Lender”) to issue a subordinated convertible promissory note in the initial principal amount of $46,794 (the "New Note") which would bear interest at a rate of 7.50% per annum in order to settle certain claims asserted by the Disputing Lender with respect to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock received as a result of the Business Combination. If we successfully negotiate and enter into the definitive agreements related to such convertible note, our total leverage will increase and the note may be dilutive to our existing shareholders in connection with a future conversion event.
 
We are involved in legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business from time to time. Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit the ability to operate our business.

We have in the past been, and may in the future be, involved in private actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by customers, employees, lenders, commercial partners, competitors, or government agencies, among others, relating to, for example, wrongful act, subrogation, employment or labor-related disputes such as wrongful termination of employment, assisting in, inducement of or involvement in breach of restrictive covenants, non-disclosure or confidentiality obligations by our employees, consumer complaints, contractual disputes with customers or suppliers,

disputes with third parties and regulatory inquiries. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and may be expensive. For example, we may not successfully enter into definitive documentation with the Disputing Lender with respect to its claim even after undertaking significant time and an incurring significant expense to do so. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into any settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which it operates its business or restricts its solicitation with potential customers or employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Our projections and key performance metrics are subject to significant risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties. As a result, our financial and operating results may differ materially from our expectations.

We operate in a rapidly changing and competitive industry, and its projections and calculations of key operating metrics are subject to the risks and assumptions made by our management with respect to our industry. Operating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on a number of factors, including the competition we face, as well as our ability to attract and retain customers while generating sustained revenues through product and service offerings. Additionally, our business and its ability to generate revenue may be affected by reductions in customer spending and investing from time to time as a result of a number of factors, which may be difficult to predict. We may be unable to adopt measures in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in income. Any of these factors could cause our operating results in a given quarter to be higher or lower than expected, which makes creating accurate forecasts and budgets challenging. As a result, we may fall materially short of our forecasts and expectations, including with respect to our key operating metrics, which could cause our stock price to decline and investors to lose confidence in us, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts included herein are based on data published by third parties and on internally generated data and assumptions, which are subject to significant uncertainty and limitations and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate, reliable or complete. We have not independently verified any third-party information and cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. While we believe our market size estimates are reasonable, such information is inherently imprecise. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecasted herein, our business could fail to grow for a variety of reasons, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.

Our use of any “open-source” software under restrictive licenses could: (i) adversely affect our ability to license and commercialize certain elements of our proprietary code based on the commercial terms of our choosing; (ii) result in a loss of our trade secrets or other intellectual property rights with respect to certain portions of our proprietary code; and (iii) subject us to litigation and other disputes.
 
We have incorporated certain third-party “open-source” software (“OSS”) or modified OSS into elements of our proprietary code base in connection with the development of our products and services. In general, this OSS has been incorporated and is used pursuant to ‘permissive’ OSS licenses, which are designed to be compatible with our use and commercialization of our own proprietary code base. However, we have also incorporated and use some OSS under restrictive OSS licenses. Under these restrictive OSS licenses, we could be required to release to the public the source code of certain elements of our proprietary software that: (i) incorporate OSS or modified OSS in a certain manner; and (ii) have been conveyed or distributed to the public, or with which the public interacts. Although we monitor our use of OSS, in addition to the use of OSS that we are aware of, there is a risk that OSS will be inadvertently or impermissibly incorporated into our software, including by our developers or service providers. In some cases, we may be required to ensure that elements of our proprietary software are licensed to the public on the terms set out in the relevant OSS license or at no cost. This could allow competitors to use certain elements of our proprietary software on a relatively unrestricted basis, or develop similar software at a lower cost. In addition, open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties for their open-source software, and the open-source software may contain security vulnerabilities that we must actively manage or patch. It may be necessary for us to commit substantial resources to remediate our use of OSS under restrictive OSS licenses, for example by engineering alternative or work-around code.


There is an increasing number of open-source software license types, and the terms under many of these licenses are unclear or ambiguous, and have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and therefore, the potential impact of such licenses on our business is not fully known or predictable. As a result, these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our own proprietary code (and in particular the elements of our proprietary code which incorporates OSS or modified OSS). Furthermore, we could become subject to lawsuits or claims challenging our use of open-source software or compliance with open-source license terms. If unsuccessful in these lawsuits or claims, we could face IP infringement or other liabilities, be required to seek costly licenses from third parties for the continued use of third-party IP, be required to re-engineer elements of our proprietary code base (e.g., for the sake of avoiding third-party IP infringement), discontinue or delay the use of infringing aspects of our proprietary code base (such as if re-engineering is not feasible), or disclose and make generally available, in source code form, certain elements of our proprietary code. Any such re-engineering or other remedial efforts could require significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to successfully complete any such re-engineering or other remedial efforts.

More broadly, the use of OSS can give rise to greater risks than the use of commercially acquired software, since open-source licensors usually limit their liability in respect of the use of the OSS, and do not provide support, warranties, indemnifications or other contractual protections regarding the use of the OSS, which would ordinarily be provided in the context of commercially acquired software.

Any of the foregoing could adversely impact the value of certain elements of our proprietary code base, and its ability to enforce its intellectual property rights in such code base against third parties. In turn, this could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We may not be able to adequately obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our proprietary and intellectual property rights in our data or technology.

Our success depends in part on our and our licensors’ success in obtaining and maintaining effective intellectual property protection. We may be unsuccessful in adequately protecting our intellectual property. We may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce or license all necessary or desirable intellectual property applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner, or in all jurisdictions. Any failure to obtain or maintain patent and other intellectual property protection may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We depend on our proprietary technology, intellectual property and services for our success and ability to compete. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties with whom we have relationships and who may have access to confidential or other protectable aspects of our research and development outputs, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We cannot guarantee employees, consultants, or other parties will comply with confidentiality, non-disclosure, or invention assignment agreements or that such agreements will otherwise be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and services, or certain aspects of our products and services, and proprietary information. Additionally, we may be subject to claims from third parties challenging our ownership interest in or inventorship of intellectual property we regard as our own, for example, based on claims that its agreements with employees or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations to assign inventions to another employer, to a former employer, or to another person or entity. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing products and services that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products and services. Additionally, certain unauthorized use of our intellectual property may go undetected, or we may face legal or practical barriers to enforcing our legal rights even where unauthorized use is detected.
 
Our applications for registration of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be approved. Although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties in the course of business, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such outputs before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek and obtain patent protection. We may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions, and under the laws of certain jurisdictions, patents or other intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in scope. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our developments before it is too late to obtain patent protection. In addition, our ability to obtain and maintain

valid and enforceable patents depends in part on whether the differences between our inventions and the prior art allow its inventions to be patentable over the prior art.

In addition, we rely substantially upon trademarks to build and maintain the integrity of our brands. Our trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared unenforceable or determined to be violating or infringing on other intellectual property rights. We may not be able to sufficiently protect or successfully enforce our rights to these trademarks and trade names.

Current law may not provide for adequate protection of our data or technology. In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet-related businesses are uncertain and evolving, and changes in these standards may adversely impact the viability or value of our proprietary rights. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer, and disclosure of our technology, or certain aspects of our technology, or our data may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Further, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries may be inadequate. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our data or technology, or certain aspects of our data or technology, may increase. Further, competitors, foreign governments, foreign government-backed actors, criminals, or other third parties may gain unauthorized access to our data and technology. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.

To protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights, and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by our customers or third parties. Litigation has been and may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. Such litigation could be costly, time consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce its intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our products and services, impair the functionality of our products and services, delay introductions of new features, integrations, and capabilities, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies, or injure our reputation. In addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new features, integrations, and capabilities, and we cannot be certain that we could license that technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and our inability to license this technology could harm our ability to compete.

We may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement, misappropriation or other violation of proprietary intellectual property rights.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the patents and other proprietary intellectual property rights of third parties. This is generally referred to as having the “freedom to operate.” Because we have only conducted routine searches related to third party patent filings and publications and have not conducted an in-depth freedom to operate search, which is time consuming and costly, we may not be aware of issued patents that a third party might assert are infringed by our current products and services, which could materially impair our ability to commercialize our current or any future products and services. Even if we diligently search third-party intellectual property for potential infringement by our current or any future products and services, we may not successfully find intellectual property that our current or any future products and services may infringe. If we are unable to secure and maintain the freedom to operate, third parties could preclude us from commercializing our current or future products and services. There is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our market, and litigation, based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property, is frequent in internet-based industries. We may receive communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.

In addition, we may be sued by third parties for breach of contract, defamation, negligence, unfair competition, or patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation, or claims based on other theories, which may or may not be brought without merit. We could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website and other outlets through links to other websites or information on our website or other

outlets supplied by third parties or claims that our alleged collection of information from third-party sites without a license violates certain federal or state laws or website terms of use. We could also be subject to claims that the collection or provision of certain information breached laws or regulations relating to privacy or data protection. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property claims, interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings, both in the United States and internationally, involve complex legal and factual questions. As a result, such proceedings are lengthy, costly and time-consuming, and their outcome is highly uncertain. We may become involved in protracted and expensive litigation in order to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others, or to determine whether we have the freedom to operate with respect to the intellectual property rights of others.
If we are found to infringe a third-party’s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third-party to continue developing and marketing our current and any future products or services. We may also elect to enter into such a license to settle pending or threatened litigation. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us and could require us to pay significant royalties and other fees. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing products or services. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, which may be significant. If we are found to have willfully infringed a third-party patent, we could be required to pay treble damages and attorneys’ fees. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our planned products or services in commercially important jurisdictions, or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could harm our business.

Even if we are successful in defending against intellectual property claims, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to such claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities.

Furthermore, our agreements with some of our customers, suppliers or other entities with whom we do business may require us to defend or indemnify these parties to the extent they become involved in infringement claims, including the types of claims described above. We could also voluntarily agree to defend or indemnify third parties in instances where we are not obligated to do so if we determine it would be beneficial to our business relationships. If any of these claims succeed or settle, we may be forced to pay damages or settlement payments on behalf of our customers, suppliers or other entities, or may be required to obtain licenses. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products or services. If we are required or agree to defend or indemnify third parties in connection with any infringement claims, we could incur significant costs and expenses that could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.

Additionally, there are potential issues around possible ownership rights in personal data, which is subject to evolving regulatory oversight. As a result of any claims against us regarding suspected infringement, our technologies may be subject to injunction, we may be required to pay damages, or we may have to seek a license to continue certain practices (which may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all), all of which may significantly increase our operating expenses or may require us to restrict our business activities and limit our ability to deliver our products and services and/or certain features, integrations, and capabilities of our products and services. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and/or cause it to alter our products or services, which could negatively affect our business. Further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, so any alleged infringement by us resulting in claims against such customers would increase our liability.

Our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may increase due to acquisitions of other companies. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to such acquisition.

We are subject to sanctions, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and harm our business and reputation.

We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, U.S. domestic bribery laws, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and other anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities.

Due to the international scope of our operations, we must comply with these laws in each jurisdiction where we operate. Additionally, many anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, have long-arm statutes that can expand the applicability of these laws to our operations worldwide. Accordingly, we must incur significant operational costs to support our ongoing compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws at all levels of our business. If we fail to comply with these laws, we may be subject to significant penalties. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees and their third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. As we increase our international and public sector sales and businesses, we may engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to market our products and services and to obtain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals. In addition, we or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries and our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.

While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot guarantee that all of our employees and agents will comply with our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase.

Detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of anti-corruption laws can require a significant diversion of time, resources and attention from senior management. In addition, noncompliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, other civil or criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal proceeding, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.

We may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could adversely impact our results of operations.

Our international sales are generally denominated in foreign currencies, and these revenues could be materially affected by currency fluctuations as we expand our international operations. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our results of operations may be impacted by transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Moreover, significant and unforeseen changes in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to fail to achieve our stated projections for revenues and operating income, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. We will continue to experience fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which, if material, may harm our revenues or results of operations as we expand our international operations.

We have entered into certain licensing agreements and other strategic relationships with third parties. These agreements and relationships may not continue and we may not be successful in entering into other similar agreements and relationships. If we fail to maintain our current licensing agreements or establish new relationships, it could result in loss of revenue and harm our business and financial condition or inability for us to use the intellectual property licensed to us by the applicable third party.

We have licensed certain components of our technologies from third parties and rely upon such licenses, in part, for the successful development and commercialization of certain technologies, products services. The success of certain of our products and services may depend on maintaining successful relationships with our third-party license partners. If such license agreements were to terminate prematurely or if we breach the terms of any licenses or otherwise fails to maintain such licenses, we may lose the ability to offer certain products and services that use such licenses. If there are no active statements of work, counterparties may have the right to terminate such license agreements for its convenience. In addition, we may need to obtain licenses to additional technologies in the future in order to keep our products and services competitive. If we fail to license or otherwise acquire and maintain necessary technologies, we may not be able to develop new products and services necessary to remain competitive.


We also license our intellectual property for use by third party partners in exchange for payment obligations to us. If any of these license agreements expire or terminate prematurely, we would lose the revenue we receive in connection with such payment obligation. Further, we may, from time to time, elect to enter into exclusive licensing arrangements of portions of our content, which may limit our ability to enter into alternative licensing arrangements that may be more advantageous to us in the future.

We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. While we are working to remediate any material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.

We have historically had a small internal accounting and finance staff. This lack of adequate accounting resources has resulted in the identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, including material weaknesses identified in connection with the audit of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. A “material weakness” is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with the audits of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our management team identified the following material weaknesses:
 we did not design and maintain formal accounting policies, processes, and controls for (a) analyzing, accounting for and disclosing certain complex transactions, (b) accounting for income tax provision, (c) valuation of financial instruments, (d) preparation and disclosure of earnings per share, (e) accounting for loss contingencies, and (f) controls over administrative access to our accounting and finance systems and system change management.

We are committed to remediating the material weaknesses described above and have been proactively working through remediation efforts in 2022. We initiated and implemented several remediation measures including, but not limited to: hiring a CPA licensed Chief Accounting Officer and additional accounting staff with requisite background and knowledge, engaging third parties to assist us in complying with the accounting and financial reporting requirements related to significant and complex transactions, and assist us with formalizing our business processes, accounting policies and internal control documentation, strengthening supervisory reviews by our management, and evaluating the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the framework established by Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. While our efforts are ongoing, we plan to continue to take additional steps to remediate the material weaknesses, improve our financial reporting systems, and implement new policies, procedures, and controls; however, we cannot guarantee those measures will prevent or detect material weaknesses in the future.

Although we have initiated our remediation efforts, identified material weaknesses continue to exist as of the date of this filing. Further, we cannot provide any assurance that we, or our independent registered accounting firm, will not identify new material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting in the future.

As a private company, Legacy FiscalNote did not endeavor to establish and/or maintain public company-quality internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting as a public company, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our shares may decline.

Pursuant to Section 404 and in light of SEC guidance, management is required to report our assessment of internal control over financial reporting beginning with coverage of the first full fiscal year following the Business Combination (in our case, the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023), and if and when FiscalNote becomes an accelerated filer or large accelerated filer who is not eligible to be a smaller reporting company and has annual revenues of at least $100.0 million (and ceases to be an emerging growth company), an attestation of the independent registered public accounting firm will also be required. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. To comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act and any complex

accounting rules in the future, we may need to upgrade our legacy information technology systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, and hire additional accounting and finance staff or retain additional outside consultants.

Legacy FiscalNote historically identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting and we cannot guarantee that there will be none for us in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.

Our risk management processes and procedures may not be effective.

We are commencing work to adopt comprehensive risk management processes and procedures in 2023. While we have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and control certain types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, strategic risk, operational risk, cybersecurity risk, and reputational risk, those procedures may not be effective.

Risk is inherent in our business, and therefore, despite our efforts to manage risk, there can be no assurance that we will not sustain unexpected losses. We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted to the extent our business model, operational processes, control functions, technological capabilities, risk analyses, and business/product knowledge do not adequately identify and manage potential risks associated with our strategic initiatives. There also may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated, including when processes are changed or new products and services are introduced. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify and control its risks, we could suffer unexpected losses or be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We operate in competitive markets and may be adversely affected by this competition.

The markets for our products and services are competitive and are subject to rapid technological changes and evolving customer demands and needs. We compete on the basis of various factors, including the quality of the insights that our products and services deliver, the quality of our competitors’ solutions, customers’ perception of our products and services relative to the value that they deliver, and the quality of our user interfaces and the overall customer experience.

Some of our principal competitors are established companies that have substantial financial resources, recognized brands, technological expertise and market experience, and these competitors may have more established positions in certain product lines and geographies than we do. We also compete with smaller and sometimes newer companies, some of which are specialized with a narrower focus than our company, and face competition from enterprise information services and legal and regulatory information companies.

Our competitors may be able to adopt new or emerging technologies or address customer requirements more quickly than we can. New and emerging technologies can also have the impact of allowing start-up companies to enter the market more quickly than they would have been able to in the past. We may also face increased competition from companies that could pose a threat to our business by providing more in-depth offerings, adapting their products and services to meet the demands of their customers or combining with one of their competitors to enhance their products and services. A number of our principal competitors may continue to make acquisitions as a means to improve the competitiveness of their offerings. In order to better serve the needs of our existing customers and to attract new customers, we must continue to:
 enhance and improve our existing products and services (such as by adding new content);
 develop new products and services;
 invest in technology; and

 strategically acquire additional businesses and partner with other businesses in key sectors that will allow us to offer a broader array of products and services.

Our ability to compete successfully is also impacted by the growing availability of information from government information systems and other free sources, as well as competitors who aggressively market their products as a lower cost alternative. See “—Increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources that offer comparable value to customers may reduce demand for our products and services.” Because some of our competitors may be able to offer products and services that may be more cost effective than ours, including through the provision of price incentives for new customers, and because some of our competitors’ products and services may be seen as having greater functionality or performance than ours, the relative value of some of our products or services could be diminished. In addition, some of our competitors combine competing products with complementary products as packaged solutions, which could preempt use of our products or services. Competition from such free or lower cost sources may require us to reduce the price of some of our products and services (which may result in lower revenues) or make additional capital investments (which might result in lower profit margins). If we are unable or unwilling to reduce prices or make additional investments in the future, we may lose customers and our financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, implementation of annual price increases by us from time to time may also, in some cases, cause customers to use lower-cost competitors.

Changes in tax laws or regulations in the various tax jurisdictions to which we are subject that are applied adversely to us or our customers could increase the costs of our products and services and harm our business.

New income, sales, use, or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be enacted at any time. Those enactments could harm our domestic and international business operations and our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified, or applied adversely to us. These events could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines and/or penalties and interest for past amounts deemed to be due. If we raise our prices to offset the costs of these changes, existing and potential future paying customers may elect not to purchase our products and services in the future. Additionally, new, changed, modified, or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could increase our customers’ and our compliance, operating, and other costs, as well as the costs of our products and services. Further, these events could decrease the capital we have available to operate our business. Any or all of these events could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The application of U.S. federal, state, local, and international tax laws to services provided electronically is continually evolving. Existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be interpreted or applied adversely to us, possibly with retroactive effect, which could require us or our paying customers to pay additional tax amounts, as well as require us or our paying customers to pay fines or penalties, as well as interest for past amounts. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes due from our paying customers, we could be held liable for such costs, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations and harming our business.

As a company with international operations, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could harm our liquidity and results of operations. In addition, authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest, and penalties, and they could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us, any of which could harm us and our results of operations.

Information Technology and Data Risks

Cyberattacks, security, privacy, or data breaches or other security incidents that affect our networks or systems, or those of our service providers, involving our or our customers’ sensitive, personal, classified or confidential information could expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions, decrease trust in us

and our products and services, increase the risk of litigation and governmental investigation, and harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition.

Threats to network and data security are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Our products and services, as well as our servers and computer systems and those of third parties that we rely on in our operations could be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks. As such, we may be subject to risks inherent to companies that process personal data. An increasing number of organizations have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks.

We implement measures to protect sensitive and personal data in accordance with our contracts, data protection laws and consumer laws. However, we may be subject to data breaches involving factors beyond its control, including data breach incidents suffered by third parties with which we contract or interact. Any technical problems that may arise in connection with our data and systems, including those that are hosted by third-party providers, could result in interruptions to our business and operations or exposure to security vulnerabilities. These types of problems may be caused by a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, intentional or accidental human actions or omissions, software errors, malware, viruses, security attacks, fraud, spikes in customer usage and denial of service issues. From time to time, large third-party web hosting providers may experience outages or other problems that would result in their systems being offline and inaccessible, which could materially impact our business and operations.

The secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of critical customer and business information are vital to our operations and our business strategy, and although we devote significant resources to protecting such information and take what we believe to be reasonable and appropriate measures to protect sensitive information from compromises such as unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification or lack of availability, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Although we maintain, and are in the process of improving, internal access control mechanisms and other security measures to ensure secure and appropriate access to and storage and use of our sensitive, business, personal, financial or confidential information by anyone including our employees, contractors and consultants, these mechanisms may not be entirely effective or fully complied with internally. We may in the future identify data protection issues requiring remediation and updates to our data security measures and compliance functions. Any misappropriation of sensitive information could harm our relationship with customers and cause us to incur financial liability and reputational harm. If any person, including any of our employees, improperly breaches our network security or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates sensitive data, we could be subject to regulatory actions and significant fines or lawsuits for breaching contractual confidentiality or data protection provisions, which could result in negative publicity, legal liability, loss of customers and damage to our reputation.

Because the techniques used by an individual or a group to obtain unauthorized access, make unwarranted alteration to our data, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems are often complex, not easily recognizable and evasive, We may not be able to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative measures. Such individuals or groups may be able to circumvent our security measures (including, but not limited to, through the deployment of harmful phishing attacks, malware infection, ransomware, system intrusion, misuse of systems, website defacement, social engineering and denial of service attacks) and may improperly access or misappropriate confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information held by us or on our behalf , disrupt our operations, damage our computers, or otherwise damage our business. Although we have developed or deployed systems and processes that are designed to protect our servers, platform and data, including sensitive data, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be effective at all times. Our efforts may be hindered due to, for example:
 government surveillance, regulatory requirements or other external events;
 software bugs or other technical errors or issues;
 errors or misconduct of employees, contractors or others;
 the rapidly evolving threat landscape; and
 inadequate or failed internal processes or business practice.
 
While we are investing significant resources to protect against or remediate cybersecurity threats or breaches, or to mitigate the impact of any breaches or threats, we may still be subject to potential liability in connection therewith. Actual or perceived breaches of our security could subject us to regulatory investigations and orders, litigation, indemnity obligations, damages, penalties, fines and other costs in connection with actual and alleged contractual breaches,

violations of applicable laws and regulations and other liabilities. Any such incident could also materially damage our reputation and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We maintain errors, omissions, and cyber liability insurance policies covering certain security and privacy damages. However, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Any of the foregoing could subject us to fines, scrutiny and legal actions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We depend on third parties for data, information and other services, and our ability to serve our customers could be adversely impacted if such third parties fail to fulfill their obligations, if we are unable to effectively manage and minimize errors, failures, interruptions or delays caused by third parties or if our arrangements with them are terminated and suitable replacements cannot be found on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

Interruptions or delays in services from third parties, including providers of datasets relevant to our products, data center hosting facilities, internet infrastructure, cloud computing platform providers, and other hardware and software vendors, or our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of our services and harm its business.

We currently serve our customers through the use of third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers. Damage to, or failure of, these systems, or systems upon which they depend such as internet infrastructure, could cause interruptions in our services. We have occasionally experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future. Such interruptions may cause customers to terminate their subscriptions, and adversely affect our customer renewal and upgrade performance and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable.

We do not control the operation of third-party facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements, and litigation to stop, limit, or delay operation. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.

These hardware, software, data, and cloud computing systems may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software, or cloud computing systems could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license, and integrated into our services.

Technical problems or disruptions affecting customers’ access to our services, or the software, internal applications, databases, and network systems underlying our services, could damage our reputation and brands and lead to reduced demand for our products and services, lower revenues, and increased costs.

Our business, brands, reputation, and ability to attract and retain users and customers depend upon the satisfactory performance, reliability, and availability of our products and services, which in turn depend upon the availability of the internet and our service providers. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, software errors, physical or electronic break-ins, or malicious hacks or attacks on our systems (such as denial of service attacks), could affect the security and availability of our products and services on its websites and prevent or inhibit the ability of users to access our products and services. In addition, the software, internal applications, and systems underlying our products and services are complex and may not be error-free. We may encounter technical problems when it attempts to enhance its products, services and systems. Any inefficiencies, errors, or technical problems with our systems could reduce the quality of our products and services or interfere with our customers’ use of its products and services, which could reduce demand, lower our revenues, and increase our costs.

Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, security breaches, computer viruses, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical break-ins, earthquakes,

and similar events. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in damage to or failure of our systems. These risks may be heightened for operations at facilities outside of our direct control, and the majority of the communications, network, and computer hardware used to operate the cloud for our platforms are located at facilities maintained by Amazon, Google and Salesforce, among others, which we do not own or control.

Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock

Our Co-Founders hold shares of FiscalNote Class B Common Stock, entitled to twenty-five (25) votes per share, which limits or precludes other stockholders’ ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, the approval of certain employee compensation plans, the adoption of amendments to our organizational documents and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval.

Our Class B Common Stock have twenty-five (25) votes per share, and our Class A Common Stock have one vote per share. Mr. Tim Hwang, our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Gerald Yao, our Co-Founder, Chief Strategy Officer and Global Head of ESG (together our “Co-Founders”), together hold all of the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock, which represent approximately 6.3% our common stock as of December 31, 2022. Accordingly, where a majority or plurality vote is required, as applicable, Mr. Hwang holds approximately 53.8% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock and Mr. Yao holds approximately 8.9% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Therefore, our Co-Founders will be able to determine the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors (which requires only a plurality vote), amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. After the expiration of applicable lock-up requirements, our Co-Founders would cease to hold a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock if they disposed of shares of Class B Common Stock representing approximately 2.5% of our outstanding common stock, in transactions other than Permitted Transfers as defined in our certificate of incorporation (“Charter”), assuming no other issuances of either Class A or Class B Common Stock have occurred since Closing and prior to such dispositions. Our Co-Founders, individually or together, may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock. Any future issuance of Class B Common Stock may be dilutive to holders of Class A Common Stock. For information about our dual-class structure, see Note 10, Stockholders' Equity.
 
Our dual-class structure may negatively impact the stock trading price of our Class A Common Stock.

Our dual-class structure may result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A Common Stock or in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indexes. In July 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies with dual or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Under the foregoing policies, our dual-class capital structure would make it ineligible for inclusion in those indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track those indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies are subject to change and it is as of yet unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companies that are included. Because of our dual-class structure, we will likely be excluded from certain of these indexes and we cannot guarantee that certain other stock indexes will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A Common Stock less attractive to other investors. Additionally, the holding of low-voting stock, such as our Class A Common Stock, may not be permitted by the investment policies of certain institutional investors or may be less attractive to the portfolio managers of certain institutional investors. As a result, the market price or liquidity of our Class A Common Stock could be adversely affected.


We are a “controlled company” under NYSE rules, and as a result, our stockholders may not have certain corporate protections that are available to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.

As a result of our dual-class structure, our Co-Founders control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock therefore we are a "controlled company" under NYSE rules. As a controlled company, we are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements, including those that would otherwise require our board of directors (“Board”) to have a majority of independent directors and its compensation and nominating and governance committees to be comprised entirely of independent directors, have written charters addressing such committee’s purpose and responsibilities and perform an annual evaluation of such committee. While we do not presently intend to rely on these exemptions, we may opt to utilize these exemptions in the future as long as we remain a controlled company. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.

Sales of a substantial number of our Class A Common Stock into the public market or the perception that such sales might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock into the public market or the perception that such sales might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline and may make it more difficult for you to sell your Class A Common Stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.

As of January 29, 2023, approximately 87.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock were released from the lock-up periods imposed in connection with the Business Combination, with approximately 11.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock still subject to lock-up until July 29, 2023. Sales of our common stock following the expiration of the lock-up periods or pursuant to exercise of registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales also could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.
 
The Warrants may never be in the money, and may expire worthless.

The effective exercise price of the Warrants is $7.32 per share. We believe the likelihood that warrant holders will exercise the Warrants, and therefore the amount of cash proceeds that we would receive, is dependent upon the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. If the trading price for our shares of Class A Common Stock is less than $7.32 per share, we believe holders of the Warrants will be unlikely to exercise their Warrants. On December 31, 2022, the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the NYSE was $6.33 per share. There is no guarantee that the Warrants will be in the money following the time they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, and as such, the Warrants may expire worthless and we may receive no proceeds from the exercise of the Warrants.

We will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.

We became a public company following the consummation of the Business Combination, and as such (and particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company”), will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that Legacy FiscalNote did not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the listing standards of the NYSE, including changes in corporate governance practices and the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls. Compliance with these rules and regulations can be burdensome. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our historical legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly, such as attracting and retaining qualified members of our Board as compared to Legacy FiscalNote as a private company.

We may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff or engage outside consultants with public company experience and technical accounting knowledge, and maintain an internal audit function, which will increase our operating

expenses. Moreover, we could incur additional compensation costs if we decide to pay cash compensation comparable to other publicly-listed companies, which would increase our general and administrative expenses and could adversely affect our profitability. We are evaluating these rules and regulations and related matters, and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.

If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade their recommendations regarding our Class A Common Stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.

The trading market for our Class A Common Stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about it or its business. We do not control these analysts. If any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Class A Common Stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our Class A Common Stock may decline. If analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the price or trading volume of our Class A Common Stock to decline and our Class A Common Stock to be less liquid.

Should the price or trading volume of our Class A Common Stock decline, it could indicate an impairment of our assets.
 
We may issue preferred stock, the terms of which could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A Common Stock.
 
Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of its stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations, and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A Common Stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A Common Stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our Class A Common Stock.

We do not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.

We likely will continue to operate at a loss in the foreseeable future, and will retain most, if not all, of its available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, we do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Our Board has discretion as to whether to distribute dividends. Even if the Board decides to declare and pay dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on the future results of operations and cash flow, capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by us from subsidiaries, our financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. Accordingly, you may need to rely on sales of our Class A Common Stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on your investment. However, our Class A Common Stock may not appreciate in value or the market price thereof may decline.

Our Charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by its stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or other stockholders.

Our Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on its behalf, (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or any other wrongdoing by, any of our current or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder (iii) action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our Charter or our Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery, (iv) action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of any provisions of our Charter or our Bylaws, or (v) action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court does not have jurisdiction thereof, the federal district court or other state courts of the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any action, suit

or proceeding asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, and the foregoing exclusive forum provisions of our Charter will not apply to claims arising under the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws for which there is exclusive federal jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provision in our Charter.

This choice-of-forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a different judicial forum, including one that it may find favorable or convenient for a specified class of disputes with us or our directors, officers, other stockholders, or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our Charter inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and Board.
