Competition
Parker operates in highly competitive markets and industries. We offer our products over numerous, varied markets through our divisions operating in 50 countries. Our global scope means that we have hundreds of competitors across our various markets and product offerings. Our competitors include U.S. and non-U.S. companies. These competitors and the degree of competition vary widely by product lines, end markets, geographic scope and/or geographic locations. Although each of our segments has numerous competitors, given our market and product breadth, no single competitor competes with the Company with respect to all the products we manufacture and sell.
In the Diversified Industrial Segment, Parker competes on the basis of product quality and innovation, customer service, manufacturing and distribution capability, and price competitiveness. We believe that we are one of the market leaders in most of the major markets for our most significant Diversified Industrial Segment products. We have comprehensive motion and control packages for the broadest systems capabilities. While our primary global competitors include Bosch Rexroth AG, Danaher Corporation, Danfoss A/S, Donaldson Company, Inc., Eaton Corporation plc, Emerson Climate Technologies, Inc., Emerson/ASCO, Festo AG & Co., Freudenberg-NOK, Gates Corporation, IMI/Norgren, SMC Corporation, Swagelok Company, and Trelleborg AB, none of these businesses compete with every group or product in our Diversified Industrial Segment.
In the Aerospace Systems Segment, we have developed alliances with key customers based on our advanced technological and engineering capabilities, superior performance in quality, delivery, and service, and price competitiveness. This has enabled us to obtain significant original equipment business on new aircraft programs for our systems and components as well as the follow-on repair and replacement business for these programs. Further, the Aerospace Systems Segment utilizes low-cost manufacturing techniques and best cost region strategies to achieve a lower cost producer status. Although we believe that we are one of the market leaders in most of the major markets for our most significant Aerospace Systems Segment products, primary global competitors for these products include Eaton Corporation plc, Honeywell International, Inc., Moog Inc., Triumph Group, Inc., UTC Collins Aerospace, Woodward, Inc. and Safran S.A.
We believe that our platform utilizing eight core technologies, which consist of electromechanical, filtration, fluid handling, hydraulics, pneumatics, process control, refrigeration, and sealing and shielding, is a positive factor in our ability to compete effectively with both large and small competitors. For both of our segments, we believe that the following factors also contribute to our ability to compete effectively:

• | decentralized business model;


• | technology breadth and interconnectivity;


• | engineered products with intellectual property;


• | long product life cycles;


• | balanced OEM vs. aftermarket;


• | low capital investment requirements; and


• | great generators and delployers of cash over the cycle.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses
We own a number of patents, trademarks, copyrights and licenses related to our products. We also have exclusive and non-exclusive rights to use patents, trademarks and copyrights owned by others. In addition, patent and trademark applications are pending, although there can be no assurance that further patents and trademarks will be issued. We do not depend on any single patent, trademark, copyright or license or group of patents, trademarks, copyrights or licenses to any material extent.
Backlog and Seasonal Nature of Business
Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale. Our backlog by business segment for the past two years is included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference. Our backlog was $4.2 billion at June 30, 2019 and $4.1 billion at June 30, 2018. Approximately 90 percent of our backlog at June 30, 2019 is scheduled for delivery in the succeeding twelve months. Because of the breadth and global scope of our business, our overall business is generally not seasonal in nature.
Environmental Regulation
Certain of our operations require the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, the Company is subject to United States federal, state, and local laws and regulations as well as non-U.S. laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damage and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or exposures to, hazardous materials. Among other environmental laws, we are subject to the United States federal "Superfund" law, under which we have been designated as a "potentially responsible party" and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund priority list.
As of June 30, 2019, Parker was involved in environmental remediation at various U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturing facilities presently or formerly operated by us and as a "potentially responsible party," along with other companies, at off-site waste disposal facilities and regional sites.
We believe that our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and the consequent financial liability to the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management efforts and expenditures by the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had in the past, and, we believe, will not have in the future, a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
Our reserve for environmental matters is discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Energy Matters and Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Our primary energy source for both of our business segments is electric power. While we cannot predict future costs of electric power, the primary source for production of the required electric power is expected to be coal and natural gas from coal and natural gas reserves available to electric utilities. We are subject to governmental regulations in regard to energy supplies in the United States and elsewhere. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions of our operations due to energy curtailments.
We primarily use steel, brass, copper, aluminum, nickel, rubber and thermoplastic materials and chemicals as the principal raw materials in our products. We expect these materials to be available from numerous sources in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements.
Employees
We employ approximately 55,610 persons as of June 30, 2019, of whom approximately 28,500 were employed by foreign subsidiaries.
Acquisitions
The Company made no material acquisitions in 2019. During 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we expect to acquire LORD Corporation ("Lord"). The proposed Lord acquisition and prior-year acquisitions are discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference. On July 29, 2019, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire EMFCO Holdings Incorporated, parent company of Exotic Metals Forming Company LLC ("Exotic"). The proposed Exotic acquisition is discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
