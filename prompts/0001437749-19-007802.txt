COMPANY OVERVIEW
 
Windtree Therapeutics, Inc. (referred to as “we,” “us,” or the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation, with our principal offices located at 2600 Kelly Road, Suite 100, Warrington, Pennsylvania. We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1992. Our telephone number is 215-488-9300 and our corporate website address is www.windtreetx.com. Our common stock is currently traded on The OTCQB® Venture Market (OTCQB) quotation system operated by The OTC Markets Group Inc., and our symbol is WINT.
 
We are a biotechnology and medical device company focused on developing drug product candidates and medical device technologies to address acute pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. Historically, our focus has been on the development of our proprietary KL4 surfactant technology and aerosol delivery system (ADS) technology for the treatment and or prevention of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants.  Following our merger with CVie Investments in December 2018 (discussed below), we are also focusing on therapies for acute heart failure and hypertension and associated organ dysfunction. 
 
Our four lead development programs are (1) istaroxime for treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), (2) AEROSURF® (lucinactant for inhalation) for non-invasive delivery of our lyophilized KL4 surfactant to treat RDS in premature infants, (3) lyophilized KL4 surfactant intratracheal suspension for RDS, and (4) rostafuroxin for genetically associated hypertension. 
 
Heart failure is a chronic, progressive condition in which patients often experience episodic periods of increased symptoms called ADHF, where the heart fails to adequately pump, resulting in worsening symptoms, including pulmonary and peripheral edema and other severe complications.  In the US, nearly 6 million people (nearly two percent of the adult population) have heart failure and approximately half of these patients are expected to die within 5 years of diagnosis; and in the combined US, EU and Japan markets, there are over 14 million patients with heart failure.  ADHF can be precipitated by many factors and puts patients at increased risk for morbidity, hospital readmission and mortality.  Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients age 65 years and older.  There are more than 1.1 million hospital admissions for heart failure in the US each year and over 2.5 million hospital estimated admissions for ADHF in the combined US, EU and Japan markets.  We estimate that ADHF may represent a potential addressable market of approximately $1.6 billion dollars annually (in the US, EU and Japan). Based on preclinical and clinical studies performed to date, we believe that istaroxime, if approved, may have the potential to address unmet medical needs of these patients by improving cardiac function and management of fluid accumulation that contributes to heart failure symptoms while potentially avoiding complications associated with current ADHF therapies.  We are also focused on early development of oral and other intravenous therapies to potentially address both acute and chronic heart failure. In addition to the ADHF market, GlobalData has estimated that the sales market for chronic heart failure therapies in the base year (2016) totaled $3.6 billion within the seven major markets, with the US contributing just over 70% of these sales.
 
Surfactants are produced naturally in the lung and are essential for normal respiratory function and survival.  RDS is a condition that occurs in premature infants who may not have fully-developed natural lung surfactant and may require surfactant therapy to sustain life.  RDS is the most prevalent respiratory disease in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).  RDS can result in long-term respiratory problems, developmental delays and death. We believe that the current surfactant market for RDS is estimated to be approximately $70 to $90 million annually in the US and approximately $400 to $425 million annually worldwide. We believe that this market has been constrained because surfactants are generally administered using intubation, frequently with mechanical ventilation, two invasive procedures that may result in serious respiratory and non-respiratory complications.  By contrast, AEROSURF is a combination drug/device product that is designed to administer our KL4 surfactant noninvasively and, we believe, may avoid these invasive procedures and achieve a competitively advantageous position in an expanding RDS market.  We also believe that AEROSURF may support an expansion of the RDS surfactant market by reducing the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation, reducing hospital costs, and enabling dosing and repeat dosing as needed using noninvasive delivery of AEROSURF via nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP).  Moreover, while the current surfactant market represents drug-only revenues, we plan to capture revenues from the drug product and the ADS disposable cartridges, supported by anticipated pharmacoeconomic benefits associated with the successful use of nCPAP. As such, we believe that AEROSURF, if approved, may be administered in less specialized hospitals and birthing centers, potentially further expanding access to treatment and potentially achieving a higher price per patient in an addressable market that could be in excess of $1 billion annually. In addition, we are assessing a potential development plan potentially to gain regulatory approval for our lyophilized KL4 surfactant as an intratracheal suspension for RDS, which would allow us to make our KL4 surfactant available in an expanded market to treat the smallest infants and those who are unable to breathe on their own and may not be good candidates for AEROSURF.

Our fourth product candidate is rostafuroxin for the treatment of hypertension associated with certain patient genotypes. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), patients with high blood pressure have a greater risk for heart disease and stroke, which are the leading causes of death in the US. Currently, an estimated 75 million adults, or approximately one third of the adult population in the US, have high blood pressure and the incidence is increasing. During 2014, high blood pressure was a primary or contributing cause of death for more than 410,000 adults in the US. The estimated annual cost of high blood pressure in the US, including for health care services, medications, and missed days of work, is approximately $48.6 billion. Unfortunately, hypertension is a heterogeneous disease in which a majority of treated patients (50-85% globally) do not reach their therapeutic target blood pressure and patients often have persistent hypertension despite being on multiple therapies. Ethnicity and genetic makeup are known to impact the response to anti-hypertensive treatments, and uncontrolled hypertension has been associated with certain genetic makeups. We believe, based on preclinical and clinical studies performed to date, that rostafuroxin may potentially reduce or normalize blood pressure and may address unmet medical needs in a genetically identified subset of patients that could represent approximately 20% - 25% of patients with hypertension. Given the size of the market and the prevalence of unmet medical needs, major pharmaceutical companies have maintained hypertension as a key area of focus and continue to seek new drugs to compete in markets they have established with previous anti-hypertensive therapies. We plan to develop rostafuroxin and potentially leverage the industry’s interest in licensing opportunities in this market.
 
ISTAROXIME
 
Overview
 
Our lead cardiovascular product is istaroxime, an investigational drug that we are developing to treat acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF).  Heart failure can result from structural or functional cardiac abnormalities. Heart failure is a chronic, progressive disease that commonly but episodically worsens to a point of decompensation, where cardiac output fails to meet the body’s metabolic needs. The disease is characterized by inadequate pumping function of the heart that results in fluid accumulation manifesting as pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema and congestion in other parts of the body. Insufficient cardiac output can result in inadequate peripheral perfusion that increases the risk of other organ dysfunction such as renal failure. Chronic heart failure is commonly treated with multiple medications including diuretics, inhibitors of neurohumoral imbalances (angiotensin, renin, aldosterone, naturetic peptides) and beta blockers. Effective treatments for ADHF are lacking.
 
Intensification of heart failure therapy in the hospital typically includes intravenous diuretics and, if the blood pressure is low, supportive therapy with inotropes. Inotropes can be associated with adverse effects that include hypotension, arrhythmias and possibly increased mortality. These drugs are used only if needed to support blood pressure and cardiac function.
 
Istaroxime represents a novel approach to the treatment of ADHF. It has a dual mechanism of action referred to as luso-inotropic, to improve cardiovascular physiology. First, it activates the SERCA2a calcium pump on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) leading to enhanced SR calcium uptake and a reduction in cytoplasmic calcium that allows for improved myocardial relaxation (lusitropic). Second, it inhibits the sodium-potassium ATPase activity leading to improved myocardial contractility (inotropic). We believe that this mechanism of action may result in improvement in cardiac function and perfusion to reduce congestion and edema and preserve other organ function while avoiding the side effects associated with other classes of heart failure therapies.  Preclinical and clinical studies performed to date suggest that istaroxime may improve cardiovascular physiology as assessed by parameters of pump function, decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, decreases in heart rate, increases in blood pressure without adverse events such as arrhythmias, cardiac damage (as indicated by elevated troponin values) or adverse impact on kidney function. We believe that these features of istaroxime, if approved, could potentially result in clinical improvement of patients' heart failure symptoms and reduce both complications and length of hospital stays when compared to current therapeutic regimens for ADHF.
 
In 2007, CVie Therapeutics completed a phase 2a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation clinical trial that was designed to evaluate 3 doses of istaroxime in a study of 120 hospitalized patients (~30 patients per cohort) with ADHF and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with 3 doses of istaroxime administered over a 6-hour infusion period.  The primary endpoint, lowering of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) was significantly improved in all 3 doses relative to placebo, and the certain secondary hemodynamic endpoints (increased systolic blood pressure and decreased heart rate) also improved.  The main side effects were vomiting (7.9%) and pain at the infusion site (5.6%); one severe adverse event of ventricular tachycardia was observed.  The favorable effects on PCWP, blood pressure and heart rate with potential luso-inotropic effects provided the basis for moving the program forward into a phase clinical 2b trial and for selecting the doses to study.
 
In January 2019, we announced topline results of a phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation clinical trial, a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 120 hospitalized patients in Europe and Asia with ADHF that was designed to evaluate two doses of istaroxime administered over a 24-hour infusion period (~ 40 patients per dose group).  The primary endpoint, E/Ea, (reflecting change in PCWP or left ventricle filling pressure) measured by echocardiography utilizing a single, central core laboratory, was significantly (p<0.05) improved by both doses of istaroxime. Stroke volume was substantially increased as well.  There were no signs of increased risk for arrhythmias or increased troponin levels (a marker of heart muscle damage) during or after istaroxime infusion. Additionally, blood pressure tended to increase, and heart rate decrease, during the infusion. The most common adverse events were vomiting (2.4% and 25%) and infusion site pain (32% and 30%) in the 0.5 and 1.0 µg/kg/min groups, respectively.  This study confirmed the physiologic improvements seen in the phase 2a study and replicates the effects of istaroxime in ADHF.

AEROSURF

Overview
 
One of our lead development programs is AEROSURF® (lucinactant for inhalation), an investigational combination drug/device product that we are developing to improve the management of RDS in premature infants who may not have fully developed natural lung surfactant and may require surfactant therapy to sustain life.  Surfactant therapy can be a life-saving treatment for RDS and is the primary therapy to address an underlying surfactant deficiency. Unfortunately, surfactants currently available in the US are animal-derived and are generally administered using invasive endotracheal intubation, frequently with mechanical ventilation, procedures that may result in serious respiratory conditions and other complications.  AEROSURF is designed to deliver aerosolized KL4 surfactant noninvasively using our proprietary ADS technology and potentially may meaningfully reduce the use of invasive endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. We believe that AEROSURF, if approved, has the potential to reduce the number of premature infants who are subjected to invasive surfactant administration, and potentially provide transformative clinical and pharmacoeconomic benefits.  The FDA has granted Fast Track designation for our KL4 surfactant (including AEROSURF) to treat RDS.
 
We have filed an investigational new drug application (IND) with the FDA for AEROSURF for the treatment of RDS in premature infants and have completed three AEROSURF phase 2 clinical trials. All three clinical trials assessed the safety and tolerability of AEROSURF and suggested evidence of a beneficial treatment effect when the treatment is delivered as intended.
 
In June 2017, we announced that we had completed enrollment in our AEROSURF phase 2b clinical trial, a multicenter, randomized, controlled study with masked treatment assignment in 221 premature infants that was designed to evaluate aerosolized KL4 surfactant administered to premature infants 26 to 32 week gestational age receiving nCPAP, in two dose groups (25 and 50 minutes) with up to two potential repeat doses, compared to infants receiving nCPAP alone. This trial was conducted in approximately 50 clinical sites in the US, Canada, Europe and Latin America.
 
In this phase 2b clinical trial, based on the planned top-line results, AEROSURF did not meet the primary endpoint of a reduction in nCPAP failure at 72 hours. We believe this result was attributable in large part to an unexpected rate of treatment interruptions, which occurred in about 24% of active enrollments, predominantly in the 50-minute dose group. These interruptions, we believe, were primarily related to specific lots of disposable cartridge filters with a higher tendency to clog. After excluding patients in the 50-minute dose group whose dose was interrupted, in accordance with the predesignated statistical plan, nCPAP failure rates were 44% in the control group (n=71) compared to 32% (n=44) in the AEROSURF 50-minute dose group, which is a 12% absolute reduction or a 27% relative reduction in nCPAP failure compared to control. These data suggest a meaningful treatment effect in line with our desired targeted outcome. The overall data suggest that the safety and tolerability profile of AEROSURF was generally comparable to the control group. Reported adverse events and serious adverse events were those that are common and expected among premature infants with RDS and comparable to the control group. As expected, some peridosing events occurred (e.g., changes in oxygen requirements and blood pressure in the time around dosing) more commonly in the AEROSURF groups, however, these were transient in nature and occurred less frequently than seen in intratracheal administration.
 
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease of premature infants who have required intubation, mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. BPD is associated with ongoing pulmonary disease and neurodevelopmental impairment that contributes to substantial patient morbidity. This is associated with increased health care utilization and higher healthcare costs. Notwithstanding, effective prevention and treatment strategies for BPD have been elusive and there is no approved treatment. In the post hoc pooled analysis of the AEROSURF phase 2b clinical trial and phase 2a clinical trial in infants 26-28 weeks gestational age, AEROSURF treatment was associated with significantly lowered incidence and severity of BPD compared to infants on nCPAP alone. This effect was observed without excluding patients whose treatment was interrupted.
 
In 2018, we transitioned from our prototype 2 ADS used in the phase 2 clinical program (phase 2 ADS) to a newly-designed ADS for use in our phase 3 program (phase 3 ADS), which combines the same aerosolization technology used during the phase 2 clinical program, but with improved ergonomics, interface, controls, and dose monitoring in a modular design. We successfully concluded design verification activities through a detailed assessment of the phase 3 ADS design and implemented design changes to potentially mitigate the risks of device-related treatment interruptions experienced in the prototype phase 2 device used in the phase 2b clinical trial. We believe that the phase 3 ADS will be easier and faster to use and may support enhanced clinical outcomes by potentially allowing for reduced time to initial administration of our KL4 surfactant and reduced time intervals between doses, if required.

With respect to our ADS, we are currently engaged in a technology transfer of our device manufacturing process from Battelle Memorial Institute (Battelle) to Mack Molding Company (Mack), an FDA-registered medical device manufacturer that we have engaged to produce a new phase 3 ADS for use in our planned AEROSURF bridging study and potentially address the unexpected rate of treatment interruptions (we previously referred to this new version as the NextGen ADS). If AEROSURF is approved for marketing, we expect that the phase 3 ADS will also support our commercial market platform. We currently have a Memorandum of Understanding with Mack to cover this transfer.
 
Focus for 2019 – AEROSURF Bridging Study
 
We are planning to conduct an additional AEROSURF clinical bridging study that is designed among other things, to clinically evaluate the design and performance of our new phase 3 ADS. This trial will not be powered to establish statistical significance but will generate additional higher dose treatment data to augment the higher dose data obtained in the phase 2b clinical trial.  Our plans include a multicenter, randomized, controlled study with masked treatment assignment in approximately 70 premature infants that is designed to assess safety and tolerability of administering aerosolized KL4 surfactant administered to premature infants 26 to 32 week gestational age receiving nCPAP in an extended initial dose (consisting of two 50 minute-doses) with up to 3 repeat doses (each 50-minutes, administered with a minimum of 20 minutes between doses) compared to infants receiving nCPAP alone. In addition to assessing safety and tolerability, the key objectives of this trial include assessing nCPAP failure rates at 72 hours and 28 days and the performance of the phase 3 ADS. We plan to conduct this trial in 15 to 25 of our previous phase 2b, higher-performing clinical sites. We anticipate that this trial will start late in the third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2019; however, we will require additional capital to be in a position to complete the trial in accordance with our development plan, (see, Item 1A – Risk Factors – Risks Related to Capital Resource Requirements).
 
Other 
 
We have contracted with Clinical Supplies Management, Inc. for the receipt, labeling, packaging and distribution of drug and materials to support our planned AEROSURF bridging study. 
 
Our lyophilized KL4 surfactant is manufactured for us by Pharma Services Group, Patheon, part of Thermo Fisher Scientific (Patheon), under a development agreement providing for development and manufacture of our drug product through completion of process validation which will be completed during the manufacture of drug product to complete the planned phase 3 clinical program.
 
In our Warrington laboratory we conduct certain analytical and quality control activities including release testing of all API’s and release and stability testing of our lyophilized and aerosolized KL4 surfactant drug product. We also work with a number of third-party institutions and laboratories that perform various studies as well as quality control release and stability testing.
 
KL4 surfactant is comprised of four active pharmaceutical ingredients (API’s). Our API suppliers are Bachem Americas, Inc., Corden Pharma and Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. We have supply agreements for KL4 and POPG and source the other two under purchase orders.  With respect to KL4, we received a notice of nonrenewal from Bachem in connection with an expiration date in June 2019.  We are working to develop a new manufacturing process and will select a successor based on request-for-proposal submissions.  To provide a sufficient supply of KL4 to support our AEROSURF development plan through the planned phase 3 clinical program, we are manufacturing an inventory of KL4 with Bachem.
 
Lyophilized KL4 Surfactant – Other Studies
 
We are assessing potential development pathways to secure marketing approval for lyophilized KL4 surfactant as an intratracheal instillate for the treatment and/or prevention of RDS. Lyophilized KL4 surfactant is the drug product component of AEROSURF and a lyophilized (freeze-dried) dosage form of the liquid KL4 surfactant intratracheal instillate (SURFAXIN®) that was approved by the FDA in 2012. In April 2015, we voluntarily ceased commercializing SURFAXIN to focus our resources on the development of aerosolized KL4 surfactant for respiratory diseases, beginning with AEROSURF.
 
Our KL4 surfactant can be lyophilized (freeze-dried) and reconstituted to a liquid just prior to administration. We currently maintain continuous cold chain storage for this product. We plan to conduct studies to assess potential reduction of cold chain storage and refrigeration requirements in the hospital. We have demonstrated in laboratory experiments that our lyophilized KL4 surfactant retains many of the key attributes and characteristics of our liquid instillate. We previously discussed with the FDA a potential development plan, trial design and regulatory plan for approval and plan potentially to re-engage with the FDA in the second half of 2019. If we can define an acceptable development program that is achievable from a cost, timing and resource perspective, we may seek approval to treat premature infants who, because they are unable to breathe on their own or other reason, are not candidates for AEROSURF.

In addition, on March 12, 2018, we announced a collaboration with Eleison Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical company developing life-saving therapeutics for rare cancers, to assess the feasibility of using our ADS potentially to deliver Eleison’s inhaled lipid cisplatin (ILC), potentially in combination with our KL4 surfactant.  Eleison is developing ILC for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and completed a phase II study of ILC in patients with bone cancer (osteosarcoma) metastatic to the lung. 
 
We believe our lyophilized KL4 surfactant and ADS technologies may potentially support a product pipeline to address a broad range of serious respiratory conditions in children and adults.  We have received support, and plan to seek additional support, from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other government funding sources to explore the utility of our KL4 surfactant to address a variety of such respiratory conditions as acute lung injury (ALI), including acute radiation exposure to the lung (acute pneumonitis and delayed lung injury), chemical-induced ALI, and influenza-induced ALI; as well as chronic rhinosinusitis, complications of certain major surgeries, mechanical ventilator-induced lung injury (often referred to as VILI), pneumonia, and diseases involving mucociliary clearance disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis (CF).
 
Rostafuroxin
 
Overview
 
Rostafuroxin is a novel investigational drug product candidate that is designed to be a selective antagonist of adducin polymorphisms and endogenous ouabain, both known triggers of hypertension, and creates functional effects by enhancing renal tubular sodium reabsorption and increasing vascular tone. Rostafuroxin targets resistant hypertensive patients with a specific genetic profile, which is found in approximately 20% – 25% of the adult hypertensive population. Based on the preclinical and clinical studies performed to date, we believe that rostafuroxin may reduce or normalize blood pressure in this genetically identified subset of patients and may reduce the risk of hypertension-related sequelae beyond the level normally associated with the absolute reduction of blood pressure, per se, because the molecular mechanism blocked by rostafuroxin may also be involved in organ damage.
 
CVie Therapeutics conducted three phase 2 clinical trials assessing reduction in blood pressure when rostafuroxin is administered in a hypertensive population selected in accordance with a specified genetic profile. A phase 2b clinical trial was conducted as a two-part study with the first part conducted in Italy with Caucasian patients and the second part conducted in Taiwan with ethnic Chinese patients. The efficacy results in Italy were positive in both this trial and in an earlier phase 2a clinical trial; however, the blood pressure response in Chinese patients in the second part of the phase 2b study was minimal.
 
We are analyzing the results of these clinical trials potentially to identify the reasons for the limited response in Chinese patients, including with respect to potential differences between the populations in drug metabolism, bioavailability or drug interaction with traditional Chinese medicines that the patients may have been taking to manage their hypertension.
 
Focus for 2019
 
In 2019, we plan to focus on finalizing the drug formulation and defining drug product analytical methods supporting release and stability measures and assessments. Once we have developed a product profile, we plan to seek opportunities to out-license rostafuroxin to a larger company that has interest in and/or operates in the very large and broad antihypertension market.

The drug product for rostafuroxin is manufactured by Doppel Farmaceutici S.r.l. The API used in the manufacture of rostafuroxin is manufactured by China Gateway Pharmaceutical Development Co., Ltd.
 
acquisition of Cvie therapeutics and 
 private placement financing
 
CVie Acquisition 
 
On December 21, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (CVie Acquisition) with, and thereby acquired, CVie Investments Limited (CVie Investments), an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands.  Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, we issued shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (common stock) to CVie Investments’ former shareholders, at an exchange ratio of 0.3512 share of common stock for each share of CVie Investments outstanding prior to the merger, resulting in the issuance of 16,265,060 shares of common stock being issued in exchange for the shares of CVie Investments. The merger closed on December 21, 2018.
 
In connection with the CVie Acquisition, we entered into an indemnity agreement with Lee’s Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited (Lee’s), pursuant to which Lee’s agreed to indemnify our shareholders and holders of certain warrants of record on December 20, 2018 (the Indemnitees) for one year for any loss, liability, damage or expense incurred by us in connection with or, as a result of, any material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by CVie Therapeutics in the Acquisition Agreement. To secure its performance under the indemnity agreement, 984,000 shares of common stock issued to a Lee’s affiliate in the merger were placed in escrow with our transfer agent. A portion of the escrowed shares will be transferred to the Indemnitees as the sole and exclusive remedy for a successful indemnity claim.
 
Since the closing, we have operated CVie Investments, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, CVie Therapeutics Ltd., (CVie Therapeutics) a Taiwan corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of China, as a business division (the entities may be collectively referred to in this Form 10-K as CVie) focused on early development of drug product candidates for cardiovascular diseases. We undertook the merger as part of a strategic initiative to create stockholder value that resulted from a multi-year process focused on identifying strategic opportunities, including potential strategic alliances, collaborations (primarily outside the United States (US)), joint development opportunities, acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, as well as potential combinations (including by merger or acquisition) or other corporate transactions. In connection with the merger, we declared a dividend to the holders of record of outstanding shares of common stock, and holders of certain warrants to purchase common stock, that were outstanding on December 20, 2018 of 0.6148 Series H AEROSURF Warrant, for each share of common stock held by a shareholder or each warrant held by a warrant holder, as applicable, on the record date (the AEROSURF Warrants). We distributed AEROSURF Warrants that are exercisable for an aggregate of approximately 2.96 million shares of common stock. Each AEROSURF Warrant has a term of five years and provides for automatic exercise into one share of common stock, without any exercise price, upon our public announcement of the dosing of the first human subject enrolled in a phase 3 clinical trial for AEROSURF.

Private Placement Financing
 
On December 21, 2018, we also completed a private placement offering with select institutional investors (Investors) for the purchase of an aggregate of 11,785,540 shares of common stock at a price per share of $3.3132, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $39.0 million (Private Placement Financing). Included in the purchase price, each of LPH II Investments Limited (LPH II), an affiliate of Lee’s, and Battelle Memorial Institute converted $6.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of existing debt obligations on the same terms as the other Investors. In connection with this financing, we issued (i) Series F Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,003,541 shares of common stock, at an exercise price equal to $3.68 per share, which are exercisable through the 18-month anniversary of the date of issuance (the Series F Warrants), and (ii) Series G Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,889,229 shares of common stock, at an exercise price equal to $4.05 per share, which are exercisable through the 5-year anniversary of the date of issuance (the Series G Warrants and, together with the Series F Warrants, the December 2018 Warrants). The December 2018 Warrants (i) may not be exercised to the extent that, following such exercise, the holder would beneficially own more than 9.99% (or other percent as designated by each holder) of our outstanding shares of common stock, and (ii) otherwise contain customary provisions that adjust the exercise price and the number of shares of common stock into which they may be exercised in the event of a corporate transaction.
LEE’S PHARMACEUTICAL HOLDINGS LIMITED AND AFFILIATES
 
During the period of this report, we have received substantial support from Lees, our largest shareholder. Lee’s is a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability, whose common stock is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and which along with its affiliates currently owns approximately 40% of our issued and outstanding common stock.
 
In February 2017, Lee’s invested $2.0 million in our $10.5 million private placement offering of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Units at a purchase price per unit of $1,495 per unit.  In June 2017, we entered into an exclusive License Agreement with an affiliate of Lee’s for the development and commercialization of KL4 surfactant products in China, Hong Kong and other select Asian markets (see, – Licensing, Patents, and Other Proprietary Rights and Regulatory Designations – Licensing – Lee’s Pharmaceutical (HK) Ltd.
 
In October 27, 2017, LPH Investments Limited, an affiliate of Lee’s, purchased $10 million of our common stock, resulting in Lee’s controlling a 73% interest in our common stock (this transaction included cancellation of $3.9 million in loans advanced by Lee’s (HK) to sustain our operations while we negotiated the purchase agreement).  In April 2018, LPH II Investments Limited purchased $2.6 million of our common stock and warrants at a purchase price of $4.80.
 
Throughout the period of this report, Lee’s also supported our development activities and operations with loans made through certain subsidiaries as follow: August 2017, $3.9 million loaned by Lee’s (HK); January and March 2018, $1.5 million and $1 million, respectively, loaned by LPH; on August 14, August 29, September 12, September 27, October 19, November 2, and November 19, 2018, $0.3 million, $0.48 million, $0.5 million, $0.5 million, $0.43 million, $0.5 million, and $0.35 million, respectively, loaned by LPH; and on December 5, 2018, $.6 million, loaned by LPH II, to support our development activities and operations while we pursued our potential strategic transaction with CVie Therapeutics.  The loans accrued interest at a rate per annum of 6% and were collateralized by a security interest in substantially all our assets under a March 2018 Security Agreement.
 
During 2018, we engaged in active diligence and discussions with CVie Therapeutics Limited, a Taiwan corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of China, to potentially conclude a strategic transaction.  At that time, Lee’s owned approximately 49% of the outstanding capital stock of CVie Therapeutics, but because of the potential conflict of interest, did not participate in the negotiations and agreed to be bound by the terms otherwise reached between ourselves and CVie Therapeutics, which was represented by James Huang, an independent director.  To facilitate the transaction, Lee’s committed to maintain in place collateral previously pledged to secure CVie’s O-Bank loan and agreed to provide the indemnity agreement to protect our shareholders and holders of certain warrants, as discussed above.
 
We plan to continue to partner with Lee’s and look forward to the development of our KL4 surfactant products in the Asian market under our license agreement and, in the future, potentially other of our product candidates.  However, we have no written commitments from Lee’s for future transactions and there can be no assurance that Lee’s will continue to work with us in the future.
 
Strategic Alliances and Collaboration Arrangements
 
Battelle Collaboration Agreement
 
In October 2014, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Battelle for the development of our phase 3 ADS. We had previously worked with Battelle, which has expertise in developing and integrating aerosol devices using innovative and advanced technologies, in connection with development of our prototype phase 2 ADS used in the AEROSURF phase 2b clinical trial. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we and Battelle shared the costs of development for a three-stage development plan that included (i) defining the requirements and a detailed project plan for a phase 3 ADS, (ii) executing the project plan, and (iii) completing required testing, verification and documentation, putting us in a position to manufacture a phase 3 ADS for use in the remaining AEROSURF development activities and, if approved, the initial commercial activities. We retained final decision-making authority over all matters related to the design, registration, manufacture, packaging, marketing, distribution and sale of the phase 3 ADS. We and Battelle shared equally the costs of the first stage and the planned costs of the remaining two stages. Battelle agreed to bear the cost of any cost overruns associated with the project plan and we agreed to bear the cost of any increase in cost resulting from changes in the scope of the product requirements. We also agreed that, if Battelle successfully completed the project plan in a timely manner, we would pay Battelle royalties equal to a low single-digit percentage of the worldwide net sales and license royalties on sales of AEROSURF for the treatment of RDS in premature infants, up to an initial aggregate limit of $25 million, which under the Battelle Payment Restructuring (discussed below) was increased to $35 million. The Collaboration Agreement will end at the time we fulfill our payment obligations to Battelle, unless sooner terminated by a party as provided therein.
 
In December 2018, we and Battelle entered into a Payment Restructuring Agreement (Battelle Payment Restructuring), which reflected the terms of an October 2017 nonbinding memorandum of understanding, in which we outlined terms to restructure approximately $4.3 million then due to Battelle (at October 18, 2017, the Battelle Payables), under a Research and Development Services Agreement dated as of June 22, 2012 and the Collaboration Agreement.  Under the Battelle Payment Restructuring, Battelle Payables accrue interest at a rate of 6% per annum and Battelle participated in our December 2018 private placement equity financing (Private Placement Financing, discussed below) for $1.0 million in a debt-equity exchange for a like amount of Battelle Payables on the same terms as all other investors in the Private Placement Financing. In addition, within 10 days after the Private Placement Financing, or December 31. 2018, we paid Battelle cash in the amount of $972,281, and thereafter initiated payments totaling an aggregate $1,250,000, payable in five equal, consecutive monthly installments of $250,000.  In addition, we have agreed to make two milestone payments to Battelle as follow: (i) upon enrollment of the first patient in the next AEROSURF clinical study, an amount equal to one half of the then-outstanding Battelle Payables (including unpaid interest), and (ii) when we complete the device technology transfer for the phase 3 ADS to Mack, an amount equal to the then-outstanding Battelle Payables, including unpaid interest.  In addition, on December 11, 2018, we issued to Battelle warrants to purchase 75,000 shares of common stock, exercisable at a price of $6.50 per share, which expire on the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date.

As part of a 2004 restructuring, Esteve returned certain countries to us (Former Esteve Territories) and we agreed to pay Esteve 10% of any cash up front and milestone fees (up to a maximum aggregate of $20 million) that we receive in connection with any strategic collaborations for the development and/or commercialization of certain of our KL4 surfactant products in the Former Esteve Territories. In addition, with respect to our aerosolized KL4 surfactant, Esteve will pay us $0.5 million upon the initial filing for regulatory approval with the European Medicines Agency and $0.5 million upon receipt of regulatory approval; also, Esteve has agreed to contribute up to $3 million to support the phase 3 clinical trial in the territory. The alliance will terminate as to each covered product, on a country-by-country basis, upon the latest to occur of: the expiration of the last patent claim related to a covered product in such country; the first commercial sale in such country of the first-to-appear generic formulation of the covered product, and the tenth anniversary of the first sale of the covered product in such country.  In addition to customary termination provisions for breach of the agreement by a party, the alliance agreement may be terminated by Esteve on 60 days’ prior written notice, up to the date of receipt of the first marketing regulatory approval, or, on up to six months’ written notice, if the first marketing regulatory approval has issued.  We may terminate the alliance agreement in the event that Esteve acquires a competitive product (as defined in the agreement).
 
Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca 
 
Effective April 13, 2015, CVie Therapeutics entered into an Agreement for Scientific Collaboration (Agreement) with the Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca (Bicocca) in Milan, Italy, focused on defining the role of sarco (endo) plasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) and phospholamban (PLN) in modulating cardiac contraction, and discovering new small molecules to modulate SERCA2a activity or new drugs for treating chronic and acute human heart failure. The initial term of the Agreement was three years but the term was extended for approximately an additional year, with option for further renewal. We are currently in discussions potentially to extend this Agreement, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve an extension on acceptable terms, if at all.
 
Under the Agreement, intellectual property resulting from the collaboration, including patents and know-how, will be jointly owned by the parties. For the development of any new SERCA2a compounds and diagnostic products suitable for further clinical development, we have the option to purchase Bicocca’s interest for up to 12 months after the filing of a patent application. If the option is not exercised, then the parties shall remain joint owners and each can use the intellectual property with consent of the other on terms to be defined. If we exercise an option, we have agreed to pay Bicocca (corresponding to stage of development): (i) € 0.1 million (approximately $0.1 million) upon completion and the proof of concept of biological efficacy for new compounds modulating the SERCA2a activity caused by PLN mutations; and (ii) € 1.5 million (approximately $1.7 million) upon obtaining marketing authorization in the US, EU, or China of new compounds with the corresponding companion diagnostic assay. We have also agreed to pay royalties for any purchased intellectual property arising out of the collaboration in the range of a low- to mid-single digit percent of net sales for any products sold in any country for a period of ten years from the date of the first commercial sale.
 
Also, under the Agreement, we have provided funds aggregating € 0.2 million (approximately $0.2 million) to date to upgrade equipment and pay laboratory expenses for the renewal term expiring in 2019. We also funded several related research contracts for the period covered by the Agreement. In connection with our research activities, Bicocca agreed to provide us exclusive use of a research laboratory for the collaboration work, and nonexclusive access to a physiology laboratory within the university. Bicocca serves as our primary location in Milan.
 
Licensing, Patents and OTHER Proprietary Rights AND REGULATORY DESIGNATIONS
 
We continue to invest in maintaining and enforcing our potential competitive position through a number of means: (i) by protecting our exclusive rights in our cardiovascular agents including istaroxime, rostafuroxin and potential follow-on compounds, (ii) by protecting our exclusive rights in our lyophilized KL4 surfactant, ADS and aerosol-conducting airway connector technologies through patents that we own or exclusively license, (iii) by seeking regulatory exclusivities, including potential orphan drug and new drug product exclusivities, and (iv) through protecting our trade secrets and proprietary methodologies that support our manufacturing and analytical processes.
 
Licensing
 
Lee’s Pharmaceutical (HK) Ltd.
 
In June 2017, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement (License Agreement) with Lee’s (HK), a company organized under the laws of Hong Kong and an affiliate of Lee’s. Under the License Agreement, we granted to Lee’s (HK) an exclusive license with a right to sublicense (i) to develop and commercialize our KL4 surfactant products, including SURFAXIN, which was approved by the FDA in 2012 for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants, SURFAXIN LS™, the lyophilized dosage form of SURFAXIN, and AEROSURF, and (ii) to register and manufacture SURFAXIN and SURFAXIN LS for use in the licensed territory, which includes the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Hong Kong, Thailand, Taiwan and 12 other countries. In addition, we granted Lee’s (HK) options to potentially add Japan to the Licensed Territory, which was made effective in an August 2017 amendment (License Amendment, discussed below) and to manufacture our ADS in the licensed territory, in each case subject to conditions set forth in the License Agreement.
 
We amended the license in August 2017 to expand certain of Lee’s (HK)’s rights, including by immediately adding Japan to the licensed territory, accelerating the right to manufacture the ADS in and for the licensed territory, reducing or eliminating certain of the milestone and royalty payments and adding an affiliate of Lee’s (HK) as a party to the License Agreement.
 
 11


Under the License Agreement as amended, Lee’s (HK) made an upfront payment to us of $1 million. We also may receive up to $35.8 million in potential clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and will share in any sublicense income Lee’s (HK) may receive at a rate equal to low double digits. In addition, Lee’s (HK) will be responsible for all costs and expenses in and for the Licensed Territory related to development activities, including a planned AEROSURF phase 3 clinical program, regulatory activities, and commercialization activities.
 
We will be eligible to receive tiered royalties based on a percent of Net Sales (as defined in the License Agreement), depending on the product, in the range of high single to low-to-mid double-digit percentages. Royalties are payable on a country-by-country basis until the latest of (A) the expiration of the last valid patent claim covering the product in the country of sale, (B) the expiration or revocation of any applicable regulatory exclusivity in the country of sale, and (C) ten (10) years after the first commercial sale in the country of sale. Thereafter, in consideration of licensed rights other than patent rights, royalties shall continue for the commercial life of each product and, for the initial three years, shall be in the range of low-to-mid single digits. In addition, in the event that one or more generic products are introduced, the royalty rates will be reduced, subject to certain minimums if we are subject to continuing obligations at the time to pay royalties under our in-license agreements.
 
Under the License Agreement, Lee’s (HK) is responsible for all activities related to development, regulatory approval and commercialization of KL4 surfactant and combination drug / device products in the licensed territory. Lee’s (HK) will hold the product licenses for all non-aerosolized products in the licensed territory and will seek regulatory approval initially for SURFAXIN and SURFAXIN LS for RDS. We will hold the product license in the licensed territory (except where prohibited by law) for all aerosolized products and will designate Lee’s (HK) its exclusive agent and representative to develop and register AEROSURF and other aerosolized products in our name and on our behalf. Lee’s (HK) also has agreed that, except as provided in the License Agreement, for a period of ten (10) years beginning with the later of the first commercial sale of the first aerosolized product and the first commercial sale of the first non-aerosolized product in the PRC, it will not develop, register, manufacture, or commercialize any product for the prevention and/or treatment of RDS in premature infants or other diseases and conditions in humans, in either case, that administers, utilizes or contains pulmonary surfactant without our prior written consent.
 
Lee’s (HK) may sublicense certain activities under the License Agreement to an affiliate of Lee’s (HK), but may not grant sublicenses to unaffiliated third parties without our prior consent. A sublicensee and a subcontractor may not be a competitor that we identify to Lee’s (HK). Sublicensee rights under the License Agreement do not include the right to further sublicense. In addition, we and Lee’s (HK) entered into a technology transfer agreement under which we are transferring to Lee’s (HK) the manufacturing processes for SURFAXIN and SURFAXIN LS; and we and Lee’s (HK) plan to negotiate (i) a manufacturing agreement providing for the manufacture of SURFAXIN and SURFAXIN LS by Lee’s (HK) and giving us access to such products outside the licensed territory; (ii) a manufacturing and supply agreement providing for the manufacture and supply of AEROSURF drug and medical device components by us to Lee’s (HK); and (iii) such other agreements and amendments as may be necessary for the parties to perform their obligations under the License Agreement.
 
The term of the License Agreement commenced on the effective date of the License Agreement and will continue on a country-by-country basis for the commercial life of the products. Either party may terminate the License Agreement in the event of bankruptcy or a material breach of the License Agreement by the other party that remains uncured for a period of sixty (60) days. In addition, either party may terminate the License Agreement in its entirety or with respect to any individual product or country if a regulatory authority terminates, suspends or discontinues development of a product and such termination, suspension or discontinuance persists for a period in excess of eighteen (18) months. Upon termination of the License Agreement in its entirety or with respect to a particular product or country, generally all related rights and licenses granted to Lee’s (HK) will terminate, all rights under our technology will revert to us, and Lee’s (HK) will cease all use of our technology.
 
Patents and Proprietary Rights 
 
In addition to the inventions covered by the patents and patent applications described in this Form 10-K, we have been active in identifying and seeking to identify new patents. We have filed and plan to file patent and provisional patent applications to protect our innovations relating to our current and potential future product candidates, including for composition of matter, new dosage forms, formulations, methods of manufacture, methods of use and related processes. We intend to file for patent protection for select inventions, in such markets that we deem material to our patent strategy, as well as for other new inventions that we may identify.

Trademarks
 
AEROSURF®, AFECTAIR®, DiscoveryLabs®, DISCOVERYLABS INSPIRED INNOVATION (logo)®, SURFAXIN®, SURFAXIN LS™, WINDTREE™ and WINDTREE THERAPEUTICS™ are our registered and common law trademarks.
 
Trade Secrets
 
In addition to our patent exclusivities, we rely on trade secrets to protect and maintain our competitive position. We take measures to protect and maintain our trade secrets and know-how licensed to us or developed by us by entering in confidentiality agreements with third parties. Our trade secrets and know-how include information related to manufacturing processes for our drug products and devices, analytical methods and procedures, research and development activities, provisional patent applications, as well as certain information provided to the FDA that was not made public which relates to our regulatory activities and clinical trials.
Other Regulatory Designations 
 
Orphan Drug and Orphan Medicinal Product Designations
 
The FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation for (i) our KL4 surfactant (lucinactant) for the treatment of RDS in premature infants, (ii) our KL4 surfactant for the prevention and treatment of BPD in premature infants, (iii) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults, and (iv) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of CF. See, – Government Regulation – Drug Products – Orphan Drugs.
 
The European Commission (EC) grants Orphan Medicinal Product designation for pharmaceutical products for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than 5 in 10,000 people which provides for exclusive marketing rights for indications in Europe for 10 years (subject to revision after six years) following marketing approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In addition, the designation would enable us to receive regulatory assistance in the further development process, and to access reduced regulatory fees throughout its marketing life. The EC has granted Orphan Medicinal Product designation for (i) our KL4 surfactant for the prevention of RDS in premature neonates of less than 32 weeks gestational age, (ii) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of RDS in premature neonates of less than 37 weeks gestational age, (iii) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of ALI (which in this circumstance encompasses ARDS), and (iv) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of CF. In submitting the requests to the EMA for Orphan Medicinal Product designations, instead of listing the drug product under the USAN name (lucinactant) as we have in the US, we were required to submit our requests under the names of the four APIs in our KL4 surfactant (lucinactant) as follows: sinapultide (KL4), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol and palmitic acid.
Fast Track Designations and Priority Review
 
The FDA has granted Fast Track designation for (i) our KL4 surfactant for the prevention and treatment of BPD in premature infants, (ii) our KL4 surfactant for ARDS in adults, and (iii)  our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of RDS. We believe that other of our products may qualify for Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation or other expedited programs. These designations and programs are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of an NDA to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. See, – Government Regulation – Drug Products – Fast Track Designation.

COMPETITION
 
The biotechnology industry is a highly competitive industry. As we work to gain marketing authorization for our product candidates, competition from numerous existing pharmaceutical companies and other companies entering our fields is expected to be intense and expected to increase. In fact, our future competitors are competing with us currently to secure access to development resources, including clinical sites and their patients to advance development programs. We expect that those companies that are successful at being the first to introduce new products and technologies to the market may gain significant advantages over their competitors in the establishment of a customer base and track record for the performance of their products and technologies. Moreover, there are also existing therapies that may compete with the products we are developing. Therefore, as a development stage biotechnology company, our competitors are comprised of other biotechnology firms and pharmaceutical companies that have existing products or are developing products for our primary markets -- respiratory and cardiovascular indications.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
In the US, drug products, medical devices, and drug/device combination products are subject to extensive regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, clearance, labeling, promotion, advertising and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of drug products, medical devices, and drug/device combination products. Failure to comply with applicable US requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve or clear pending new submissions to market drugs or devices warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. Drug products, medical devices, and drug/device combination products must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before they may be marketed in the US. Drug products, medical devices, and drug/device combination products are subject to extensive regulation, including premarket review and marketing authorization, by similar agencies in other countries.
Drug Products
 
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the US typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which the FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of the FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on US patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
 16


The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in phase 2 evaluations, phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 
The manufacturer of an investigational drug in a phase 2 or 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. The FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the US. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,588,000 for fiscal year 2019, and the applicant under an approved new drug application is also subject to an annual program fee, currently exceeding $309,000 per product for fiscal year 2019, which replaced the annual product and establishment fees. These fees are typically increased annually.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be filed based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the NDA submission is filed, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee - typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts - for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 
 17


An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and the FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 
Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition – generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the US. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the US for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
Fast Track Designation 
 
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 
Under the fast track program, sponsors have the opportunity to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA. In addition, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
The Hatch-Waxman Act
 
Orange Book Listing: In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims covering the applicant’s product or method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 
 18


The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a Section VIII statement certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been received by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
An applicant submitting an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDC Act, which permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, is required to certify to the FDA regarding any patents listed in the Orange Book for the approved product it references to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 
Market Exclusivity: Market exclusivity provisions under the FDC Act also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDC Act provides a five-year period of non-patent exclusivity within the US to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, or NCE. A drug is entitled to NCE exclusivity if it contains a drug substance no active moiety of which has been previously approved by the FDA. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not receive for review an ANDA or file a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification. The FDC Act also provides three years of market exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions for use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs for the original conditions of use, such as the originally approved indication. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Patent Term Extension: After NDA approval, the owner of a relevant drug patent may apply for up to five years of patent term extension. Only one patent may be extended for each regulatory review period, which is composed of two parts: a testing phase, and an approval phase. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase - the time between the day the IND becomes effective and NDA submission – and all of the review phase – the time between NDA submission and approval – up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total remaining patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
 
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent term extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent term extension granted, the post-approval patent term extension is reduced by one year. The director of the US Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent term extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 
 19


Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, prescription drug manufacturers in the US must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities, and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate products.
 
Pediatric Information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. the FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted except a product with a new active ingredient that is molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined by the FDA to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer that is subject to an NDA or BLA submitted on or after August 18, 2020.
 
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Medical Device Products
 
A medical device is an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component part, or accessory which is: (i) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the US Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them; (ii) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or (iii) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes.
 
The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the fewest regulatory controls. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices and are subject to the highest level of regulatory control to provide reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness. Class III devices must typically be approved by the FDA before they are marketed.
 
Generally, establishments that manufacture and/or distribute devices, including manufacturers, contract manufacturers, sterilizers, repackagers and relabelers, specification developers, reprocessors of single-use devices, remanufacturers, initial importers, manufacturers of accessories and components sold directly to the end user, and US manufacturers of export-only devices, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and provide the FDA a list of the devices that they handle at their facilities.
 
 20


Pre-market Authorization and Notification
 
While most Class I and some Class II devices can be marketed without prior FDA authorization, most medical devices can be legally sold within the US only if the FDA has: (i) approved a premarket approval application, or PMA, prior to marketing, generally applicable to Class III devices; or (ii) cleared the device in response to a premarket notification, or 510(k) submission, generally applicable to Class I and II devices. Some devices that have been classified as Class III are regulated pursuant to the 510(k) requirements because the FDA has not yet called for PMAs for these devices. Other less common regulatory pathways to market for certain devices include the de novo classification process, the humanitarian device exception, or HDE, or a product development protocol, or PDP. 
Exempt Devices
 
If a manufacturer's device falls into a generic category of Class I or Class II devices that the FDA has exempted by regulation, a premarket notification is not required before marketing the device in the US. Manufacturers of such devices are required to register their establishments and list the proprietary device name and the generic category or classification regulation into which the device fits. Some 510(k)-exempt devices are also exempt from Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements.
Post-market Requirements
 
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the QSR, labeling regulations, the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or off-label uses, the Medical Device Reporting regulation (which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation (which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act).
 
The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as: fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals already granted; and criminal prosecution.
 
Combination Products 
 
A combination product is a product comprised of (i) two or more regulated components, i.e., drug/device, biologic/device, drug/biologic, or drug/device/biologic, that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; (ii) two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; (iii) a drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where, upon approval of the proposed product, the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or (iv) any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.
 
The FDA is divided into various branches, or Centers, by product type. Different Centers typically review drug, biologic, or device applications. In order to review an application for a combination product, the FDA must decide which Center should be responsible for the review. FDA regulations require that the FDA determine the combination product’s primary mode of action, or PMOA, which is the single mode of a combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. The Center that regulates that portion of the product that generates the PMOA becomes the lead evaluator. If there are two independent modes of action, neither of which is subordinate to the other, the FDA makes a determination as to which Center to assign the product based on consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions or to the Center with the most expertise in evaluating the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product. When evaluating an application, a lead Center may consult other Centers but still retain complete reviewing authority, or it may collaborate with another Center, by which the Center assigns review of a specific section of the application to another Center, delegating its review authority for that section. Typically, the FDA requires a single marketing application submitted to the Center selected to be the lead evaluator, although the agency has the discretion to require separate applications to more than one Center. One reason to submit multiple evaluations is if the applicant wishes to receive some benefit that accrues only from approval under a particular type of application, like new drug product exclusivity. If multiple applications are submitted, each may be evaluated by a different lead Center.
 
 21


International Approvals
 
Drug products, medical devices, and drug/device combination products are subject to extensive regulation, including premarket review and marketing authorization, by similar agencies in other countries. Regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in approach to that of the US but are not harmonized. International regulators are independent and not bound by the findings of the FDA and there is a risk that foreign regulators will not accept clinical trial design/results or may require additional data or other information not requested by the FDA. In addition, international regulators may require different manufacturing practices than the FDA’s cGMPs.
Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws
 
In addition to the FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, medical devices, and combination products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the medical product industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, and other statutes pertaining to health care fraud and abuse. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.
 
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, PPACA amended the healthcare program anti-kickback statute such that a violation can serve as a basis for liability under the federal false claims law. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror/payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the healthcare fraud statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
 
Other Federal and State Regulatory Requirements 
 
Pursuant to PPACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a final rule that requires manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reports must be submitted on an annual basis and the reported data are posted in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Effective January 1, 2022, transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives will also be required.
 
In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Additional jurisdictions, such as the City of Chicago and the District of Columbia, require pharmaceutical sales representatives to be licensed and meet continuing education requirements. Several additional states are considering similar proposals.  Compliance with these laws is difficult and time-consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.

Net loss on debt extinguishment
 
In December 2018, as part of the Private Placement Financing, we converted $6.0 million of existing loan payable obligations to LPH and $1.0 million of existing collaboration and device development payables to Battelle (Battelle Payables) on the same terms as the Investors of the Private Placement Financing. The conversions of the loan payable to LPH and the Battelle Payables are treated as extinguishments of debt and we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $3.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, resulting from the difference between the fair value of the common stock and warrants issued and the carrying value of the obligations. In December 2018, we also repaid our convertible note payable with Panacea in its entirety in cash of $1.5 million. As part of the extinguishment of debt, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.4 million, relating to the reacquisition of the beneficial conversion option.
 
Gain on debt restructuring
 
In November 2017, we restructured and retired a secured loan (Deerfield Loan) with affiliates of Deerfield Management, L.P.(Deerfield) This transaction was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt in accordance with ASC 470, Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments, and as a result, we recognized a $5.8 million non-cash gain on debt restructuring (see, – Liquidity and Capital Resources –Restructured Debt Liability).

Interest expense in 2018 consists of (i) interest expense of $0.3 million related to the Battelle Payables; (ii) interest expense of $0.2 million related to the loan payable obligations to LPH; and (iii) interest expense of $0.1 million related to our convertible note payable with Panacea. Non-cash amortization of debt discounts relates to our convertible note payable with Panacea, which was extinguished in December 2018, and to a discount on Battelle Payables.
 
Interest expense in 2017 primarily consists of interest expense associated with the Deerfield Loan (see, – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Restructured Debt Liability).
 
 48



Non-cash amortization of prepaid interest expense represents non-cash amortization of $5 million of Series A Units and Series B units that Deerfield purchased in our July 2015 public offering and accepted in satisfaction of $5 million of future interest payments calculated at an interest rate of 8.75% under the Deerfield Loan. 
 
Other income
 
Other income in 2018 consists of proceeds from the sale of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania research and development tax credits, partially offset by $0.1 million of foreign currency losses.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $11.2 million and available-for-sale, marketable securities of $14.0 million, current liabilities of $20.6 million, including $8.0 million of Loan payable (see, Note 11 - Loan Payable).  As of April 5, 2019, we believe that we have sufficient resources (including marketable securities) available to support our development activities, business operations and debt service through October 2019.
 
Although we believe that the CVie Acquisition and $39 million Private Placement Financing have improved our financial position and may better position us to raise the capital needed to fund our business plans, we expect to continue to incur significant losses and require significant additional capital to advance our clinical development programs, support our operations and business development efforts, and satisfy our obligations beyond October 2019, and we do not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents for at least the next year following the date that the financial statements are issued. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
 
To alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, management plans to raise additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings and strategic transactions, including but not limited to potential alliances and collaborations focused on various individual markets; however, none of these alternatives are committed at this time.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any public or private equity offerings on acceptable terms, or in amounts required to support our operations, if at all, or identify and enter into any strategic transactions that will bring the capital that we will require. If none of these alternatives is available, or if available, we are unable to raise sufficient capital through such transactions, we will not have sufficient cash resources and liquidity to fund our business operations for at least the next year following the date that the financial statements are issued. Accordingly, management has concluded that substantial doubt exists with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern through one year after the issuance of the accompanying financial statements.
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
As of December 31, 2018, there were 120 million shares of common stock and 5 million shares of preferred stock authorized under our Certificate of Incorporation, and approximately 72.0 million shares of common stock and 5.0 million shares of preferred stock available for issuance and not otherwise reserved.

Cash Flows
 
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $11.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Net cash outflows for 2018 consisted of $15.8 million net cash used for ongoing operating activities, $13.7 million of net cash used in investing activities, offset by $38.7 million of net cash provided financing activities.
Operating Activities
 
Net cash used in operating activities was $15.8 million and $21.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities from 2017 is attributable to a $6.0 million decrease in operating expenses offset by other changes in working capital.
Investing Activities
 
Net cash used in investing activities was $13.7 million and $24,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in net cash used in investing activities is due to the purchase of $13.9 million of marketable securities with the proceeds from the December 2018 Private Placement (see, Private Placement Offerings).
 
Financing Activities
 
Net cash provided by financing activities was $38.7 million and $17.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, summarized as follows:

Financings Pursuant to Common Stock Offerings
 
Historically, we have funded, and expect that we will continue to fund, our business operations through various sources, including financings in the form of equity offerings. Since May 2017, we are no longer eligible to use a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3. Accordingly, until we are again eligible to use the registration statement on Form S-3, we plan to conduct future equity offerings through private placement transactions
Private Placement Offerings
 
On December 21, 2018, we completed a private placement offering with select institutional investors (Investors), for the purchase of an aggregate of 11,785,540 shares of common stock at a price per share of $3.3132, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $39.0 million (Private Placement Financing). Included in the purchase price, each of LPH II Investments Limited (LPH II), an affiliate of Lee’s Pharmaceutical Holdings Ltd. (Lee’s), and Battelle Memorial Institute converted $6.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of existing debt obligations on the same terms as the other Investors. In connection with this offering, we issued (i) Series F Warrants  to purchase an aggregate of 2,003,541 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to $3.68 per share, which are exercisable through the 18-month anniversary of the date of issuance (the Series F Warrants), and (ii) Series G Warrants  to purchase an aggregate of 3,889,229 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to $4.05 per share, which are exercisable through the 5-year anniversary of the date of issuance (the Series G Warrants and, together with the Series F Warrants, the December 2018 Warrants). The December 2018 Warrants (i) may not be exercised to the extent that following such exercise, the holder would beneficially own more than 9.99% (or other percent as designated by each holder) of our outstanding shares of common stock, and (ii) contain customary provisions that adjust the exercise price and the number of shares of common stock into which the December 2018 Warrants are exercisable in the event of a corporate transaction.
 
 50


In April 2018, we completed a private placement with LPH II for the purchase of $2.6 million of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock at a purchase price per share of $4.80. In connection with this offering, we issued 541,667 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 135,417 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.52 per share. The warrants are exercisable after 6 months and through the seventh anniversary of the issue date.
 
In October 2017, we completed a private placement offering with LPH Investments Limited, a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability and an affiliate of Lee’s (LPH), for the purchase of $10.0 million of our common stock at a price of $4.326 per share, which represented a 15% premium over the average of the daily volume-weighted average price per share (VWAP) over the 10-day trading period ending on and including the date of the related agreement, and issued in 2,311,604 shares of our common stock.  Following the transaction, Lee's beneficially owned 73% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The investment included cancellation of $3.9 million in outstanding loans that we had borrowed from Lee’s Pharmaceutical (HK) Ltd., a Hong Kong company organized and existing under the laws of Hong Kong (Lee's (HK)) under a Loan Agreement dated August 14, 2017, between ourselves and Lee's (HK).
 
On February 15, 2017, we completed a private placement offering of 7,049 Series A Convertible Preferred Stock units for net proceeds of approximately $10.5 million, including $1.6 million of non-cash consideration in the form of a reduction in amounts due and accrued as of December 31, 2016 for current development services that otherwise would have become payable in cash in the first and second quarters of 2017. Each unit consists of (i) one share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (Preferred Shares); and (ii) 50 Series A-1 Warrants to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price equal to $27.40. All outstanding Preferred Shares were converted in accordance with their terms in advance of the merger.
 
At-the-Market Program (ATM Program)
 
Stifel ATM Program 
 
In 2013, we entered into an At-the-Market Equity Sales Agreement (ATM Agreement) with Stifel, under which Stifel, as our exclusive agent, agreed to sell on our behalf up to a maximum of $25 million of shares of our common stock (ATM Program). We agreed to pay Stifel a commission equal to 3.0% of the gross sales price of any shares sold pursuant to the ATM Agreement.  Effective with our transition to the OTCQB® Market (OTCQB) tier in early May 2017, the ATM Program was no longer available to us.
 
During 2017, we completed registered offerings of our common stock under the ATM Program of 42,357 shares, resulting in aggregate gross and net proceeds to us of approximately $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively.  
 
Loan Payable
 
In January 2018 and March 2018, LPH Investments Limited (LPH), an affiliate of Lee’s, agreed to lend us $1.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, to support our AEROSURF development activities and sustain our operations while we sought to identify and advance one or more potential strategic initiatives as defined in the related loan agreements (Funding Event).   The loans accrue interest at a rate of 6% per annum and mature upon the earlier of the closing date of the Funding Event or December 31, 2018. To secure our obligations under these loans, we granted LPH a security interest in substantially all our assets pursuant to the terms of a Security Agreement with LPH dated March 1, 2018 (LPH Security Agreement).
 
During the third and fourth quarters of 2018, LPH agreed to lend us funds to sustain our operations while we continued to work on a strategic transaction. The initial loan was funded on August 14, 2018 in the amount of $0.3 million, and subsequent loans on the following dates and in the following amounts: August 29, 2018, in the amount of $0.48 million, September 12, 2018 in the amount of $0.5 million; September 27, 2018 in the amount of $0.5 million; October 19, 2018 in the amount of $0.43 million; November 2, 2018 in the amount of $0.5 million; November 19, 2018 in the amount of $0.35 million; and December 5, 2018 in the amount of $0.6 million. The loans accrued interest at a rate of 6% per annum and matured upon the earlier of (i) the closing date for the strategic transaction (as defined in the related loan agreements), provided that the Company was able to raise a minimum of $30 million in connection with such transaction, or (ii) March 31, 2019. In each case, we granted to LPH a security interest in substantially all of our assets pursuant to the terms of the LPH Security Agreement.
 
 51


Extinguishment of Loan Payable
 
On December 21, 2018, as part of the Private Placement Financing, we converted $6.0 million of existing loan payable obligations to LPH on the same terms as those of the Investors of the Private Placement Financing. In connection of the conversion of Lee’s debt, we issued: (i) 1,810,938 shares of common stock based at $3.3132 per share, (ii) Series F Warrants to purchase 307,859 shares of common stock, at an exercise price equal to $3.68 per share, and (iii) Series G Warrants to purchase 597,610 shares common stock, at an exercise price equal to $4.05 per share. The Series F Warrants are exercisable at any time after the date of issuance and through the 18-month anniversary of the date of issuance and the Series G Warrants may be exercised through the 5-year anniversary of the date of issuance.
 
The conversion of the loan payable to LPH is treated as an extinguishment of debt and does not represent a capital transaction as the Private Placement Financing included third-party investors and all investors received identical terms. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt approximately $3.2 million. The loss was calculated as the difference between: (i) the aggregate fair value of approximately $9.2 million, based on the fair value of the common stock and Warrants on December 21, 2018, and (ii) the carrying value of the debt liabilities of $6.0 million.
 
The balance of the loan payable to LPH of $160,000 was paid along with accrued interest of $182,000 on December 27, 2018.
 
Assumption of bank debt as part of the CVie Acquisition
 
As part of the CVie Acquisition, we assumed approximately $4.6 million (or NTD $138.0 million) in a bank credit facility due in March 2020.
 
In September 2016, CVie entered into a 12-month revolving credit facility of approximately $2.9 million (or NTD $90.0 million) with O-Bank Co., Ltd. to finance operating activities. The facility was later renewed and increased to approximately $5.8 million (or NTD $180.0 million) in September 2017. The credit facility was guaranteed by Lee’s, which is required to pledge bank deposits in the amount of 110% of the actual borrowing amount. Interest, payable in cash on a monthly basis, is determined based on 90-day TAIBOR (the Taipei Interbank Offer Rate) plus 0.91%. The credit facility will expire on September 11, 2019 and matures six months after the expiration date, on March 11, 2020. Although we reached an understanding with Lee’s that it would maintain the bank deposits securing its guaranty obligation under the credit facility, we do not have a written agreement with Lee’s requiring it to do so; therefore, the $4.5 million outstanding under the facility has been classified as a current liability on the balance sheet.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding principal was approximately $4.5 million (or NTD $138.0 million), due to exchange rate fluctuations.
 
Assumption of Lee’s debt as part of the CVie Acquisition
 
As part of the CVie Acquisition, we assumed approximately $3.5 million (or NTD $106.2 million) of debt payable to Lee’s.
 
From April 24, 2018 to November 16, 2018, CVie entered into four separate agreements to borrow an aggregate of approximately $3.50 million from Lee’s. The terms of the loan agreements are identical where the interest, payable in cash upon maturity, is 4% per annum and each of the four separate loans will mature one year from the effective date as follows: $0.50 million in April 2019; $0.3 million in September 2019; $0.2 million in October 2019; and $2.5 million in November 2019.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding principal was approximately $3.5 million (or NTD $106.2 million), due to exchange rate fluctuations.
 
Convertible Note Payable
 
On July 2, 2018, we issued to Panacea Venture Management Company Ltd. (Panacea) a Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the Note) with respect to a loan facility in the aggregate amount of up to $1.5 million, which was funded in two loans of, $1.0 million on the date of the Note and $0.5 million on July 23, 2018. The Note had a maturity date of December 31, 2018 and accrued interest at a rate of 15% per annum until the Note was paid in full or converted into shares of our common stock at a price per share of $4.00. In addition, in lieu of converting the Note, Panacea could deliver the Note into a private placement in which Panacea Venture Healthcare Fund I L.P., an affiliate of Panacea, participated. In connection with these Loans, we granted to Panacea a security interest in substantially all our assets.
 
 52


In connection with the Note, we issued to Panacea warrants (the Series D Warrants) to purchase 187,500 shares (the Warrant Shares) at an exercise price of $4.00 per Warrant Share (the Exercise Price). The Warrants may be exercised at any time beginning six months after the date of issuance and through the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance. The Warrants may not be exercised to the extent that the holder thereof would, following such exercise, beneficially own more than 9.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, which percentage may be increased, decreased or waived by such holder upon sixty-one days’ notice to us. The Warrants also contain customary provisions that adjust the Exercise Price and the number of Warrant Shares in the event of a corporate transaction.
 
We recorded the Note as current debt at its face value of $1.5 million less debt discounts consisting of (i) $0.4 million fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the Note and (ii) a $0.4 million beneficial conversion feature related to an embedded conversion option that had an effective conversion price that was less than the fair value of the underlying stock at the commitment date. The discount is being accreted to the $1.5 million loan over its term using the effective interest method. The Panacea Warrants are derivatives that qualify for an exemption from liability accounting as provided for in ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity, and have been classified as equity.
 
The fair value at issuance of the Panacea Warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The input assumptions used in the valuation are the historical volatility of our common stock price, the expected term of the warrants, and the risk-free interest rate based on the five-year treasury bill rate in effect at the measurement date.

Extinguishment of Panacea Convertible Promissory Note
 
On December 27, 2018, we repaid the Note in its entirety in cash of $1.5 million. As part of the extinguishment of debt, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.4 million, relating to the reacquisition of the beneficial conversion option. The gain was calculated using the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion option, which is the product of: (i) the difference between the common stock price on the date of extinguishment of $5.11 and the conversion price of $4.00, and (ii) 375,000 shares convertible into common stock.

Restructured debt liability - contingent milestone payments | $ | 15,000 | | $ | 15,000

 

On November 1, 2017, we and Deerfield entered into an Exchange and Termination Agreement pursuant to which (i) promissory notes evidencing a loan with affiliates of Deerfield Management Company L.P. (Deerfield Loan) in the aggregate principal amount of $25 million and (ii) warrants to purchase up to 25,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $786.80 per share held by Deerfield were cancelled in consideration for (i) a cash payment in the aggregate amount of $2.5 million, (ii) 71,111 shares of common stock, representing 2% of fully-diluted shares outstanding (as defined in the Exchange and Termination Agreement) on the closing date, and (iii) the right to receive certain milestone payments based on achievement of specified AEROSURF development and commercial milestones, which, if achieved, could potentially total up to $15 million. In addition, a related security agreement, pursuant to which Deerfield held a security interest in substantially all of our assets, was terminated. We established a $15 million long-term liability for the contingent milestone payments potentially due to Deerfield under the Exchange and Termination Agreement (see, Note 5 – Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements). The liability has been recorded at full value of the contingent milestones and will continue to be carried at full value until the milestones are achieved and paid or milestones are not achieved and the liability is written off as a gain on debt restructuring.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
We did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2018 or 2017, or during the periods then ended.
