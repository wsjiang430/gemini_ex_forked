Item 1. Business

Overview of the Company’s Business

Sterling Construction Company, Inc., ("Sterling" or "the Company") was founded in 1991 as a Delaware corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 1800 Hughes Landing Boulevard, Suite 250, The Woodlands, Texas 77380 and our telephone number at this address is (281) 214-0800. Our construction business was founded in 1955 by a predecessor company in Michigan and is now conducted through our subsidiaries which primarily include: J. Banicki Construction, Inc., an Arizona corporation, or "JBC"; Myers & Sons Construction, L.P., a California limited partnership, or "Myers"; Myers & Sons Construction, LLC, a California limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Myers; Ralph L. Wadsworth Construction Company, LLC, a Utah limited liability company, or "RLW"; Road and Highway Builders, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, or "RHB"; Tealstone Commercial, Inc., a Texas corporation, or "TCI"; Tealstone Residential Concrete, Inc., a Texas corporation, or "TRC"; and Texas Sterling Construction Co., a Delaware corporation, or "TSC". TCI and TRC combined are referred to as "Tealstone." The terms “Company,” “Sterling,” and “we” refer to Sterling Construction Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries except when it is clear that those terms mean only the parent company or a particular subsidiary.

The Company is a construction company that specializes in heavy civil infrastructure construction and infrastructure rehabilitation as well as residential construction projects. We operate primarily in Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Texas and Utah, as well as other states in which there are feasible construction opportunities. Heavy civil construction projects include highways, roads, bridges, airfields, ports, light rail, water, wastewater and storm drainage systems, foundations for multi-family homes, commercial concrete projects and parking structures. Residential construction projects include concrete foundations for single-family homes.

Sterling has grown its service profile and geographic reach both organically and through acquisitions. RHB was acquired in 2007, which expanded the footprint into Nevada and Hawaii. Expansions into Utah, Arizona and California were achieved with the 2009 acquisition of RLW and the 2011 acquisitions of JBC and Myers, respectively. Expansion into single family home residential concrete foundation projects was achieved with the 2017 acquisition of Tealstone. 

Recent Developments

In 2018, the Company's revenues increased to $1,037.7 million, from $958.0 million in 2017. Our 2018 operating income totaled $42.6 million and net income attributable to Sterling common stockholders was $25.2 million compared to an operating income of $26.2 million and a net income of $11.6 million in 2017. Our gross margins have increased to 10.6% in 2018 from 9.3% in 2017. In addition, the Company generated $39.5 million of cash from operations, repaid $10.4 million of debt and repurchased $4.7 million of common stock in 2018.
The Company's financial improvements reflect progress in delivering our multi-year strategy to solidify the base, grow high margin products and expand into adjacent markets. Our strategic element to solidify the base of the heavy civil construction business focuses on cost reductions, remaining disciplined at the bid table, monitoring pricing at the time of bid, and executing the projects to expectations. The strategy element to grow high margin products is reflected in the increasing percentage of backlog of non-heavy highway projects. Finally, expansion of the residential business, as well as other acquisition opportunities, will lead to further expansion into adjacent markets. Overall, the execution of our strategy led to improved operating income of $42.6 million in 2018 compared to an operating income of $26.2 million in 2017.

Sterling's heavy civil construction business is primarily driven by federal, state and municipal funding. Federal funds, on average, provide 50% of annual State Department of Transportation (DOT) capital outlays for highway and bridge projects. Several of the states in Sterling's key markets have instituted actions to further increase annual spending. In November 2018, various state and local transportation measures were passed securing funding of $1.57 billion in California, $1.27 billion in Texas, $528.5 million in Arizona, $128.2 million in Colorado and $87 million in Utah. In October 2018, the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorized $3.35 billion annually for the next five years. This reauthorization also includes more than $1 billion a year for airport infrastructure grants and about $1.7 billion for disaster relief. In Texas, two constitutional amendments were passed in 2015, which will increase the annual funds allocated to transportation projects from $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion per year. Texas also has locally approved bonds estimated at $1.3 billion that were approved in November 2017. In Utah, a 20% gas tax increase to support infrastructure projects was put into effect January 2016, which is the first state gas tax increase in 18 years. The State of Utah also approved, in 2017, a $1 billion bond package for infrastructure improvements. A 1-cent sales tax increase was approved in Los Angeles, California in 2016 that will provide $3 billion per year for local road, bridge and transit projects. In addition, California approved a 10 year $52 billion bill that provides an annual $5 billion in incremental funding for use on highway transit repair projects. In addition to the state locally funded actions, Sterling is in year four of the 2015 federally funded five-year $305 billion surface transportation bill that increased the annual federal highway investment by 15.1% over the five-year period from 2016 to 2020. 
Initiation of a 2 Million Share Stock Repurchase Program
On November 2, 2018, the Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to 2 million shares of its outstanding common stock through June 30, 2020. The repurchase program permits shares to be repurchased in the open market or in private transactions and pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations. Repurchases will be made at management's discretion at prices that management considers to be attractive and in the best interests of both Sterling and its stockholders. The timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the availability of stock, general market conditions, the trading price of the stock, alternative uses for capital and Sterling's financial performance. The repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate. The repurchase program does not obligate Sterling to purchase any particular number of shares.
 Tealstone Acquisition 
On April 3, 2017, the Company consummated the acquisition (the “Tealstone Acquisition”) of 100% of the outstanding stock of Tealstone from the stockholders thereof (the “Sellers”) for consideration totaling $84 million and up to an aggregate of $15.0 million in earn-out payments if specified financial performance levels are achieved. Tealstone focuses on concrete construction of residential foundations, parking structures, elevated slabs and other concrete work for leading homebuilders, multi-family developers and general contractors in both residential and commercial markets. This acquisition enables expansion into adjacent markets and diversification of revenue streams and customer base with higher margin work.
 In conjunction with the Tealstone Acquisition, on April 3, 2017, the Company, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as agent, and the lenders party thereto (the “Oaktree Facility”), providing for a term loan of $85.0 million (the “Loan”) with a maturity date of April 4, 2022, which replaced the then existing debt facility. The Loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Our Markets and Customers

Our operations are performed under our heavy civil construction and residential construction segments within the United States (“U.S.”). See Note 18 - Segment Information for additional details (references to “Note” or “Notes” refer to the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in this annual report on Form 10-K).
Heavy Civil Construction
Our heavy civil construction segment relies heavily on federal and state infrastructure spending. In our heavy civil construction segment, our principal markets are Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Texas and Utah. Within our principal markets, our core customers are the departments of transportation in various states DOTs, regional transit authorities, airport authorities, port authorities, water authorities, railroads and commercial construction customers.

Currently, our largest customers are Utah, Texas and California DOTs. The Utah DOT contributed more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2018. We routinely construct projects for these customers. If we lost any of these customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Refer to Item 1A "Risk Factors" and Note 16 - Concentration of Risk and Enterprise Wide Disclosures for the Company’s major customers that represent a concentration of risk due to their significant revenue contributions. 
Residential Construction
Our residential construction segment's principal market is Texas, specifically the Dallas-Fort Worth area and the surrounding communities. The core customer base for residential construction segment is primarily made up of leading national home builders as well as regional and custom home builders. Our largest customers are Pulte Group, Inc., D.R. Horton, Inc., Lennar and HISTORYMAKER Homes. 
Competition
Our competition for both segments ranges from small local contractors to large international construction companies. We traditionally try to position ourselves to bid on work that is too large for the small local contractors yet too small for the large national and international construction companies. However, if market conditions became less favorable, we would tend to see migration from both the small local contractors and large international players into that geographical market. This, in return, could increase competitive bidding pressure and reduce both revenue growth and margins. See the section below entitled, Item 1A. "Risk Factors."
Seasonality
Our operations for both segments are typically affected by weather conditions primarily during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, which may alter construction schedules and can create variability in our revenues, profitability and the required number of employees.
Source and Availability of Raw Materials
We purchase raw materials for both segments, including but not limited to, cement, aggregate, concrete, liquid asphalt, steel, diesel and gasoline fuel, natural gas and propane from numerous sources. The price and availability of raw materials may vary from year to year due to fluctuations in market conditions and production capacities. We do not foresee a lack of availability of any necessary raw materials over the next twelve months.
Heavy Civil Construction Backlog 
Components of our heavy civil construction Combined Backlog are as follows:

• | "Backlog" is the unearned revenue we expect to earn in future periods on our executed heavy civil construction contracts. Backlog was $851 million and $744 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As the construction on our projects progress, we increase or decrease Backlog to take into account signed contracts, revenue earned during the period and our estimates of the effects of changes in estimated quantities, changed conditions, change orders and other variations from previously anticipated contract revenues, including completion penalties and incentives. We anticipate that approximately 75% of our Backlog will be recognized as revenues during 2019. 


• | We exclude from "Backlog" contracts in which we are the apparent low bidder for projects (“Unsigned Low-bid Awards”) until the contract is executed by our customer. Unsigned Low-bid Awards were $293 million at December 31, 2018 and $250 million at the end of 2017. We expect substantially all of the Unsigned Low-bid Awards at December 31, 2018 to be signed and included in Backlog in the first half of 2019.


• | The combination of our Backlog and Unsigned Low-bid Awards, which we refer to as "Combined Backlog," totaled $1.1 billion and $995 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Types of Contracts
Our contracts are awarded on a competitively bid basis or negotiated bid basis using a range of contracting options, including cost-reimbursable, lump sum and fixed-unit price. Each contract is designed to optimize the balance between risk and reward. At December 31, 2018, approximately 80% of our backlog was contracted on a fixed-unit price or lump sum basis. See Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of our types of risk and how we mitigate cancellation and credit risk.
Insurance and Bonding
Our buildings and equipment are covered by insurance, at levels which our management believes to be adequate. In addition, we maintain general liability and excess liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance and auto insurance all in amounts consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice.

As a normal part of the heavy civil construction business, we are generally required to provide various types of surety and payment bonds that provide an additional measure of security for our performance under the contract. Typically, a bidder for a contract must post a bid bond, generally for 5% to 10% of the bid amount, and on being awarded the bid, must post a performance and payment bond for 100% of the costs to construct. Usually, upon posting of the performance bond, a contractor must also post a maintenance bond for generally 1% of the contract amount for one to two years. Our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon our capitalization, working capital, aggregate contract size, past performance, management expertise and external factors, including the capacity of the overall surety market. Surety companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our backlog that we have currently bonded and their current underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. As is customary, we have agreed to indemnify our bonding company for all losses incurred by it in connection with bonds that are issued, and we have granted our bonding company a security interest in certain assets, including accounts receivable, as collateral for such obligation.

Government and Environmental Regulations
Our operations are subject to compliance with numerous regulatory requirements of federal, state and local agencies and authorities, including regulations concerning safety, wage and hour, and other labor issues, immigration controls, vehicle and equipment operations and other aspects of our business. For example, our construction operations are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws directed toward the protection of employees. In addition, most of our construction contracts are entered into with public authorities, and these contracts frequently impose additional governmental requirements, including requirements regarding labor relations and subcontracting with designated classes of disadvantaged businesses.
All of our operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to discharges into air, water and land, climate change, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, the handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. For example, we must apply water or chemicals to reduce dust on road construction projects and to contain contaminants in storm run-off water at construction sites. In certain circumstances, we may also be required to hire subcontractors to dispose of hazardous wastes encountered on a project in accordance with a plan approved in advance by the customer. Certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, impose strict and retroactive joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances.

CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and, in some instances, third parties, to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur.

Solid wastes, which may include hazardous wastes, are subject to the requirements of the Federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, referred to as RCRA, and comparable state statutes. Although we do not generate solid waste, we occasionally dispose of solid waste on behalf of customers. From time to time, the EPA considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes. Moreover, it is possible that additional wastes will in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes.” Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes.

We continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps at our locations to ensure compliance with environmental laws. While compliance with applicable regulatory requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future. In addition, tighter regulation for the protection of the environment and other factors may make it more difficult to obtain new permits and renewal of existing permits may be subject to more restrictive conditions than currently exist.

Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 1,935 employees, including 1,637 field personnel in our heavy civil construction division. Of the 1,637 heavy civil construction field employees, 311 were union members covered by collective bargaining agreements primarily in Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada. Our residential construction segment had approximately 56 employees, including 41 field personnel. None of the residential construction employees are union members.

Our business is dependent upon a readily available supply of management, supervisory and field personnel. Substantially all of our employees are hired on a full-time basis; however, as is typical in the construction industry, we experience a high degree of turnover as construction projects are completed. In the past, we have been able to attract sufficient numbers of personnel to support the growth of our operations. However, we continue to face competition for experienced workers in all our markets.

We focus on our safety processes which have allowed us to maintain a high level of safety at our work sites. All employees receive hazard specific training and our newly-hired employees undergo an initial safety orientation and receive follow-up trainings during their first 90 days of employment. Our project managers and superintendents work closely with the safety department to ensure safety is planned into all of our operations before they begin. Daily, our project foremen are required to conduct safety briefings with employees. Regular safety walkthroughs are conducted by our managers, supervisors and safety staff to evaluate project conditions and observe employee safety behavior.
