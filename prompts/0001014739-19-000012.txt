Item 1. | Business

Overview
BioScrip, Inc. (“BioScrip”, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) is a national provider of infusion and home care management solutions. We partner with physicians, hospital systems, payors, pharmaceutical manufacturers and skilled nursing facilities to provide patients access to post-acute care services. We operate with a commitment to bring customer-focused pharmacy and related healthcare infusion therapy services into the home or alternate-site setting. By collaborating with the full spectrum of healthcare professionals and the patient, we aim to provide cost-effective care that is driven by clinical excellence, customer service and values that promote positive outcomes and an enhanced quality of life for those whom we serve.
Our platform provides nationwide service capabilities and the ability to deliver clinical management services that offer patients a high-touch, community-based and home-based care environment. Our core services are provided in coordination with, and under the direction of, the patient’s physician. Our multidisciplinary team of clinicians, including pharmacists, nurses, dietitians and respiratory therapists, work with the physician to develop a plan of care suited to each patient’s specific needs. Whether in the home, physician office, ambulatory infusion center, skilled nursing facility or other alternate sites of care, we provide products, services and condition-specific clinical management programs tailored to improve the care of individuals with complex health conditions such as gastrointestinal abnormalities, infectious diseases, cancer, multiple sclerosis, organ and blood cell transplants, bleeding disorders, immune deficiencies and heart failure.
We were incorporated in Delaware in 1996 as MIM Corporation, with our primary business and operations at the time consisting of pharmacy benefit management services.
On September 9, 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of HS Infusion Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated June 11, 2016, by and among Home Solutions, a Delaware corporation, certain subsidiaries of Home Solutions, the Company and HomeChoice Partners, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Home Solutions, a privately held company, provided home infusion and home nursing products and services to patients suffering from chronic and acute medical conditions.
On August 27, 2015, we completed the sale of substantially all of our pharmacy benefit management services segment. We used the net proceeds from the PBM Sale to pay down a portion of our outstanding debt.
Our Strengths
Our company has a number of competitive strengths, including:
Local Competitive Market Position within Our National Platform and Infrastructure
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 68 service locations in 27 states. Our model combines local presence with comprehensive clinical programs for multiple therapies and specific delivery technologies (infusible and injectable). We have the capabilities and payor relationships to dispense prescriptions to all 50 states. We have relationships with approximately 1,000 payors, including Managed Care Organizations (“MCOs”), government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and commercial insurers (“Third Party Payors”). We believe payors generally favor fully integrated vendors that can provide high-touch pharmacy solutions to their patients. We believe we are one of a limited number of pharmacy providers that can offer a truly national, integrated and comprehensive approach to managing a patient’s chronic or acute conditions.
Diversified and Favorable Payor Base
We provide prescription drugs, infusion therapy and clinical management services for a broad range of commercial and governmental payors. Approximately 81% of our payor base is comprised of commercial payors that operate at a national, regional or local level. Aetna Health Management, LLC accounted for approximately 10% of consolidated net revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 and UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company accounted for 18% and 24% of consolidated net revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Government payors, including Medicare, state Medicaid and other government payors, accounted for 18% of consolidated revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Medicare accounted for 8% of our consolidated net revenue.

The costs savings realized by administering infusion therapies in the home versus hospitals, skilled nursing facilities or other post-acute care facilities positions our business to benefit from healthcare reform initiatives that focus on cost savings. Medicare currently offers limited reimbursement for home infusion therapy products and services. Although the Cures Act significantly reduced the level of reimbursement for certain of the therapies that we provide, we believe that home infusion and other low-cost in-home therapeutic alternatives will be impacted favorably by health reform initiatives focused on cost-reduction. Significant health plan cost savings per infusion can be achieved when therapy is provided at an alternative treatment site compared to other patient settings.
Effective Care Management Clinical Programs that are Designed to Produce Positive Clinical Outcomes and Reduce Readmissions
Our diversified and comprehensive clinical programs, which span numerous therapeutic areas, are designed to improve patient outcomes. Our home infusion business provides traditional infusion therapies for acute conditions with accompanying clinical management and home care. Our infusion product offerings and services are also designed to treat patients with chronic infusion needs. Chronic conditions require long-term treatment, ongoing caregiver and patient counseling and education, and ongoing monitoring and communication with physicians to encourage patients to follow therapies prescribed by their physicians.
Our Centers of Excellence focus on interdisciplinary teams to provide clinical excellence with outstanding personal service. Externally qualified by a panel of leading industry experts, these centers employ evidence-based standards of care, policies and procedures built on industry-recognized best practices. They are led by specialists with advanced certifications and training who are dedicated to developing, improving and sustaining clinical services to achieve optimal patient outcomes and exceed the expectations of patients and referral sources.
Our clinical management programs in multiple disease-state therapy provide us opportunities to cross-sell services. We believe we have earned a positive reputation among patients, physicians, payors and pharmaceutical manufacturers by providing quality service and favorable clinical outcomes. We believe our platform provides the necessary programs and services for better and more efficient clinical outcomes for our patients.
Services
We are one of the largest providers of home infusion services in the United States. Home infusion involves the preparation, delivery, administration and clinical monitoring of pharmaceutical treatments that are administered to a patient via intravenous (into the vein), subcutaneous (into the fatty layer under the skin), intramuscular (into the muscle), intra-spinal (into the membranes around the spinal cord) and enteral (into the gastrointestinal tract) methods. These methods are employed when a physician determines that the best outcome can be achieved through utilization of one or more of the therapies provided through the routes of administration described above.
Our home infusion services primarily involve the intravenous administration of medications to treat a wide range of acute and chronic conditions, such as infections, nutritional deficiencies, various immunologic and neurologic disorders, cancer, pain and palliative care. Our services are usually provided in the patient’s home but may also be provided at outpatient clinics, skilled nursing facilities, physician offices or at one of our ambulatory infusion centers. We receive payment for our home infusion services and medications, pursuant to provider agreements with government sources, such as Medicare and Medicaid programs, MCOs and Third Party Payors.
We provide a wide array of home infusion products and services to meet the diverse needs and preferences of physicians, patients and payors. Diseases commonly requiring infusion therapy include infections that are unresponsive to oral antibiotics, cancer and cancer-related pain, dehydration and gastrointestinal diseases or disorders that require IV fluids, parenteral or enteral nutrition. Other conditions that may be treated with infusion therapies include chronic diseases such as heart failure, Crohn’s disease, hemophilia, immune deficiencies, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, growth disorders and genetic enzyme deficiencies, such as Gaucher’s or Pompe’s disease. The therapies and products most commonly provided are listed below:
 6


Therapy Type | Description 
Parenteral Nutrition (PN) | Provide intravenous nutrition customized to the nutritional needs of the patient. PN is used in patients that cannot meet their nutritional needs via other means due to disease process or as a complication of a disease process, surgical procedure or congenital anomaly. PN may be used short term or chronically. 
Enteral Nutrition (EN) | Provide nutrition directly to the stomach or intestine in patients who cannot chew or swallow nutrients in the usual manner. EN may be delivered via a naso-gastric tube or a tube placed directly into the stomach or intestine. EN may be used short term or chronically. 
Antimicrobial Therapy (AT) | Provide intravenous antimicrobial medications used in the treatment of patients with various infectious processes such as: wound infections, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, cystic fibrosis, Lyme disease and cellulitis. AT may also be used in patients with disease processes or therapies that may lead to infections when oral antimicrobials are not effective. 
Chemotherapy | Provide injectable and/or infused medications in the home or the prescriber’s office for the treatment of cancer. Adjuvant medications may also be provided to minimize the side effects associated with chemotherapy. 
Immune Globulin (IG) Therapy | Provide immune globulins intravenously or subcutaneously on an as-needed basis in patients with immune deficiencies or auto-immune diseases. This therapy may be chronic based on the etiology of the immune deficiency. 
Pain Management | Provide analgesic medications intravenously, subcutaneously or epidurally. This therapy is generally administered as a continuous infusion via an internal or external infusion pump to treat severe pain associated with diseases such as COPD, cancer and severe injury. 
Blood Factor Therapies | Provide medications to patients with one of several inherited bleeding disorders in which a patient does not manufacture the clotting factors necessary, or use the clotting factors their liver makes, appropriately in order to halt an external or internal bleed in response to a physical injury or trauma. 
Inotropes Therapy | Provide intravenous inotropes in the home for the treatment of heart failure, either in anticipation of cardiac transplant or to provide palliation of heart failure symptoms. Inotropes increase the strength of weak heart muscles to pump blood. The therapy is only started in late phase heart failure when alternative therapies proved inadequate. 
Respiratory Therapy/Home Medical Equipment | Provide oxygen systems, continuous or bi-level positive airway pressure devices, nebulizers, home ventilators, respiratory devices, respiratory medications and other medical equipment. 

Patients generally are referred to us by physicians, hospital discharge planners, MCOs and other referral sources. Our medications are compounded and dispensed under the supervision of a registered pharmacist in a state licensed pharmacy that is accredited by an independent accrediting organization. We compound pursuant to a patient specific prescription and do so consistently with U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention (“USP”) 797 standards. A national accrediting organization surveys our pharmacies for compliance with the USP 797 standards for sterile drug compounding pharmacies and has confirmed that we operate consistently with those standards. Therapies are typically administered in the patient’s home by a registered nurse or trained caregiver. Depending on the preferences of the patient or the payor, these services may also be provided at one of our ambulatory infusion centers, a physician's office or another alternate site of administration.
We currently have relationships with a large number of MCOs and other Third Party Payors to provide home infusion services. These relationships are at a national, regional or local level. A key element of our business strategy is to leverage our relationships, geographic coverage, clinical expertise and reputation in order to gain contracts with payors. Our infusion service contracts typically provide for us to receive a fee for preparing and delivering medications and related equipment to patients in their homes or in Ambulatory Infusion Sites (“AIS”). Pricing for pharmaceutical products is typically negotiated in advance on the basis of Average Wholesale Price (“AWP”) minus some percentage of contractual discount, or Average Sales Price (“ASP”) plus some percentage. In addition, we typically receive a per diem payment for additional services and supplies provided to patients in connection with infusion services. An additional payment is made for nursing services when services are provided.

Sales and Marketing
We have over 260 sales and marketing representatives and approximately 1,000 payor relationships including MCOs, Medicare Part D pharmacy networks, other government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and other Third Party Payors. Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on payors, healthcare systems and physician prescribers and are driven by dedicated managed care and physician sales teams as well as home health care consultants. Our sales and marketing strategies include the development of strong relationships with key referral sources, such as physicians, hospital discharge planners, case managers, long-term care facilities and other healthcare professionals, primarily through regular contact with the referral sources and by fulfilling the care and service expectations of our many customers. Contracts with Third Party Payors, including MCOs, are an integral component for sales success.
Intellectual Property
We own and use a variety of trademarks, trade names and service marks, including without limitation “BioScrip”, “BioScrip Infusion Services”, “BioScrip Nursing Services”, “BioScrip Pharmacy Services”, “CarePoint Partners”, “HomeChoice Partners”, “InfuScience”, “InfusionCare”, “Infusion Partners”, “Infusion Solutions”, “New England Home Therapies”, “Option Health”, “Professional Home Care Services”, “Wilcox Home Infusion”, and “Home Solutions”, each of which has either been registered at the state or federal level or is being used pursuant to common law rights. We are recognized in local markets by several of these trade names, but we do not consider the marks material to our business.
Competition
The home infusion services market is highly competitive and includes a limited number of national providers and numerous local and regional companies. Providers strive to differentiate their services based on their responsiveness to patient needs, quality of care, reputation, outcomes, and cost of service. Our Centers of Excellence offer a high touch, high service approach to care on a local basis, which we believe differentiates our service.
Our competitors within the home infusion market include Option Care, Coram CVS/specialty infusion services (a division of CVS Health), Accredo Health Group, Inc. (a unit of Cigna), Briova (a subsidiary of OptumRx, which is a unit of the UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company) and various regional and local providers of alternate site healthcare services such as hospitals and physician practices.
Government Regulation
The healthcare industry is subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental entities at the federal, state and local level. Laws and regulations in the healthcare industry are extremely complex and, in many instances, the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation. Our business is impacted not only by those laws and regulations that are directly applicable to us but also by certain laws and regulations that are applicable to our payors, vendors and referral sources. While our management believes we are in substantial compliance with all of the existing laws and regulations applicable to us, such laws and regulations are subject to rapid change and often are uncertain in their application and enforcement. Further, to the extent we engage in new business initiatives, we must continue to evaluate whether new laws and regulations are applicable to us. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to scrutiny or challenge under one or more of these laws or that any enforcement actions would not be successful. Any such challenge, whether or not successful, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and consolidated financial statements. 
Among the various federal and state laws and regulations that may govern or impact our current and planned operations are the following:
Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement
Many of the products and services that we provide are reimbursed by Medicare and state Medicaid programs and are therefore subject to extensive government regulation. 
Medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance coverage for qualified persons age 65 or older, some disabled persons, and persons with end-stage renal disease and persons with Lou Gehrig’s disease. Medicaid programs are jointly funded by the federal and state governments and are administered by states under approved plans.
 8

Medicaid provides medical benefits to eligible people with limited income and resources and people with disabilities, among others. Although the federal government establishes general guidelines for the Medicaid program, each state sets its own guidelines regarding eligibility and covered services. Some individuals, known as dual eligibles, may be eligible for benefits under both Medicare and a state Medicaid program. Reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs is contingent on the satisfaction of numerous rules and regulations, including those requiring certification and/or licensure. Congress often enacts legislation that affects the reimbursement rates under government healthcare programs.
Approximately 18% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was derived directly from Medicare, Medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs. Also, we indirectly provide services to beneficiaries of Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored healthcare programs through managed care entities. Should there be material changes to federal or state reimbursement methodologies, regulations or policies, our direct reimbursements from government-sponsored healthcare programs, as well as service fees that relate indirectly to such reimbursements, could be adversely affected. 
Medicare
We receive reimbursement for infusion therapy under the Medicare program, which has four parts. Medicare Part A generally covers inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, home nursing and hospice services; Medicare Part B covers physicians' services, outpatient services, items and services provided by medical suppliers and a limited number of prescription drugs; Medicare Part C allows beneficiaries to enroll in private healthcare plans (known as Medicare Advantage plans); and Medicare Part D provides for a voluntary prescription drug benefit.
Medicare fee-for-service programs, Part A and Part B, generally cover infusion therapy provided in hospitals and hospital outpatient departments, skilled nursing facilities, and physician offices. Part A covers infusion therapy services under the home health benefit if the services are rendered by a Medicare-certified home health agency and the beneficiary meets criteria for homebound status. Part B generally does not cover the full range of services for infusion therapies in a patient’s home but it covers a limited number of drugs administered using an external infusion pump under the durable medical equipment (“DME”) benefit. Although Medicare Part D covers payment for drugs (including many not covered under Part B) and a retail-based dispensing fee, Part D does not cover infusion-related services, equipment and supplies. For eligible Medicare beneficiaries, the cost of equipment and supplies associated with infused drugs covered under Medicare Part D may be reimbursed on a limited basis under Part A or Part B, and the cost of associated professional services may be reimbursed on a limited basis under Medicare Part A. CMS has attempted to clarify the relationship of Part B and Part D with regard to coverage of infused drugs. CMS has stated that coverage is generally determined by the diagnosis and the method of drug delivery.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) and CMS continue to issue regulations and guidance with regard to the Medicare Part D program and compliance by Medicare Part D sponsors and their subcontractors. The receipt of funds made available through Medicare Part D is subject to compliance with government laws and regulations and provisions in contracts with prescription drug plans. There are many uncertainties about the financial and regulatory risks of participating in the Medicare Part D program, and these risks could negatively impact our business in future periods.
Medicare Advantage
Under Medicare Part C, also known as Medicare Advantage, beneficiaries can choose to enroll in a health insurance plan administered by an MCO. Medicare Advantage plans are required to offer the benefits covered under Medicare Part A and Part B, with the exception of hospice care, and may include additional benefits. To serve Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, a provider must contract with a Medicare Advantage plan. Reimbursement and other requirements imposed on the provider are governed by the agreement with the Medicare Advantage plan rather than by statute or regulation and as such vary from plan to plan. Medicare Advantage plans are permitted to cover certain services that fee-for-service Medicare does not cover. Home infusion therapy services are covered under many Medicare Advantage plans. We currently have contracts with a number of Medicare Advantage plans.
Changes to Medicare Reimbursement
In recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations and reductions in reimbursement under government healthcare programs. For example, the Cures Act, which Congress passed in December of 2016, changed the payment methodology for certain infusion drugs under the Part B DME benefit. Significant reductions to the amount paid by Medicare for many infusion drugs took effect January 1, 2017. In addition, the Cures Act provides for the implementation of a clinical services payment under Part B for “qualified home infusion therapy suppliers.” Under this new payment system, Medicare will reimburse home infusion therapy suppliers based on a single, all-inclusive rate. The services payment provision does not take effect until 
 9

January 1, 2021. However, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 provides for temporary transitional benefit payments, starting January 1, 2019, for Medicare Part B home infusion services. CMS finalized a rule in October 2018 to implement this temporary benefit, which will continue until January 1, 2021 when the services payment in the Cures Act takes effect. We have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the Cures Act on our business, but the Act has had a material negative impact on our revenues and profitability.
Medicaid
Medicaid coverage of infusion therapy varies by state. We are sensitive to possible changes in state Medicaid programs. Budgetary concerns in many states have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reductions to Medicaid reimbursement and delays in payment of outstanding claims. In addition, many states have implemented or are considering strategies to reduce coverage, restrict eligibility, or enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs. As of January 1, 2018, all pharmacies participating in a Medicaid managed care program must be registered with the state Medicaid agency. Any reductions to or delays in collecting amounts reimbursable by state Medicaid programs for our products or services, or changes in regulations governing such reimbursements, could cause our revenue and profitability to decline and increase our working capital requirements. Effective January 1, 2018, CMS limited Medicaid reimbursement for DME to no more than Medicare payment rates. For further discussion on state Medicaid reductions, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7.
In addition, some Medicaid programs only allow for reimbursement to pharmacies residing in the state or in a border state. While we believe we can service our current Medicaid patients through our existing infusion pharmacies, there can be no assurance that additional states will not enact in-state dispensing requirements for their Medicaid programs. To the extent such requirements are enacted, certain therapeutic pharmaceutical reimbursements could be adversely affected.
State Legislation and Other Matters Affecting Drug Prices
Many states have adopted “most favored nation” legislation, which limits the amount a pharmacy participating in the state Medicaid program is paid based on the pharmacy’s prices applicable to third party plans, or in some instances, self-pay patients. Because of these limitations, we may not receive the full Medicaid fee schedule amounts in some instances. There is wide variation in drafting, interpretation and enforcement of state “most favored nation” legislation. Our management carefully considers these laws and believes that each of our respective companies is in material compliance with them; however, we cannot predict whether the regulators will disagree with our interpretation or change their interpretation of the laws or their enforcement priorities.
Pricing benchmarks in the pharmacy industry are published by third-parties such as First DataBank, Medi-Span, Micromedex, RJ Health, and CMS. The Average Wholesale Price (“AWP”) is one of the most commonly used benchmarks. Although various payors have discussed establishing a new benchmark and First DataBank ceased publication of the AWP, the industry has not yet developed a viable generally accepted alternative to the AWP benchmark. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Changes in industry pricing benchmarks could adversely affect our financial performance.”
Healthcare Reform
In recent years, federal and state governments have considered and enacted policy changes designed to reform the healthcare industry. The most prominent of these healthcare reform efforts, the Affordable Care Act, has resulted in sweeping changes to the U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care. As currently structured, the Affordable Care Act increases the number of persons covered under government programs and private insurance; furnishes economic incentives for measurable improvements in health care quality outcomes; promotes a more integrated health care delivery system and the creation of new health care delivery models; revises payment for health care services under the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and increases government enforcement tools and sanctions for combating fraud and abuse. In addition, the Affordable Care Act reduced cost sharing for Medicare beneficiaries under the Part D prescription drug benefit program and expanded medication therapy management services for individuals with chronic conditions. 
However, the future of the Affordable Care Act is uncertain. The Affordable Care Act has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges, and the presidential administration and certain members of Congress have expressed their intent to repeal or make additional significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation or interpretation. The president has signed an executive order that directs agencies to minimize “economic and regulatory burdens” of the Affordable Care Act. Final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all of the essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Effective January 1, 2019, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate. These changes may affect the number of individuals electing to purchase health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. Further, because the financial penalty associated with individual mandate was eliminated, a federal court in Texas ruled in December 2018 
 10

that the entire Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional. However, the law remains in place pending appeal. The impact of these developments or repeal of or further changes to the Affordable Care Act, as well as the impact of any alternative provisions, on the healthcare industry and our business is unknown. Members of Congress have also proposed measures that would expand government-funded coverage, such as single-payor proposals. Other industry participants, such as private payors and large employer groups and their affiliates, may also introduce financial or delivery system reforms. We are unable to predict the nature and success of such initiatives. 
Regulation of the Pharmacy Industry
For each physical pharmacy location in a state, laws require maintenance of an in-state pharmacy license to dispense pharmaceuticals. Pharmacy and controlled substances laws often address the qualifications of personnel, the adequacy of prescription fulfillment and inventory control practices and the adequacy of facilities. We believe our pharmacy locations materially comply with all state licensing laws applicable to their practice. If our pharmacy locations become subject to additional licensure requirements, are unable or otherwise fail to maintain their required licenses or if states place overly burdensome restrictions or limitations on pharmacies, our ability to operate in some states would be limited, which could have an adverse impact on our business. We believe the impact of any such requirements would be mitigated by our ability to shift business among our numerous locations.
Many states, as well as the federal government, are considering imposing, or have already begun to impose, more stringent requirements on compounding pharmacies including the Drug Quality and Security Act (“DQSA”) (see Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act below). We believe that our compounding is done in safe environments with clinically appropriate policies and procedures in place. Those compounding pharmacies adhere to rigorous safety and quality standards for compounded sterile preparations and only fill prescriptions for individually identified patients pursuant to a valid prescription from a prescriber. All compounding is done consistently with USP 797 standards.
Many of the states into which we deliver pharmaceuticals have laws and regulations that require out-of-state pharmacies to register with or be licensed by the boards of pharmacy or similar regulatory bodies in those states. These states generally permit the dispensing pharmacy to follow the laws of the state within which the dispensing pharmacy is located. However, various state pharmacy boards have enacted laws and/or adopted rules or regulations directed at restricting or prohibiting the operation of out-of-state pharmacies by, among other things, requiring compliance with all laws of the states into which the out-of-state pharmacy dispenses medications, whether or not those laws conflict with the laws of the state in which the pharmacy is located, or requiring the pharmacist-in-charge to be licensed in that state. To the extent that such laws or regulations are applicable to our operations, we believe we comply with them. To the extent that the foregoing laws or regulations prohibit or restrict the operation of out-of-state pharmacies and are found to be applicable to us, they could have an adverse effect on our operations.
Laws enforced by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) require each of our pharmacy locations to register with the DEA in order to handle and dispense controlled substances. A separate registration is required at each principal place of business where we dispense controlled substances. Federal and state laws also require us to follow specific labeling, reporting and record-keeping requirements for controlled substances. We maintain federal and state controlled substance registrations for each of our facilities that require such registration and follow procedures intended to comply with all applicable federal and state requirements regarding controlled substances. These laws can change from time to time. We continuously review these changes to laws and believe we are in material compliance with the applicable federal and state controlled substances laws. If any of our pharmacy locations is deemed to be out of compliance, it could have an adverse impact on our business. 
Many states in which we operate also require home infusion companies to be licensed as home health agencies. We believe we are compliant with these laws in all material respects. If our infusion locations become subject to new licensure requirements, are unable to maintain required licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on home health agencies or home nursing agencies, our infusion locations’ ability to provide nursing services in some states would be limited, which could have an adverse impact on our business.
Each of our pharmacies and infusion locations are eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. If any provider were to lose its Medicare or Medicaid certification, the provider would be unable to receive reimbursement from federal healthcare programs. The conditions for Medicare and Medicaid participation vary depending on the type of facility, but, in general, require our facilities to meet specified standards relating to licensure, personnel, patient rights, patient care, patient records, physical site, administrative reporting and legal compliance. The requirements for certification are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services. For example, in October 2018, CMS finalized a rule that implements quality standards for home infusion suppliers. 
 11

The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation also include notification or approval in the event of the transfer or change of ownership or certain other changes. Failure to provide required notifications or obtain necessary approvals in these circumstances can result in the inability to complete an acquisition or change of ownership, loss of licensure, lapses in reimbursement or other penalties.
Professional Licensure
Nurses, pharmacists and certain other professionals employed by us are required to be individually licensed and/or certified under applicable state law. We perform criminal and other background checks on employees to the extent allowed by state law and confirm that our employees possess all licenses and certifications required in order to provide healthcare-related services. We believe our employees comply with applicable licensure laws.
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act 
Pharmacy operations
Certain provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) govern the preparation, handling, storage, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Many of the pharmaceuticals and medical devices we dispense are exempt from certain federal requirements as long as they are not adulterated or misbranded and are dispensed in accordance with, and pursuant to, a valid prescription.
The FDA directly regulates outsourcing facilities, but does not directly regulate non-outsourcing facilities or pharmacies. Outsourcing facilities are pharmacies that are engaged in sterile compounding of drugs that are not for an individually identifiable patient. Outsourcing facilities are subject to standards relating to sterilization and the physical facility including the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations. Because our compounding activities are limited to products compounded pursuant to valid prescriptions for individually identifiable patients, we do not qualify as an outsourcing facility, and therefore, should not be required to comply with the cGMP standards. The FDA has been conducting inspections of pharmacies that engage in compounding, including ours, and has been attempting to apply the cGMP standards even though those pharmacies are not outsourcing facilities. While the FDA has issued reports following their surveys, to date, no enforcement action has been taken against us. We cannot predict what further actions the FDA may take. We believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and that the requirements for outsourcing facilities are not applicable to our operations. We cannot predict the impact of increased scrutiny on or new regulation of compounding pharmacies.
In addition, the FDCA governs pharmaceutical products’ movement in interstate commerce. The FDA has begun scrutinizing more closely compounding pharmacies’ operations and compounded pharmaceuticals’ movement in interstate commerce. Specifically, the FDA has proposed regulations that could have the effect of limiting our ability to ship prescriptions out of state by pharmacies that hold valid licenses but do not comply with cGMP standards. We do not know if these regulations, as proposed, will be adopted, but if they are, we will likely need to modify our operations to comply. While we cannot predict changes to the regulatory environment under the DQSA, we believe we comply in all material respects with all applicable requirements of a non-outsourcing-facility pharmacy.
Infusion services
The FDA regulates certain medical devices (e.g., infusion pumps) essential to the Company’s infusion services. An infusion pump, like any medical device, is subject to failure. Since 2010, due to the relatively large number of adverse events associated with the use of infusion pumps, FDA has increased its oversight of infusion pumps. Changes have included higher levels of scrutiny, intensifying manufacturer engagement and bolstering user education and adverse event reporting. The shifting regulatory climate around infusion pumps; the requirement to maintain high levels of proficiency in using and training patients in the safe use of infusion pumps; cybersecurity issues, including modification and misuse of infusion pumps, and unauthorized use of information that is stored on or accessed from infusion pumps; and, finally, the need to stay current in infusion pump design and “best practices,” present elements of risk. Nevertheless, we believe we comply in all material respects with all applicable requirements and that our employees are adequately trained and equipped to use these devices.
Fraud and Abuse Laws
Anti-Kickback Laws
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it a felony for a person or entity to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration with the intent of inducing the referral of an individual or the purchase, lease or order (or the arranging 
 12

for or recommending of the purchase, lease or order) of healthcare items or services paid for in whole or in part by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. Courts have held that there is a violation of the statute even if only one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute could subject us to criminal and/or civil penalties, including suspension or exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs and other government-funded healthcare programs. In addition, submission of a claim for items or services generated in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may also be the basis of liability under the federal False Claims Act (“False Claims Act”). 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted broadly by courts, the OIG and other administrative bodies. For example, although the term “remuneration” is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, it has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, donations, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing any item, service, or compensation for something other than fair market value. Because of the broad scope of the statute, there are several statutory exceptions to the law, and federal regulations establish certain safe harbors from liability. For example, there are safe harbors relating to certain discounts received from vendors, investment interests, group purchasing organizations, managed care and waivers of copayment obligations. A practice that does not fall within a safe harbor is not necessarily unlawful, but may be subject to increased scrutiny and challenge by government enforcement authorities.
Governmental entities have investigated pharmacies and their dealings with pharmaceutical manufacturers concerning, among other things, retail distribution, sales and marketing practices and product conversion or product switching programs. Governmental entities have also investigated pharmacies with respect to their relationships with physicians and other referral sources, including marketing practices. There can be no assurance that we will not receive subpoenas or be requested to produce documents in pending investigations or litigation from time to time. In addition, we may be the target or subject of one or more such investigations or named parties in corresponding actions.
In 2003, the OIG released Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (the “Guidance”), which provides voluntary, nonbinding guidance in devising effective compliance programs to assist companies that develop, manufacture, market and sell pharmaceutical products or biological products. The Guidance sets forth the fundamental elements of a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s compliance program and principles that should be considered when creating, implementing, and maintaining an effective compliance program. While we are not a manufacturer, we believe that many aspects of it are useful to our business and therefore we currently maintain a compliance program that includes the key compliance program elements described in the Guidance. We believe the fundamental elements of our compliance programs are consistent with the principles, policies and intent of the Guidance.
A number of states have enacted anti-kickback laws that may apply not only to state-sponsored healthcare programs, but also to items or services that are paid for by private insurance and self-pay patients. State anti-kickback laws can vary considerably in their applicability and scope and sometimes have fewer statutory and regulatory exceptions than does the federal law. Our management carefully considers the importance of such anti-kickback laws when structuring each company’s operations and believes that each of our respective companies is in compliance therewith.
The Stark Laws
The federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients for “designated health services” to an entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member of the physician, has a direct or indirect financial relationship, unless the financial relationship is structured to meet an applicable exception. Designated health services include outpatient prescription drugs, DME and supplies, parenteral and enteral nutrient, equipment and supplies, and home health services. An entity that bills Medicare or Medicaid for designated health services that result from a prohibited referral is required to refund amounts collected pursuant to the prohibited referral on a timely basis. Penalties for violation of the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. A knowing violation of the Stark Law can also constitute a violation of the federal False Claims Act. Our management carefully considers the Stark Law and its accompanying regulations in structuring our financial relationships with physicians and believes we are in compliance therewith.
We are also subject to state statutes and regulations that prohibit self-referral arrangements. The laws and exceptions or safe harbors may vary from the federal Stark Law and vary significantly from state to state. Some of these state statutes mirror the federal Stark Law while others are broader. For example, some state statutes and regulations apply to services reimbursed by governmental as well as private payors, and some extend to providers other than physicians. Violation of these laws may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered, loss of pharmacy or health provider licenses, fines and criminal penalties. The state laws are often vague and, in many cases, have not been widely interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies. We believe we are in compliance with such laws.

Statutes Prohibiting False Claims and Fraudulent Billing Activities
A range of federal civil and criminal laws target the submission of false claims and fraudulent billing activities. One of the most significant of these laws is the federal False Claims Act, which provides for liability of treble damages and civil penalties for knowingly making or causing to be made false claims in order to secure reimbursement from government-sponsored programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Investigations or actions commenced under the False Claims Act may be brought either by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government, through a “whistleblower” or “qui tam” action. The False Claims Act authorizes the payment of a portion of any recovery to the individual bringing suit. Such actions are initially required to be filed under seal pending their review by the Department of Justice. If the government intervenes in the lawsuit and prevails, the whistleblower (or plaintiff filing the initial complaint) may share with the federal government in any settlement or judgment. If the government does not intervene in the lawsuit, the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue the action independently. The False Claims Act may result in substantial financial penalties for small billing errors that are replicated in a large number of claims, as each individual claim could be deemed to be a separate violation of the False Claims Act. Significantly, the Affordable Care Act amended the False Claims Act to impose liability for knowing failures to return overpayments which, under the Affordable Care Act’s 60-Day Rule, include failures to report and return an overpayment to the government within 60 days after it is identified.
The False Claims Act has been used by the federal government and private whistleblowers to bring enforcement actions under fraud and abuse laws like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law, increasing potential financial exposure for alleged violations. Such actions are based on the theory that when an entity submits a claim, it either expressly or impliedly certifies that it has provided the underlying services in compliance with material laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statute or Stark Law. Liability may result even if the claims are otherwise billed accurately for appropriate and medically necessary services. These actions are costly and time-consuming to defend.
Some states also have enacted statutes similar to the False Claims Act, which may include criminal penalties, substantial fines, and treble damages, and some allow individuals to bring qui tam actions. Federal law provides an incentive to states to enact false claims laws comparable to the federal False Claims Act. 
In recent years, federal and state governments have launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices that violate false claims or fraudulent billing laws. We have experienced increasing audit activity by enforcement entities, and we may be the subject of future audits. We believe we have procedures in place to ensure the accuracy of our claims. While we believe we are in compliance with Medicaid and Medicare billing rules and requirements, there can be no assurance that regulators would agree with the methodology employed by us in billing for our products and services. A material disagreement with governmental agencies on the manner in which we provide or bill for products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and Consolidated Financial Statements.
Civil Monetary Penalties Act
The Civil Monetary Penalties Law authorizes the U.S. Secretary of HHS to impose civil money penalties, assessments and program supervision or exclusion for various forms of fraud and abuse involving the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Penalties of up to $100,000 for each violation may be imposed, depending on the specific misconduct involved. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. In some cases, violations of the Civil Monetary Penalty Law may result in penalties of up to three times the remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received, and may also result in exclusion from government healthcare programs. The availability of the Civil Money Penalties Law to enforce alleged fraud and abuse violations has increased the potential for enforcement actions, as it requires a lower burden of proof than some criminal statutes, and it has increased the potential financial exposure for such actions. These actions are costly and time-consuming to defend.
Other Fraud & Abuse Laws
We are also subject to additional fraud and abuse laws, including federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Federal enforcement authorities may exclude from Medicare and Medicaid any business entities and any investors, officers and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed health care fraud. Officers and managing employees may be excluded even if they had no knowledge of the fraud.
We may also be subject to laws promoting transparency of financial relationships with providers and other potential referral sources. For example, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires pharmaceutical, biological, device, and medical supply

manufacturers to report payments or other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests. These initiatives may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities or impact our public reputation.
Confidentiality, Privacy and HIPAA
Many of our activities involve the receipt, use and/or disclosure of confidential medical, pharmacy or other health-related information concerning individual patients, including the disclosure of such confidential information to an individual's health plan. 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and its implementing regulations, as amended, give people greater control over the privacy of their medical information. The federal privacy regulations (the “Privacy Regulations”) are designed to protect health-related information that could be used to identify an individual, also known as protected health information (“PHI”). Among numerous other requirements, the Privacy Regulations: (i) limit permissible uses and disclosures of PHI; (ii) limit most uses and disclosures of PHI to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose; (iii) require patient authorization for uses and disclosures of PHI unless an exception applies; and (iv) guarantee patients the right to access their medical records and to receive an accounting of certain disclosures. The federal security regulations (the “Security Regulations”) set certain standards regarding the storage, utilization of, access to and transmission of electronic PHI. The federal breach notification regulations (the “Breach Notification Regulations”) require notification to individuals, the federal government and, in some cases, the media in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI.
These regulations apply to “covered entities,” which include most healthcare providers and health plans, and some of these regulations apply to “business associates,” which are persons or entities that perform or assist in performing services or activities for or on behalf of a covered entity, if the performance of those services or activities involves the creation, receipt, maintenance or transmission of PHI. HIPAA also requires that a covered entity and its business associates enter into written contracts whereby the business associate agrees to restrict its use and disclosure of PHI. We provide a varied line of services to patients and other entities. When we are acting as a pharmacy or health care provider, we function as a covered entity. There may also be situations when we act on behalf of another covered entity as a business associate.
The requirements imposed by HIPAA are extensive, and it has required substantial cost and effort to assess and implement measures to comply with those requirements. We have taken and intend to continue to take steps that we believe are reasonably necessary to ensure our policies and procedures are in compliance with the Privacy Regulations, the Security Regulations and the Breach Notification Regulations. The requirements imposed by HIPAA have increased our burden and costs of regulatory compliance (including our health improvement programs and other information-based products), altered our reporting and reduced the amount of information we can use or disclose if patients do not authorize such uses or disclosures.
Some federal and state privacy-related laws are more restrictive than HIPAA and could result in additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches. In addition, most states have enacted privacy and security laws, including laws that protect particularly sensitive medical information (such as HIV status or mental health records) and breach notification laws that may impose an obligation to notify persons if their personal information has or may have been accessed by an unauthorized person. Some of these laws apply to our business and have increased and will continue to increase our burden and costs of privacy and security-related regulatory compliance.
