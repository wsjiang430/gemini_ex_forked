ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  Overview MicroVision, Inc. is a pioneer in laser beam scanning (LBS) technology that we market under our brand name PicoP®. We have developed our proprietary scanning technology that can be used in products for interactive projection, consumer LiDAR, automotive LiDAR, and augmented and mixed reality. Our PicoP® scanning technology is based on our patented expertise in systems that include micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS), laser diodes, opto-mechanics, and electronics and how those elements are packaged into a small form factor, low power scanning engine that can display, interact and sense, depending on the needs of the application. These systems utilize edge computing and machine intelligence as part of the solutions. Our strategy includes selling LBS engines to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs). We plan to offer scanning engines to support a wide array of applications: an interactive scanning engine for smart home speakers and other Internet of Things (IoT) products, a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) engine for consumer electronic applications, and solutions for augmented and mixed reality devices. We also are developing LiDAR for automotive collision avoidance systems. In addition to selling engines, we have licensed our patented PicoP® scanning technology to other companies for incorporation into their scanning engines for projection. We sell our customers key components needed to produce their laser scanning engines and/or license our technology in exchange for a royalty fee or margin for each scanning engine they sell. Companies to whom we license our PicoP® scanning technology are typically OEMs or ODMs who are in the business of making components or products ready for sale to end users. To date, we have primarily focused on the consumer electronics market, however, we believe that our LBS technology could support multiple applications and markets including automotive, medical, and industrial.  While we are optimistic about our technology and the potential for future revenues, we have incurred substantial losses since inception and we expect to incur a significant loss during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  MicroVision, Inc. was founded in 1993 as a Washington corporation and reincorporated in 2003 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our headquarters is located at 6244 185th Avenue NE, Suite 100, Redmond, Washington 98052, and our telephone number is (425) 936-6847.  Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are available free-of-charge from the investor page of our website, accessible at www.microvision.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Copies of these filings may also be obtained by visiting the SEC's website, www.sec.gov, which contains current, quarterly and annual reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.  1   
Technology Our patented PicoP® scanning technology combines a MEMS scanning mirror, laser diode light sources, electronics, and optics that are controlled using our proprietary system control algorithms along with edge computing and machine learning in some systems. The bi-directional MEMS scanning mirror is a key component of our technology system and is one of our core competencies. Our MEMS design is a silicon device with a one-millimeter mirror at the center. This mirror is connected to small flexures that allow it to oscillate vertically and horizontally to generate an image pixel-by-pixel for use in sensing and display. Scanning engines with our technology can operate in three modes: display only, display and sensing combined, and sensing only. For applications that include a projected display, our PicoP® scanning technology creates a brilliant, full color, high-contrast, uniform image over the entire field-of-view from a small and thin engine with low power consumption. For 3D LiDAR scanning applications, our engine is small with high resolution, low power and low latency which are features that are important for such applications. We believe that our proprietary technology offers significant advantages over traditional display and 3D LiDAR sensing systems. Depending on the specific product application, these advantages may include: 
Ability to perform projection and three-dimensional sensing and image capture from a single device;
Leveraging our custom MEMS and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) components across multiple engine types for economies of scale;
Focus-free operation;
HD resolution;
Low power requirements to enable battery operated devices and applications;
Small and thin engine size;
High-brightness, high-dynamic range, and brightness uniformity;
Rich, saturated color reproduction;
Short throw projection with multi-mode operation for table top and wall mode;
3D LiDAR sensing as a touch interface or point cloud;
Dynamic, programmable resolution and frame rate 3D scanning; and
Efficiency of edge computing and machine learning integrated within our solution. Business Strategy Our business strategy is to commercialize our PicoP® scanning technology by enabling OEMs and ODMs to produce end-user products via three go-to-market paths: 
Design and sell LBS engines directly to OEMs and ODMs to incorporate inside their products;
License our LBS technology and sell key components to OEMs and ODMs to create their own scanning engines; and
License LBS technology to OEMs and ODMs who developed their own key components or subsystems.  By providing these options, we permit OEMs and ODMs to integrate and embed our technology across a broad range of interactive and non-interactive display and 3D LiDAR sensing product applications in the way that best matches their technical capabilities and timelines for bringing their products to market.  The key elements of our business strategy include the following: 
Develop LBS modules that enable our customers to make products that end users find indispensable;
Continue to improve the performance of our PicoP® scanning technology system by advancing the key application attributes such as higher brightness for displays, lower power,
smaller size, and greater accuracy and longer distances for 3D sensing;
Develop machine learning algorithms that allow our 3D LiDAR sensing products to respond faster and more accurately to users and/or objects in the environment;
Sell LBS engines to OEMs and ODMs;
Provide engineering services to develop LBS engines for OEMs and ODMs who need custom engines;
Develop a supply chain able to supply customers with high quality LBS engines in quantities to support the consumer electronics market; 
  2   
Supply key scanning engine components for products being developed by OEMs and ODMs who license our PicoP® scanning technology and/or license rights to OEMs and ODMs
to produce such components; 
Partner with other companies that are interested in growing the LBS market to cooperatively promote our solutions and develop solutions for future products and capabilities where
appropriate; and
Maintain a position of LBS leadership with our intellectual property around our PicoP® scanning technology.  Markets for Our Technology Our PicoP® scanning technology system strategy is focused on addressing the following market segments:  
Interactive and non-interactive pico projection;
3D LiDAR sensing for consumer electronics, automotive collision avoidance; and
Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR). We see interactive and non-interactive pico projection, 3D LiDAR sensing, and AR/VR as the most promising applications for our technology in the near to mid-term. We have concentrated on pico projection over the past several years and we announced plans for other engine solutions for interactive pico projection and 3D LiDAR sensing. We also believe AR and VR eyewear displays can also benefit from our technology, and we are actively exploring these opportunities.  In interactive projection, our goal is to enable an interactive screen experience produced on demand by a small system for AI connected devices such as smart speakers. The solution would allow users to perform micro transactions by augmenting the capabilities of these voice controlled devices, making transactions more intuitive and easier to perform. By working on a variety of surfaces in conjunction with smart devices, these solutions provide the functionality of display screens while reducing the size requirements of display screens in the home.  We have developed 3D LiDAR sensing capabilities in our LBS engine. This allows the LBS engine to sense what is in front of it and where that object is in space. If we project an image on a surface and use our 3D LiDAR sensing capability concurrently, we are able to create an LBS engine where a user can touch the projected image or interact with the image using gestures and it will react much like a touchscreen. We call this interactive display. We believe that interactive display can enable a whole new category of smart IoT products.  Additionally, we are working to bring to market 3D LiDAR sensors. The consumer 3D LiDAR sensor we are developing is a small sensor able to capture information about what is in front of the sensor with high accuracy and high fidelity. We see applications for this sensor in smart home and smart home security products and in commercial space management. We are also working on LiDAR modules for automotive collision avoidance systems. Another application area for our PicoP® scanning technology that we are focused on is eyewear displays, also known as AR and VR. We have a long history with this application, and we believe the eyewear ecosystem has progressed to a point where we see future growth opportunities in this market.  Products and Services In 2018, our revenue was derived from development contracts and from license and royalty fees for PicoP® scanning technology.  In May 2018, we signed a five-year license agreement with a customer granting them an exclusive license to our LBS technology for display-only applications. The license represents functional intellectual property which derives a substantial portion of its utility from its significant standalone functionality. The intellectual property is not expected to substantially change during the license period, nor are we contractually or practically required to use updated intellectual property during the license life. During the year ended December 31, 2018 we completed the performance obligations required by the contract. As a result, we recognized $10.0 million in license revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. In April 2017, we signed a contract with a major technology company to develop an LBS display system. Under this agreement, we would develop a new generation of MEMS, ASIC and related firmware for a high resolution, LBS-based product that the technology company is planning to produce. We would receive up to $24.6 million, including $14.6 million in fees for development contingent on completion of milestones and an upfront payment of $10.0 million, which payment has been received. The original contract was for $14.0 million in fees for development, but the customer added $632,000 in additional work to total $14.6 million. As of December 31, 2018, we have received $10.7 million of the fees for development work. The remaining development fees would be paid contingent on completion of  3    milestones through the second quarter of 2019. Upon successful completion of the development program, if the company decides to manufacture the product with the MicroVision display components, the $10.0 million upfront payment would be applied as a discount to future component purchases from us. If the contract is terminated by the technology company for our failure to meet milestones, the $10.0 million upfront payment is subject to repayment. As the contract is expected to be completed in Q2 2019, we believe the risk of repayment is low. In 2017, we introduced a small form factor, high definition display engine for applications where form factor and flexibility of product design are required. In March 2017, we received a $6.7 million order for our small form factor display engine from Ragentek Communication Technology Co., Limited (Ragentek), an Asian electronics device manufacturer. Initial shipments of engines to Ragentek began at the end of June 2017 to embed in its smartphone product. Ragentek launched their smartphone during the third quarter of 2017. We had planned to recognize $4.3 million of product revenue during the fourth quarter of 2017 by completing the remainder of the order. The customer, however, requested a deferment in taking receipt of the remainder of the engines until 2018. In 2018 the customer did not take delivery of the remaining engines. We are pursuing our legal rights to enforce the contract. We also plan to introduce an interactive display engine that integrates display and 3D LiDAR sensing to allow the user to interact with projected images and a consumer grade LiDAR engine for consumer electronics (smart home and smart home security) applications.  The key components and technology we offer for inclusion in an LBS engine are our MEMS, ASICs, and software. Our licensees can purchase none, some, or all of the key components and license the technology we offer depending on their capability and desire to manufacture them and the terms of the licensing agreement. Research and Development We believe our research and development efforts have earned us a leadership position in the field of LBS technology and applications as applied to consumer electronics, automotive and other markets. Our ability to attract customers and grow revenue will depend on our ability to maintain our LBS technology leadership, to continually improve performance, reduce costs, reduce the size of component parts and scanning engines, and to increase the number of applications and products enabled by our PicoP® scanning technology. Our research and development team is located in Redmond, Washington and as of December 31, 2018, was comprised of 85 engineering and technical staff in optics, software engineering, electrical engineering, product engineering, and MEMS design. Sales and Marketing Our sales and marketing approach is account based, business-to-business targeting of OEMs and ODMs. We license our PicoP® scanning technology and sell components used in the production of scanning engines to our licensees and sell scanning engines to our customers. We also engage end product manufacturers and retailers in our target markets to educate them about product opportunities based on our PicoP® scanning technology. We currently have sales and business development representatives based in the United States and Asia, focused on business development in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Our sales and business development representatives are supported by a technical sales engineering team that assists customers during the "design win" and "design in" cycles. The technical sales engineering team operates from Redmond, Washington, and Japan. Our marketing team is located in Redmond, Washington. We engage potential customers directly, participate in trade shows, maintain a website, and cooperate on co-marketing activities with key partners.  Manufacturing Our products include scanning engines as well as components that are integral to a scanning engine. Our scanning engine products are manufactured by a contract manufacturer based on our proprietary design and incorporate our PicoP® scanning technology and include MEMS and ASICs that are produced to order by semiconductor foundries.  4   Our manufacturing is not currently subject to seasonal variations as our shipments have been relatively small and are in the early stages of product introduction. In the future, depending on our customers' product mix, we may be affected by seasonal fluctuations which could affect working capital demands.  We provide forecasts that allow our contract manufacturers to stock component parts and other materials and plan capacity. Our contract manufacturers procure raw materials in volumes consistent with our forecasts, manufacture and/or assemble the products and perform tests according to our specifications. Products are shipped to our customers or shipped to our Redmond, Washington headquarters to be inventoried as finished goods. We procure some specific components and either sell them or consign them to our contract manufacturers. We hold some inventories of these components. Our contract manufacturers procure additional raw materials we do not own until the finished goods are completed by our contract manufacturer. Title to the products transfers from our contract manufacturers to us and then to our customers upon shipment from the manufacturer. If raw materials are unused, or the products are not sold within specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for component parts that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecasts or customer orders. Many of the raw materials used in our components are standard to the consumer electronics industry. Our MEMS, MEMS die, and ASICs are currently manufactured to our specifications by separate single-source suppliers. Human Factors, Ergonomics and Safety We work with third party independent experts in the field of laser safety to assist in meeting safety specifications. In addition, we monitor developments in the area of permissible laser exposure limits as established by International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and others. Independent experts have concluded that laser exposure to the eye resulting from use of LBS devices under normal operating conditions would be below the calculated maximum permissible exposure level set by the IEC. Competitive Conditions The consumer display and 3D sensing industries are highly competitive. Potential products incorporating our PicoP® scanning technology, including any LBS engines we develop, will compete with manufacturers of established technologies, such as flat panel display devices, as well as companies developing new display and 3D LiDAR sensing technologies. Our competitors include companies such as Texas Instruments, Intel, Syndiant, Velodyne, Bosch, Quanergy, Innoluce, Opus, Mirrorcle, Maradin, Himax, Pioneer, Sony (LCOS) and others, some of which have much greater financial, technical and other resources than us. Many of our competitors are currently developing alternative miniature display and 3D LiDAR sensing technologies. Our competitors may succeed in developing innovative technologies and products that could render our technology or our proposed products commercially infeasible or technologically obsolete. The consumer display and 3D sensing industries have been characterized by rapid and significant technological advances. Our PicoP® scanning technology system and potential products may not be competitive with such advances, and we may not have sufficient funds to invest in new technologies, products or processes. Although we believe our technology system and proposed products could deliver images of a substantially higher performance from a smaller form factor device than those of commercially available LCOS and DLP based display products, LCD and LCOS interactive panels or solid state LiDAR and CMOS sensing solutions, manufacturers of competing technologies may develop improvements to their technology that could reduce or eliminate the anticipated advantages of our proposed products.  3D sensing is a new market and we believe we are developing products that will have cost and performance benefits over what competitors may offer. However, manufacturers of competing technologies may develop improvements to the size, performance, and cost of their modules, that could reduce or eliminate the anticipated advantages of our proposed products.  Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights We create intellectual property from three sources: internal research and development activities, technology acquisitions, and performance on development contracts. The inventions covered by our patent applications generally relate to systems controls in our PicoP® scanning technology, component miniaturization, power reduction, feature enhancements, specific implementation of various system components, and design elements to facilitate mass production.  5    Protecting these key-enabling technologies and components is a fundamental aspect of our strategy to penetrate diverse markets with unique products. As such, we intend to continue to develop our portfolio of proprietary and patented LBS technologies at the system, component, and process levels. We believe our extensive patent portfolio is the largest, broadest, and earliest filed LBS technology portfolio and includes applications such as augmented reality, range finding, portable media devices, image capture, and projection applications. We have over 500 issued patents, pending patents and licensed patents worldwide. Since our inception in 1993, we have acquired, either under license agreements or portfolio purchases, patents that grant us exclusive rights to various LBS technologies. From time to time some of these patents may expire, or we may decide to terminate a license agreement for a variety of reasons to better utilize resources expended to maintain intellectual property.  Our ability to compete effectively in the consumer display and 3D sensing markets may depend, in part, on our ability and the ability of our licensors to maintain the proprietary nature of these technologies. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. To protect our rights in these areas, we require all employees, and where appropriate, contractors, consultants, advisors and collaborators, to enter into confidentiality and non-compete agreements. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information.  We have registered the name "PicoP®" and "MicroVision®" with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  Employees As of March 1, 2019, we had 107 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
